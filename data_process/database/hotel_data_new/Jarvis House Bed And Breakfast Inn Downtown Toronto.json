It is most certainly is NOT \"immaculately maintained accommodations\".  It is not completely disgusting but for the price I expected a much nicer place.I would not stay here again, and do not recommend it.",

      "text": "If you're a little person or a fan of getting ripped off, then this is the European-style hostel for you. Upon arrival, I was informed that the room with a normal human-sized bed I booked wasn't available, but my girlfriend and I were expected to climb 4 flights of stairs to a cramped, former attic-space room with furnishings from the Late-Garage Sale Leftovers Era with 2 tiny twin beds. Being a tall, broad man, I informed the innkeeper that we would not be staying one night in the establishment, since no reasonable accomidation was offered. The slumlord seemed to understand that I couldn't spend my short stay in a tiny room with tiny beds, so I thought our business was done.I discovered the next day that my credit card had been charged the full 3 night rental rate. I returned to Jarvis to confront the innkeeper, where I was informed that the charges would not be reversed, but the room had been rented out in our absence. So, not only did the odd woman get my money, but she suckered someone else into the same trap and received their money, too. If it was about lost revenue, I would have received 2 nights' worth of a refund. It's about ripping people off. DO NOT FALL VICTIM TO THIS SCAM.Booking.com and Priceline seem to think that it's my fault that I can't fit into a twin bed or that I didn't conduct their due diligence prior to my trip and have failed to take action on my behalf. I was offered a credit towards future visits, but, after this, I may never go back to Toronto, much less step foot in this place.",

The TV in our room was tiny and from the 90's. Our shower was so small it was difficult to even move around. I traveled with my parents to Toronto. The Jarvis House said they would be able to accomdoate three people with a sleeper sofa. However, they didn't even provide sheets for the sofa. We had to hunt through a closet to fetch a pillow and comforter. Who knows when the comforter or couch had been cleaned. All we were served for breakfast was eggs, bacon, and toast. This was well below my expectations for a B&B. We were supposed to stay here two nights, but ended up only staying one night.If you're looking for your classic B&B with helpful hosts, who share their home with you, this isn't it. This had much more of a business/hotel atmosphere. I would highly recommend paying more money for a nicer place, because the Jarvis House is well below par. This B&B should definitely be skipped!",

Yes this is an old house, but as an investment property, one must invest money back into the property to maintain and upgrade it.  This has not been done!  The minimum has been invested into this B&B!  Per the website (http://www.jarvishouse.com/)  they advertise their B&B as \"immaculate housekeeping\" and an \"immaculately maintained accommodations.\"  This couldn't be further from the truth!  I cannot see how other reviewers can recommend this or give it good reviews!!!  We reserved a \"GOLD STAY\" room, the most expensive room.  We arrived early and decided to leave our luggage in the room and explore the city.  As we entered room #11, the bedding was not on the the bed due to the staff preparing the room.  We observed very large stains on the mattress and the pillows were stained as well.  The host said she could remove these stains for us, but this begs the question...why haven't they been removed prior to our complaint!!!  Disgusting!  Please do not stay here unless dirty accommodations are what you're accustomed too!  The photos do not show what is at the heart of this B&B and after our complaint, the Youtube video link on their website has been taken down.  Curious to say the least, but you have been warned!",

If you're someone who only cares about simple, clean accommodations because you're going to be out and about all day -- and you're on a budget -- then I would definitely recommend this place. Location is good too. Public transit system in Toronto is really great, so you can get around anywhere no matter where you were staying. If you're looking for luxury, modern accommodations, you're going to have to fork up a bit more for that. Others on this site who are complaining about the place need to face the facts that it costs A LOT to maintain a high-end, modern upkeep of an old house in one of the most expensive cities in the world. They probably are hipsters who have never been in a third-world country and are used to the Hilton that mommy and daddy paid for, and have a false idea that all places are as such.

The food was fabulous and each item cost between $3.00 - $5.00, so no excuse not to try everything.The Victorian B & B is 140 years young.  The room itself was very clean and quiet.  Wi-Fi worked well..  You can reserve parking for $10.00 / day.Tip:  Bring your own hairdryer, shampoo, conditioner and lotion.  The Hostess, Erika is very hospitable and more than willing to please any request you may have.

      "text": "We spent four nights at Jarvis House on a recent summer getaway to Toronto.  The good:  Excellent location and unbeatable price (about $115 US per night, including parking, for a room with king bed and adjoining bathroom).  If you're okay climbing two steep, narrow stairways, Room 9 on the third floor was exceptionally quiet as it faces the back and does not share common walls with other guest rooms.  Now the bad:  This is NOT a hotel.  The only staff we ever saw was an inept young man sent over to let us in on a Saturday afternoon.  No maid service, of course, but a handwritten sign pinned to the bedsheet that serves as a door to the basement linen closet admonishes guests NOT to take extra bedding or towels.  It's also NOT a B&B.  Although some other commenters praised the morning coffee, there was no food service offered.  Your first vision upon entering is a filthy, stained carpet on the stairs.  Bring your own soap and shampoo.  The cheap plastic venetian blinds did little to keep out the morning sunshine.  The king bed was lumpy.  Wireless internet was sporadic.  So, if you're not too picky about accommodations, shopping for a bargain in central Toronto, and not planning to spend much time in your room, Jarvis House might be ideal, but we won't stay there again.",

There were not bathroom toiletries aside from a tiny bar of soap and very small bath towels.

Road noise in most of the night in the room at the front of the house and also very noisy in the from at the back of the house.

The air conditioner was still in the window and left a draft in the room...  The water took forever to heat up..  At least five minutes or more..  The decor was extremely dated as well..  Don't think it's been upgraded since 1965...  Because we were on the third floor, we had to haul our luggage up three flights of stairs, which was very inconvenient, not to mention tiring... There was no lighting in the staircase and it made it difficult to navigate around.. We were told that our towels and sheets would be changed on the third day..

      "text": "One of my worst experience ever.  The owner should have the permit revoked.  Don't believe the glowing descriptions on the website nor the pictures you see on line.  Place looks dilapidated from the outside, not welcoming at all.  Our taxi driver did not know where the place was and sort of frowned when he let us out..looking at the facade is a big turn off.  As we were about to walk up the steps a guy walked open the door and started to shake a dusty door mat.  \"Is this the welcoming mat?\"  I thought.  He nonchalantly let us in (I don't think he was a guest, but a tenant, no shirt, unkempt, and peering through his door his room appeared more like an apartment than a b&b room) and said, \"She'll be with you\".  A young Oriental woman, rather timid and obviously without any hospitality experience directed us to leave the luggage and descend a flight of stairs to the ground floor where we gave our credit card and transacted business.  A bill had been drawn that included a charge for parking.  Since we did not have a car, she corrected the information after calling someone and communicating in Mandarin (third red flag, by then we should have just walked out).  The business was transacted in the breakfast room, devoid of charm, with boxes of Cheerios and Cornflakes stacked on a shelf, along with a coffee pot and a toast.  I asked what breakfast consisted of and she said, \"egg, cereal, jam, butter, toast (only two choices:  wheat and white bread)\".  Up to Room 7..no soap or shampoo, a couple of card boards next to the malfunctioning AC to deflect the light from the lamp outside, a creaky bed, a carpet that smelled musty, lack of storage (only a night table with three very small drawers), a closet with only four hangers and a hide away bed which limited the available space for storage..no phone and a tiny bathroom with small shower.  I was disgusted and immediately started to make arrangements to check out..not an easy task on a Sunday evening, particularly during PRIDE week celebration (had I known about this, I would have cancelled which explains why I had a difficult time making reservations back in January).  When taking a shower, I could hardly turn in the stall and had to be careful about hitting my head in the shower caddy.  Slept poorly that night since the moldy smell in the air flared up my allergies.  Next AM during breakfast, the owner asked me how I had spent the night.  I told her about my allergies and she offered to give me another room until Thursday, then back Room 7.  The options were a room in the first floor, with a king size bed (what we originally requested, not the double bed in room 7) or a room on the third floor, long climb of stairs.  Either way, we had to vacate Thursday and move back to room 7..not an option.  Fortunately, I had made arrangements to move to a hotel nearby, forfeiting the remainder of my payment, but it was worth it...I would have been miserable.  Yes, she tried to accommodate me, but she should have been more forthcoming in her description and pictures.  I did not feel safe in the place.  Besides the individual we saw dusting the mat, there was another couple we briefly met for breakfast,  and that was it.   In retrospect,  I should have asked for a refund based on the false advertisement , but I was disgusted..the reservation was cleared about cancellation, but I know that everything is negotiable.  Caveat emptor...wish I had read the reviews on TripAdvisor...live and learn, a rather expensive lesson.  I have stayed in bed and breakfasts before and overall had pleasant experiences, but this is the pits..the only thing worse is a room I rented in Oaxaca for three nights back in 1984, when I was thirty years younger.

Climbing the winding staircase to the first floor the first thing you notice are the dirty scuffed walls in dire need of a fresh coat of paint, the second is the worn and stained carpet underfoot. The bedroom itself, while well furnished had issues of its own.  We stayed in a \"gold\" room, more specifically number 9 on the top floor at the back of the house and while the website touts that their windows are airtight thus noiseproof and Erika told us herself it was a quiet room we've found this to be anything but true.   Yes, there wasn't a sound to be heard from the rest of the house however no one told us about the next door neighbors who like to party on their upstairs patio. Loud voices and music kept us awake til 2-3 a.m on both friday and saturday night...in November.The bathroom has no counter space - though there is a shelf along the far wall in the the tub/shower.  The cold faucet needs fixing as there is no set stopping point to stop the flow of water.  Go too far back and it starts up again.   Also, none of the \"romantic lighting\" fixtures and outlets on the wall behind the bed work.  You'll have to find another place to plug in the alarm clock, any other gadgets or find reading light. While the room was spotless and the carpet and paint fresher here than in the common areas the horizontal blinds on the windows with their crooked or broken slats and a mechanism that won't lower them all the way down need replacing. Tucking away a second roll of toilet paper somewhere wouldn't be remiss either.  We ran out on the morning of our departure.   Thankfully we'd brought our own kleenex (a must since there's not a box to be found in the room either)  On the upside, the kind sized bed was extremely comfortable even if not the four poster bed of my dreams seen in the picture on their website.Breakfast has taken a hit since the last two times I've been here. I remember bacon and pancakes offered with the eggs in the little dining room tucked away downstairs, along with the make yourself toast and cereal.  This time around all we were offered were fruit and eggs.Though our host Erika was warm and welcoming and nothing beats the central location in the heart of downtown, a subway station two blocks away or the charm of Cabbagetown with all of its shops and restaurants, the next time we visit T.O we'll have to seriously question if all the other irritations make it a worthy trade-off, good price or not.",

My room was handsome and comfortable, and I enjoyed exploring the rich and colourful neighbourhood in which the house is located. The breakfast was simple and tasty, and Erika happily accommodated my dietary needs. I recommend the Jarvis House very highly.",

      "text": "It is hard for me to review this B&B as my husband 'didn't mind it', while I was very unhappy with my choice to stay at Jarvis House. The photos of the outside of the building are very misleading-the building glows in sunlight ,whereas in reality it is grey and drab. I had booked a certain room only to arrive and be given another room. While this room was at the back and quiet you had to walk through the bathroom to reach the very cramped bedrooom.The pillows were like rocks so I had no sleep in this 'quiet' room.We were charged $10.00 more than the rate quoted and were told that the extra fee was for parking.It would have been helpful to have had this knowledge beforehand so we would have been prepared NOT surprised by the charge. The down stairs dining area is accessed through the 'laundry' where you need to be careful not to trip over the mounds of waiting washing. Was there a plus at all? Well it is within walking distance of the shops and Downtown restaurants.",

      "text": "I have very mixed feelings about this place. We had a great deal of difficulty lining up budget accommodations in the placed featured in guide books (I had not understood before I arrived that what we celebrate as Columbus Day in the US is the Canadian Thanksgiving), so I took a chance on this place despite the unpleasant one-star review above.  My bottom line reaction is that this is a budget accommodation and, for a budget accommodation, it is OK although not great.  You have to know what you are getting into.Physically, this place is a bit faded. Narrow unpleasant corridors, unpainted sections on some walls, cracks in the sink.  The rooms vary greatly in size â€” we were told that the room we had reserved was small, and when we looked it was, but we were offered a much larger room and we took it. Our room itself was fine, the bed was comfortable, although the bathroom was poorly stocked with no shampoo (I always travel with some, just in case) and the bar of soap was minuscule.  The hotelâ€™s web site site advertised that even the front rooms facing Jarvis Street are noise-free because of the way the windows are made â€“ this was decidedly not the case, but the weekend noise at least did not bother us. Closing the bathroom window  helped on the noise frontThe room comes with a full breakfast, served in somewhat cramped room in the lower level â€“ the host makes eggs in the manner of a guestâ€™s choice, along with some fresh fruit and two strips of bacon.  There are also two kinds of bread that can be toasted, and cold cereal with milk.  Breakfast was a mixed bag like everything else â€“ if you use the toaster and the machine for heating water of tea at the same time, a fuse blows.  And on the second day of our stay the hotel ran out of milk (only half way through the breakfast period) and although our host said she could go out to get more milk it sounded as if it would take sometime, so we passed.  The computer provided for guests prints out in the hostâ€™s sitting area, and in any event the computer was unusable because the shelf that holds the keyboard and mouse was stuck inside the table; and the computer was so old that there was, apparently, no bus port of the front end.  But showing the other side of this place, the host then took the thumb drive onto which I had downloaded the PDF of my boarding pass the night before and went to her own home nearby to print it out.",

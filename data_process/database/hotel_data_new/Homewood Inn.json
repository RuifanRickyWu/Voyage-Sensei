      "text": "I took three teenagers to the Homewood Inn for a two night stay as their introduction to North America. The Homewood Inn proved to be good, basic accommodation, clean and with parking and air-con. However the two factors which raised it to 4 stars were its central location and the helpfulness of our hosts. On the first afternoon John sat me down and explained all the possible sights we could see in the city and gave them a ranking. This enabled us to make maximum use of what proved to be too short a time in Toronto. The location is close to Jarvis and not too far from buses and the subway system. This meant we didn't have to use our car for the time we stayed in the city.We had two spacious rooms on the ground floor, in the adjacent house. The rooms, and indeed the whole locale, had seen grander days but there were no problems and we all slept very comfortably. Breakfast was good wholesome food with pletny for everyone. And in the garden there were racoons and black (yes, black) squirrels for amusement.Would we stay there again? Yes, definitely and - providing you aren't looking for mundane 5 star accommodation - so should you!",

The blinds were broken, the room smelled, and there were no niceties like a box of Kleenex or drinking glasses. Luckily it wasn't cold, because the only extra blanket was a crocheted spread sitting at the bottom of the closet. The bedside table was dirty.The shared bathroom was clean, but rather run down. The kitchen was passable. Is this really a rooming house?On the plus side, Edie was very friendly and helpful with advice for restaurants (I recommend Just Thai on Church St.) and using the public transit. Breakfast was passable, although the sausages were cold.It sufficed for a one night get together with an old friend who wasn't choosy, but I'm glad I wasn't there longer and certainly I wouldn't stay there again.",

The rooms were clean, spacious and well furnished with all the modern amenities such as a TV, fridge-freezer and an air  conditioner too. There are also laundry facilities.Every morning we would enjoy a hearty breakfast, cooked and served individually and promptly. The Inn is also in a good location, being walking distance to two subway stops (which means it is pretty much connected to every part of the city). On the whole, this was an outstanding Bed and Breakfast, and one I am sure I will visit again on my next trip to the beautiful city of Toronto, ON, Canada!",

It's just so warm and cozy with the friendliness of the hostesses, Dolores and her daughter Eadie, and other guests. The rooms are clean and comfortable, and breakfast is enjoyable. In the summer one has the pleasure of sitting on the front porch in the early morning and evening with a good cup of coffee or a cool drink just like at home. These occasions can be quiet and relaxing or spent in amiable conversations with other friendly guests from all over the world. Downtown shopping and entertainment are a walk away, as are the subway lines for those who wish to go out more often. Hotels are too impersonal and lonely for me, along with being too expensive in comparison, so Homewood Inn is where I like to stay each year when I'm in town. Thank you Dolores and Eadie for your warm hospitality. And Eadie, I look forward to doing more crossword puzzles with you on the front porch next summer when I come back.",

I have been many B&B's in Britain and Europe and was surprised that the best is in my own country. Price extremely reasonable for downtown Toronto, close to all the facilities.

Homewood Inn seemed like a nice change of pace. The neighborhood is not bad, not great, but not bad. The location was great for our needs.  We were greeted by the owner and after a quick orientation were shown to our room. We opted for the private bath which meant a 3rd floor room. Now, I am all for charming but, this place needs some serious updating. We get to our room and I have to say it was much larger than I expected. The down side to that was, it was a very hot day and the AC unit could not cool the room enough. The bed was surprisingly comfortable. The couch was not at all comfortable. After a solid night's sleep, we went down for breakfast. Now this is not the first B&B I've been in so I had expectations. I was disappointed. When we got to the breakfast room we were offered cereal or oatmeal and had to ask if there were other options. Eggs (any style) were offered. We opted for over medium. Coffee and juice were available for the taking. The eggs  were done correctly and came with hash brown potatos the only problem was there were literally 6 pieces of hash browns. the woman who came into the dining room after us knew what to expect and asked for extra hash browns. She got 8 pieces. Check out was painless. Sooo, final evaluation: pluses: Good location, comfy bed, big room free parking. Minuses: worn out facility, lame breakfast, overall room comfort lacking. Would we stay here again? Probably not.",

Obviously an apartment passing as a B & B.  Not particulalry clean and very musty.  Shades that let in too much light at night, with  no curtains to block it.  Breakfast was OK, but if not a meat eater you found nothing to replace it.  The carnivores seemed happy with it, and it appeared the rooms in the other house were better.

They always call you by name and engage easily in conversations about whatever comes to mind. Apart from spacious and clean rooms and a very nice breakfast it is true to say that the intimacy and openness of the Homewood Inn makes this place unique. It is close to the inner city and the subway and if they call you a taxi to the airport you´ll get a flatrate. The prices start at $ 65 Canadian Dollars for a single room including breakfast and the price is a good one considering the efforts made to make you feel welcome and home.

The staff was not friendly - who the other reviewers had contact with, I really don't know! Bathrooms are all shared, breakfast nothing to write home about, our room was damp and cold, the street is a haven for prostitutes with cars circling the area without end - I certainly would NEVER stay there again.",

If your standards are pretty boring & low re a place to stay, this bed and breakfast is a good option for you in Toronto.",

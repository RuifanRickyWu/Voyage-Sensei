      "text": "I am a seasoned traveler and have stayed at hundreds of inns, motels, hotels and B&B's  throughout North America. Havinn B&B is, hands down, the best place to stay in Toronto. And surprisingly affordable, too.My travel companion and I stayed at the Havinn B&B just shy of two weeks over the summer. We had a wonderful stay and will book there again next summer. Innkeeper Gary and his Japanese wife Emiko could not have been more attentive to our needs. Our unlimited breakfast buffet featured fresh fruit, fruit juices, fresh brewed coffee, bagels, cream cheese, all types of pastries and warm home-made muffins (try the blueberry muffins; they're out of this world!). If a problem came up during our stay, Gary or Emiko attended to it pronto. For example, I wanted a fluffier pillow. The next day, Gary came back with a brand-new feather down pillow just for me. The location, within walking distance  to all the downtown places of interest, saved us lots of cab fare, too.A B&B is clean, friendly guest HOME, not some cookie-cutter chain motel or hotel.  During our stay, we got to know the other guests. Some of them were repeat customers. Everyone remarked upon the excellent value and warm family-style atmoshere. And don't forget the muffins!Thomas Wentworth, Ph.D.Upper Saddle River, N.J.07458",

      "text": "My friend and I arrived at Havinn B&B in Toronto on a Friday at 11:00pm (at the beginning of October), and found the key and directions to our room hidden in the place where we were told, as we were arriving late. When we got to our room, we found it to have only 1 double bed, instead of 2 twin beds, as requested. When you go somewhere, you expect to get what you asked for, right? So we called Havinn 3 times. No one answered the first 2 times, and the 3rd time, a man answered the phone, and I explained the situation to him. When he replied \"So you're calling me at 3 in the morning or whatever to tell me this?\", I was speechless and said \"It's 11pm\". And he said \"Hold on\" in a grumpy voice. After a few minutes, he came back and said the best he could do was give us an extra mattress to put on the floor, and that we could move to another room the next day and I said \"Ok, that's fine.\" He didn't say anything. And I said \"Thanks.\" and he hung up. That's not the kind of service you expect when you go to a bed & breakfast, motel or hotel. I wouldn't have minded staying there the whole weekend, even on the Friday with the mattress on the floor, but his rudeness was so intolerable that we couldn't stay there the whole weekend and didn't want to give them the business they didn't deserve. So we made some phone calls to try to find somewhere else to stay, after leaving a note to the owners of Havinn. It was really frustrating because a lot of places were fully booked because of the long weekend and many others were very expensive (since this was so last minute). This almost completely ruined our plans in Toronto. Havinn's location is close to downtown so no driving would've been required. We found a Super 8 in Toronto East (Scarborough), which was very nice, and ended up getting there at 1am.The next day, I received an e-mail from the woman that also owned the B&B apologizing for what had happened.As for the place, it looked ok. The location is good, it's close to the Dupont subway stop, near downtown.",

For about $65 Cdn I had a big room on the top floor with a futon sofa, king bed, lots of nice oak pieces, and a TV.  The breakfast (served on the second floor) includes yummy danish pastries, nice wholemeal breads, although a bizarre fact is that there is no milk for coffee, just a tiny thing of coffee cream.  Still, a minor complaint, and there is a fridge to keep your milk container in!  You can use the kitchen to cook in and there are two and a half bathrooms to serve six rooms.  So there's always somewhere free.  It's a bit like a hostel because they don't do your room up every day, but at this price whaddya want?  I've already recommended it and will again.",

We are happy we listened to the many positive reviews here! Anyhow, Gary and his lovely Japanese wife couldn't have been more kind and gracious. Very relaxing atmosphere, just like being at home. And the price was a steal. Shhhhh....  Comfortable room, clean shared bathroom.  Basic but very clean. I'm allergic to dust mold so I was very happy there are only bare wooden floors everywhere. My husband liked free WiFi internet.  They had free parking for our VW. That's a big moneysaver. We did get up early every morning and ate a big breakfast. The freshly ground coffee was so amazingly good. (I asked Gary where he buys it, and we bought 6 pounds of that coffee in Kensington market before we left) The home made muffins that Gary's wife bakes are much better than mine. ;-) Yogurt, bagels, cream cheese, fresh fruit and different teas. We were stuffed until late lunchtime! Toronto is a great city--friendly, safe, exciting. Havinn is very convenient to all the places of interest like Kensington market (fruit stands and fish markets and scads of restaurants... try the free cheese and homemade bread samples) , Chinatown, the big Museum, CN Tower, Korea town etc. Hubby and I walked almost everywhere, except we took the subway to the zoo. Best food ever in Chinatown. Also check out  Vietnamese restaurants and \"pho.\" It's a delicious soup that's a meal.  Well, if you like to visit Toronto and want a very homey place to stay for not much money, my husband and I say don't even think  about staying anywhere else!",

You'd expect at that price, that luxury would start to waiver ... but you'd be wrong.Upon arrival, I was greeted by Gary who's demeanor offered a very friendly and welcoming introduction to Canada.  I stayed in Room 1 on the ground floor.  Extremely large room, stylish decor which fit the building perfectly, a large comfortable queen bed and a 3-seater sofa next to the bay-window.  Each room also offers cable TV & wireless internet access, which is more than most Hotels in the city, never mind other B&B's!  I found the bathrooms to be clean and adequate in number - I think only once did I have to wait to use one.  There's a kitchen with the basic utilities, allowing you to cook your own food if you want to (I didn't bother, given the amount of places locally to eat out) and breakfast is served daily between 8am-10.30am.  One of the other things I loved about my stay here was how non-intrusive it was.  If you need any assistance during your stay, there's nearly always someone on-hand to help, but you'll only need to vacate the room for cleaning/linen change if you're staying longer than one week.In terms of location, it's ideally situated in a quaint leafy suburb, just north of the main Downtown areas.  Public transport is accessible at either end of the street, however I preferred to walk into the city every day.  It took me around 45 minutes to walk to the CN Tower - I'd guess 2.5 to 3 miles.  If you take the subway from Dupont, it's a matter of minutes.From start to finish, this is a 5-star B&B in my book.  Prior to staying here, I'd had 5 nights in the Days Inn Hotel in the heart of Downtown, and it's no small statement to say that Havinn was a far nicer place to stay...at half the price!  I really couldn't recommend this place enough - if you're planning to come to Toronto, then look no further.  You won't regret it.",

It is quite inexpensive place to stay which has all the essentials.The room that I got was very spacious. It had a bed, a comfy sofa, a coffee table, and a chair. The lighting was provided by three lamps. The minor inconvenience is that there is no switch by the door to control any of the lamps. There was also a bookcase with two full shelves of books, some of which are quite good. There was also a TV in a room, but I have never tried using it. There is wireless which works quite well.The Havinn itself is a bed and breakfast with six guest rooms: one of the first floor, three on the second floor, and two on the third floor. There are bathrooms on the second and third floor, but not on the first. In addition, there is an additional washroom on the second floor that does not have a shower, but has a sink and a toilet. It is a strange overlook on part of the owners that the there are no hooks for the clothes in the bathrooms.Breakfast is served daily from 8am to 10:30am in a spacious kitchen on the second floor. It includes orange juice, toasts (two different breads), jam, bananas, apples and other items that vary from day to day (such as danish). There is also coffee that I did not try. There is a creamer, but no milk, which is sad for someone  like me who starts off a day with a cup of milk. However, there is space in the fridge that you can use. As the kitchen lacks stove, you cannot make yourself eggs even if you wanted to. There are two microwaves though. The dishes and silverware are provided, but you have to wash them after yourselves. There are signs on the cupboard saying that there are paper dishes for those who do not want to dishwash, but the paper dishes are not actually there. Unless you are in a hurry, I recommend to take public transit from the Toronto airport to Havinn since it is by factor of 7 cheaper than the next cheapest option, which is only barely faster. It is all explained on Havinn website with two minor details which take some time to figure out.  First, the bus stop at the airport is not easy to locate, as there are no signs to it. Thankfully there is a helpdesk at airport, stuffed by helpful volunteers(!). Here is how. To reach the bus stop, leave through exit B (all the exits are lettered). Above the curb there are signs. Look for \"C12\" (it is in the middle of the street). That is where the bus 192 stops. The fare is 2.75 canadian dollars, and the driver has no change. The fare covers the transfer to the subway. The second detail is that the subway has two platforms. Neither of these platforms is marked, but the trains from both of the platforms go in the same direction, and you can take either of them.",

The rooms were really nice, clean, comfortable, peaceful and felt safe. The beds were huge, comfy, the rooms were nicely presented and Gary got us air conditioning hooked up when there was a heat wave. Breakfast was tasty and always plentiful. The area is very convenient for the subway and walking distance to a wealth of shops, cafes etc on Bloor St. Havinn later became fully booked and we had to stay elsewhere (College Backpackers Hostel) - the room was pretty much the same price but our stay was far inferior and it really brought home how good Havinn was! We went back to Havinn and instantly felt like we had returned to a home away from home. Gary was so helpful, genuinely kind and full of advice to help us get settled in the country. We couldn't recommend Havinn strongly enough - a definite choice for anyone looking for a nice place to stay in Toronto.",

      "text": "I have been to a few other B & B's before and they were great, but this place was disgusting.  When you walk in, it is very dark and creepy and there is no tasteful decoration at all.  It is in kind of a bad neighbourhood.  The host isn't overly friendly and when talking to him it is kind of awkward.  Our room had no sense of decoration what so ever.  There was a piece of food on the floor with hundreds of ants surrounded around this food (disgusting).  There were dirty towels in our closet.  We weren't given enough towels and only 1 washcloth for 2 people.  There is no air conditioning so it is very hot in there.  The bed didn't seem to be clean and had hair and bugs in it.  We had to share a bathroom with everyone else that wasn't clean and the only shampoo and soap were little bottles that look like they had taken from other hotels (that everyone was using).  The breakfast was not what you are supposed to get when staying at a B & B.  It had been sitting out in the dirty kitchen for hours and was only rotten fruit, hard cinnamon buns and danishes.  There was some peanut butter, nutella and jam sitting out still in their same containers from the store.  There was warm juice and you were asked to make your own pot of coffee.  The WORST part is that you were required to wash your own dishes.  That likely violates a health code.  I have stayed at other B & B's and paid the same price and it was way better than this place.  Overall, I was very unhappy and felt itchy when I left.",

      "text": "I really wanted to be fair and hesitated to write this because I know it will affect the business negatively.  However, something should be done - and a fair chance given for improvement.  I am accustomed to good hotels, so I tried to bring down my standards.  I took a room on the basis of location.  I had read the reviews, but decided to take a chance.  On arrival the entrance looked somewhat deserted, but ok.  Not really a friendly looking meeting place.  A bedroom was to the right.  I'm glad it wasn't mine!  The front door was self locking and there was a bell to notify the owner/manager.  The BandB gave a modest impression - a somewhat tired home, but acceptable.  The second floor washroom was clean and adequate, but some damaged areas in the tub were repaired in a light manner - nothing that would interfer with a shower!  A low budget for repairs was evident.  The kitchenette had two small tables and a fridge - not much to find in the cupboards.  Morning breakfast was quite adequate with bread, fresh baked rolls, cereal, coffee and tea.  I think there was orange juice. - No complaints.  My room was spacious.  On pulling down my covers I noticed a strand of dark hair, and an eyelash - possibly happened while the bed was made, but it made me wonder if someone had slept on the sheets.  I was forgiving.  The sheets are also tired, and need to be replaced.  I pulled out the pillows from the shams because they appeared to be much more firm.  The pillows that I removed from the pillow slips were very stained!  Not good.  How much does it cost to replace pillows once in a while!!!!  I recommend you do this!  I was not impressed.  The lamps and shades were dirty and so was the window sill.  Perhaps a little more cleaning could be expected when you have a business happening.  The mattress was adequate.  My suggestion is - a really good overall cleaning of the premises, get rid of those bed bugs that I didn't see (hope I didn't take them home with me!).  I feel badly for you.  Buy some new sheets and towels - since the old ones are very worn looking.  The towel that I got was not clean!!!  Someone may have used it to clean their shoes for all I know.  I didn't use it, and I didn't complain either!  Do yourselves a big favour and fix these things, otherwise business will not improve.  Once in a while, some inexpensive fresh flowers and a small chocolate bar on the bed would do wonders!!  I wish I could come to help out.  Overseas students may be accepting, but if you want different clientelle, ie. couples, retirees etc., I suggest you put aside your pride, open your wallet and do a little shopping - the returns will be well worth it!  Oh yes, and then advertise that you've made improvements - on this site!!!!  Someone who care for people who need to survive!Good luck.",

Clean bathrooms, clean and very comfortable beds, clean well kept kitchen, beautiful rooms.  The hosts Gary and Ekimo were friendly and nice.  It was like a hotel really except for sharing a bathroom and kitchen- the rooms are quite big.  In a nice part of town with old houses and trees.  Not too far to subway and bixi bikes and local crepe restaurant.  Very good value too, I think.  We will surely return!  Thanks for a great stay and delicious scones.  There is a place at the back to park your bike.  The floors are squeaky is my only complaint but that is what happens in an old house :)",

To be able to park the car on site and travel by foot and subway is so relaxing and stress free. So much of the city is near to Havinn - U. of Toronto, Bloor St. shopping, Chinatown, Casa Loma.  Do I mind a 100 year old Victorian home with high ceilings and spacious rooms? Do I mind some tiredness in the painted surfaces? Not so much when I consider that for my economical dollar I get a breakfast that will suit me for a morning. That for that dollar I will have the use of 3 no waiting washrooms to share with only a few other guests. And I have watched the Moodies clean their washrooms and I know as a professional home renovator and project manager that they take very great care in the cleanliness of their place. And, if there are problems, as they do everywhere happen, then the Moodies are immediate in response and concern. For myself,  I would rather have a stay in a warm, caring Victorian home. Tourists go to hotels but if you are a traveler and wish to experience Toronto as a traveler, then try the Havinn  experience.",

As someone has already mentioned the breakfast is nice ( I loved the brown, poppyseed bread they have :-) and it is good to be able to use fridge and microwave. Now few words about the rooms - yes they also did not clean my every day but I didn't mind as I had all my stuff all over the floor ;-) As long as they are cleaned at least once a week it's ok. So:Room 1 - just by the main entrance door on the first floor. I bet you can hear people coming in and going out.Room 2 - with 2 double beds on the 2nd floor, overlooking SpadinaRoom 3 - one double bed, on the 2nd floor (my favourite room) and even though it is also ovelooking Spadina it is quiet.Room 4  - also on the 2nd floor, one double bed, big room but next to the toilet, opposite bathroom and kitchen; so if you like to sleep long I don't think this room is ok because you can hear people in the morning fe. if they have a conversation while having breakfast.I had to change the rooms while I stayed there so that is how I a little bit about them ;-)I think there are 2 rooms on the 3rd floor but I can not say anything about them.I hope it was helpful and I hope you will enjoy your time in Toronto.",

We drove up to Toronto from Illinois for our son's wedding and were grateful to find a place like Havinn (so close to downtown) with free breakfast and speed wi-fi incl. Worry-free parking very cheap. For price and location (with lots of trees around but so near to downtown), you really can't beat this B&B. We saved plenty of money compared to the big downtown hotels and liked the homey family style atomsphere.   B&B just a block away from the TTC, but since we like short walks, we just set off down Spadina to the restaurants and shopping. Everything convenient to TTC subway and trolley cars; it's really crazy and unnecessary to use a car. There are many different eating places close by, but make sure you try the Chinese steamed and stuffed bowza (sp?) with a bowl of sweet and sour soup. It makes a real good  lunch.   Gary the innkeeper and his wife Emiko were very nice to us. I don't understand the negativity. Everything we asked for like extra towels and pillows, Gary provided. The breakfast was quite adequate. We enjoyed the self-serve and homey family style atmosphere. We slept well. We ate well. It was friendly and comfortable. We parked our big van right in the back yard. And the price for the week was a bargain.  If our second son ever gets married to Canadian from Toronto, we'll be back! LOL",

Much of the furniture is old (some of the handles were broken on the dresser in our room).  There is some chipped/peeling paint.  Breakfast (which is continental: fruit, yogurt, pastries, bread, tea, coffee, and juice) is not served to you, but is set out in the kitchenette for you to serve yourself.  (The kitchenette has no stove/oven, but does have a refrigerator, microwave, toaster, coffee machine, plug-in kettle, and dishes for you to use whenever you want, not just at breakfast time.)  Also, you are asked to remove your shoes at the door.If any of these things bother you, this is not the place for you.  But it's a clean, comfortable place to stay in a safe and convenient location (one block from the Dupont subway, a slightly longer walk from the Spadina subway), and the price was just right ($60 for one person, $76 for two people, including tax).  All in all, an excellent place for the budget-conscious tourist to stay in Toronto.",

(i recommend getting a weekly pass if staying in toronto for a number of days.  it works as a buspass to get onto buses and streetcars, and a quick swipe will get you on the subway.  i took the transit so much i definitely got my $35 worth.)the room itself was very roomy and the bed was nice and clean.  i even had a  little sitting area with a couch, a wingback chair and a coffeetable.  i stayed in the first floor room right by the entrance.  you definitely hear people come and go in the house so if you like peace and quiet i'd recommend the third floor rooms where there is much less traffic.  the wireless was working off and on in that room but when there was no signal in my room (which only happened twice in 7 days) i simply brought my laptop to the second floor to connect then went back down to my room.  the tv had satelite so there were lots of channels to choose from but the tv itself had no remote so whenever i wanted to turn it off and on i had to get out of bed.  the air condition was fairly noisy since i had it on full blast but it didn't phase me at all.the bathroom on the second floor was clean which was good since it was the busiest one.  on most days i had to go up to the third floor bathroom and shower there but it wasn't as clean.  the second floor bathroom was much better maintained.  there is also a half bathroom on the second floor which is also very clean.i found breakfast to be very decent.  fresh fruits everyday with baked goods.  there was a variety of breads for toast, different kinds everyday.  also, coffee, tea, juices, yogurt are available.  on sunday, my last day, there was this baked dish which i can only compare to a kind of bread pudding made with fruit and you could top it with what i think is a really thick, heavy creme fraiche.  it was heavenly.overall, i enjoyed my stay at the havinn.  for budget conscious travelers like myself, havinn is the place to stay.  gary, the owner, was very nice whenever i bumped into him.  he was very accomodating and very friendly.  i will definitely stay here again when i return to toronto.good job, gary, and keep up the good work!!",

      "text": "Short review:  The Havinn bathrooms are disgustingly dirty and Gary, the owner, is a complete jerk.Long review:I stayed at the Havinn with 4 other people, one of whom was disabled and could walk only with the help of crutches.  When we first got there it seemed ok.  We booked two rooms and my friend and I were planning to stay on the one on the first floor until we found out there was no bathroom there.  So we ended up having to take the 2nd floor room and let the rest of our group switch to the first so that she could access the bathroom easier.The first thing I noticed about this place was that the bathroom was DISGUSTING.  The entire 2nd floor bathroom with shower was moldy.  It looked like they hadn't done a proper cleaning in years.  The inside and outside of the shower curtain along with the grout on the tub and between the tiles were completely moldy.  You'd think from a place that requires you to take off your shoes before you enter, that they'd care about clean bathrooms.  That was wrong.Gary seemed nice at first but he turned out to be a complete jerk.  He made us pay in cash up front for our entire stay.  But after realizing my friend couldn't really access the shower, she went to him the next morning to explain the situation and ask for a refund so that we could find a place that was more accessible.  I heard him yelling at her from the first floor, taking no sympathy on her situation.  He was only concerned that he'd be stuck with an empty room.  The most he could do was offer to refund $15 for the next two nights and she could go find another place to stay by herself.  What complete BS.  I would NEVER EVER stay at this place again and I would NEVER recommend it to any one.And I learned one good lesson from all of this - never pay up front in cash for an entire stay.",

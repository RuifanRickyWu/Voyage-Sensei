Good food all around.The apartment was inviting, clean and organized, with basic household supplies all stocked up already. Couldn't be happier.I arrived later than expected the first night, but Nick and his wife were there to let me in, welcome me to town, and answer any questions that I had - even at that late hour. That first interaction speaks volumes for how nice they are as people.Will definitely be back the next time I'm in Toronto.",

The room pictures are lovely, but the construction is NOT finished and there are wires hanging out, venting not connected, furniture not put together properly. There is no hotel front or lobby, instead you pull up to a boarded-up building covered in graffiti with a paper hand written sign directing you to another door where you go up stairs and enter a dim room covered in boxes and papers. They photocopy your credit card and then walk you outside, around the block corner to a gravel path into an unfinished courtyard. The outside of the building looks to be falling off in spots, and there is insulation hanging out and backer -board everywhere. The room I was given was not the room I booked, and I cannot believe that this place has passed final building inspections. Despite purchasing a non-refundable room through Expedia, we refused to stay here. If you are staying for the PanAm games, PLEASE DO NOT BOOK AT THIS HOTEL even though the price appears good. It is wildly misrepresented on the booking sites, and is a hazard.",

Check in was a long and painful process.   The practice of photo copying your credit card and drivers licence is terrifying to me.   The area is a little sketchy.   The construction comments in previous posts still stand. I've added pictures of the moldy shower curtain,  the disgusting air return,  the ripped sheets,  the towel with holes in it and the counter top which just shows a lack of attention or disregard for detail. The bed was hard as a rock.   I like a firm mattress but this wasn't firm it was hard.   In reading one of the other reviews maybe it was just a box spring.

The day we arrived the address was advertised wrong so we couldn’t find the place and after calling 3 times the lady finally was able to tell us where it was. We entered the “hotel” through a coffee shop and had to wait an hour for the room to be ready. Then the lady had to take us through a sketchy gate to get to the room. This room had not one window. Toilet didn’t work and no hot water in shower. Bed was horrible and uncomfortable. There were hair and dust all over everything. There was a kitchenette which was nice. But it honestly felt like a jail cell. We only went to the room to sleep and found every way possible to avoid staying in there. No air conditioning and no room service. Not once were out toilet paper filled or bed made. We had to buy toilet paper cause there’s no phone in the room to call front desk(there is no front desk). This was a scary excuse for a hotel room. I have stayed at over a hundred hotels around the world. I’ve stayed at plenty in GTA but I’ve stayed at hotels in third world countries for a third of the price of this hotel and nothing, NOTHING compared to how terrible this place was.Do NOT stay here! I’ve never left a negative review for anything in my life. But this needed to be said. If you have a trip coming up planning to stay here, CANCEL it!! And Hotwire, shame on you for having this as a “hotel” option associated with the same level of quality as Sheraton and Delta Chelsea.",

It claimed to have baseboard heaters in the room, but that wasn't the case.You go into one storefront (no sign) to check in and then go down the street to a nondescript door that takes you to a little area with a long staircase. After climbing the stairs and found myself on the roof. there are also no 24hr person at the front desk its a sing on the door that say please call.. the parking is terrible they had me park in this lot which i got blocked in and they didn't know who car it was, when parking enforcement was called they gonna tell me that this lot is not register and there nothing they can do.. cut the long story short when i went to get my money back they was giving me the running round acting like they didnt know who the manager was, DONT STAY HERE!",

There is NO living room or den.. so if you want to relax and read, you either lie on one of the beds or sit on a hard kitchen chair. Bizarre. There is a large fridge (probably irrelevant for most people) but it blocks 1/2 the entrance to the bathroom. would make a good situation comedy set. The walls are in need of a new paint job. The bathroom fan sounds like a 747 taking off.. The walls are paper thin so you hear other 747s taking off.There are no face towels in the bathroom (HELLO>> THIS IS NOT EUROPE)They give you slivers of soap, the kind your parents used to get in all hotels.The shampoos are God knows what made with what...I didn't try the stove.. but the light didn't work....one bedroom had no table lamps and the other bedroom had only one. The beds were large enough and mostly comfortable which is nice.. There are windows to open but this room had central heating and cooling .. so you have to call the staff when you want to change the temperature...you can get cheap on-street parking, but you may have to walk a while to bet back to your apartment.",

      "text": "Booked a room to see a Blue Jay's ALCS game. Hotwire compared this place (2.5 star) to a Best Western, Holiday Inn Express, Clarion which we thought was reasonable. Don't be fooled! It is NOT comparable.Like a previous review, our room didn't have a view. We were up a flight of dirty stairs/hallway. Our room DID NOT have a window (is that even legal? Up to fire code?). It had a skylight that was about 15-20 feet up into the ceiling with no way of getting out if there was a fire. The worse part is that I didn't even think of this until the next morning...or I would of put up an argument.  The shower door was broken, couldn't open it without it falling over. The bathroom sink base of made of plywood. Tried to check in at 3:00pm but the room wasn't ready. When we came back after the game (8pm), we were given this room. With an exhausted 7 year old son and my mother who is a senior, I was at a loss. I had paid $125 for this room that was non-refundable and my other option was to lose $125 and try to book sold out or unaffordable rooms in other hotels, I felt stuck and we stayed the night. Once I contacted Hotwire (the next day), they told me that there wasn't much they could do to help me as I didn't call them at 8pm for help (didn't think they'd help me so didn't call). I really think they should not rate this place in the same category as the hotels named above in my review. It is false advertisement. If you are a mother traveling with a child/children or a single woman, do NOT rent a room here, you will NOT feel safe. Everything about it gave me the creeps. I am really hoping that Hotwire lowers the star rating on this place so that no one gets rolled a bad card like we did. If you happen to get this room from a Hotwire purchase and you feel unsafe in your room, call Hotwire, they say they are available 24 hrs/day and they have received a formal complaint from me so it shouldn't be a surprise to them. They have told me that they WOULD OF HELPED ME should I have called on the spot at 8pm. I'd love to hear from someone if to see if they actually would.",

It is not like renting a serviced apartment. It is a room, sparsely furnished (and badly too), with an air conditioning system that made a huge ruckus, no windows, and dim yellow light that made the place feel a little sleazy.Now if it was reasonably priced (I.e sub CAD 100, then I might have given it a better star rating, but for 150 CAD/night, I truly expected more.Pros : It was a bed. Roof. Toilet. Cons : Everything else. The check in was hard as I could barely find the place. The corridors are dark and dimly lit. The latch of the door was non-existent, an there was only a twist lock (being a lone female travelling, this did not make me feel secure)The blankets were thin. The air conditioning was 25 years old, yellowing and made a huge ruckus. No windows. Poorly furnished, everything was really old. Toiletries were cheap and terrible. Go in with your eyes open and you won't be too disappointed. If all you want is a place to stay, and you aren't going to spend any considerable time in your room, then this should be okay. But I think you will find a better located, nicer place on AirBnB for cheaper.",

In an effort to save time and for easy reading, let's do this bullet style:- Located down the street from low income housing (although the area seemed safe)- Room was FILTHY- Bed was broken.  When I sat on one side, the other side came up like a seesaw.  I almost fell to the ground.  They had to put a few pieces of wood on one side to prevent what could have been a horrible fall.- The mattress was the hardest thing I've ever slept on.  I don't think it had one spring inside it.- TV would not swivel.  As a result, you can't watch it while laying in bed.- The lobby is a very small office that you have to walk outside the building to get to.- One washcloth had dried blood on it.  Two other washcloths had what looked like pubic hair and other body fluids. 💩- No alarm clock- No telephone in room so I couldn't call the front desk.  Therefore, I had to walk back outside to reach them.- No cable (appx 5 channels worked)- Microwave and stove was old and dirty- Mold in bathroom crevices- Visible mold and dirt on shower curtain- Dirty baseboards- Sheets were stained as if they didn't use enough bleach- No carpet.  They came and mopped the floors while I was there at my request.  They used the same mop in the bathroom as they did in the bedroom.  Yuck.- I was constantly coughing there but when I would leave, I was fine.  Weird.Positive:- It appeared that renovations were being made in the \"office/lobby\" and hopefully will make its way to the rooms.  Unfortunately, this added no value to my experience.- Internet was fast- Most of the staff was friendly but this one lady.....not so much.  She had an attitude out this world.- They were attentive to my needsThe hotel definitely put a damper on my vacation.  Every time I was done sightseeing I dreaded coming back to the room.  I actually stayed out longer to avoid the somber feeling of returning there and in hopes of being so exhausted that I would just crash when I got there.  OSHA should definitely come to inspect this hotel for themselves.  I do not recommend it to anyone for reasons including health, safety and peace of mind.",

The hallways had garbage piled up all over the floor and it reeked. She opens the door to our room and it's filthy, the dust was unreal and there were no windows. We left. I called Hotwire and asked them, is this for real? This place was listed as a 3 star... There is no way in hell.I'm pretty disappointed with Hotwire for even listing a place like this one and promoting it on their site. Especially as a 3 star.We went back into the \"office\" and said we weren't going to stay. They did not want to give me my information back, and kept asking me what the problem was. We took the loss as this room was prepaid through Hotwire. Words of advice. Just don't do it.",

There was no running hot water for showers or washing hands. Staff were very rude. We couldn't sleep due to people in corridor were being loud, yelling and stomping about! There was tea bags but no kettle to make tea. Had to ask multiple times for a hair dryer, and was asked by staff if I \"really needed one\" the bed was like sleeping on concrete so hard and uncomfortable, also very squeaky when you moved on it!",

This \"hotel\" is not anywhere near a 3 star rating.In short - it looks like an old bachelor's apartment. Shower was disgusting, bed was hard as a rock, garbage in the hallway, stains on all the furniture. If you are absolutely desperate for a room in Toronto, you may take your chances here. At least there's a roof over your head...Plus side, the location is not too bad. Heart of the city.We would never stay here again.",

Under construction.. No signage... No one working 24 hours ... No clocks or phones in the room...no proper computer system.. Wrote my credit card info on a sheet & pre-authorized my cc for $100 ???? The bathroom smelled like stale smoke.  Not clean looking.  The sink had hair around it that was not mine.  The kitchen stove was dirty. I felt unsafe walking up to my room.  Could hear people outside all hours of the night.I went to check out and the front door was closed to return my key and there was someone there who stated they worked there so i handed my key to him.",

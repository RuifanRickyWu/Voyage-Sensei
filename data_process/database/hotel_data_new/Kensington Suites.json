      "text": "The Brunswick Suite was truly a home away from home. It was spacious, clean, and modernly furnished.  The location can't be beat being right next to the famed Kensington Market.  One could make breakfast in-suite (full kitchen sans dishwasher), seat 4-6 persons in the dining room for a takeout dinner, or try a different cuisine each day in the Market. Transportation (street car) was only 1-2 blocks away. We felt welcomed with all the small touches (filtered water and cold glasses in the fridge; plenty of towels in the bathroom). The rain head in the large glass shower was a treat. The large screen TV was a must for the hubby. We loved returning each evening to the comfort of this suite, and we would like to stay again.",

All rooms are very clean and well equipped for a comfortable stay whether you want to be indoors or out exploring.  Uber's arrive within minutes which is convenient if you need to travel further.  Everything one needs is within walking distance: food stores, pharmacies and walk-in clinics, LCBO/Beer store, so many restaurants and even clothing shops.  Very close to University of Toronto where one can walk the grounds and enjoy the beautiful old architecture.  My best experience so far for Toronto accommodation.",

And the location is GREAT -- right next to the incredible Bohemian collection of shops and restaurants called the Kensington Markets on one side, and College Avenue's diverse shops and restaurants on the other.  Will definitely stay here again on my next business trip to Toronto.",

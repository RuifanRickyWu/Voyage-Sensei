The Chinese owner has several buildings, he receives a lot of money every day, but he doesn't invest anything, he just gets rich without offering a good service. The place is deplorable, cramped, and uncomfortable. It is well located in Chinatown, close to Kensington market, but offers no other advantages. If you arrive late at night, there is no one there to wait for you.  The walls are made of cardboard, you can hear everything that happens in other rooms. Towels and sheets are not changed during the whole stay.",

      "text": "I booked this location for 3 nights. I have to say that I’m not entirely upset at this place but wanted to clarify what you will be getting if you book this place. Having said that, I would also say that I would book it again but this time at an appropriate price as for what I paid, it was grossly not worth that price. I realize the market effects pricing based on supply and demand but if you contrast what they charged,  you will see hotels of much better standing in the same pricing category. Unfortunately for me I probably would have chose one of them instead if they were available at my time of booking.I saw the listing on bookings.com. It like most sites has a listing description, amenties reviews etc. There is a revolving banner of several reviews of the location. When I was booking, I read a few of these ads and they looked generally pretty good. What I didn’t do (which I wished I had done) was to actually go into the reviews section. I made the booking as I was in a bit of a rush. Later on I actually checked the reviews and found them quite disconcerting.  The bad reviews totally outnumbered the good reviews at a ratio of 4:1 and that revolving banner of reviews I feel was deceptive (even though I awknowledge its my fault for not delving deeper).The place turned out to be decent but not great. I’d give it a 6/10. I will not go into the description as its accurate for the most part. The location however was outstanding. Two other things I took issue with: the pictures show a  shower and wash basin , the room had no wash basin, no mirror, no sink. Their expectation was that you use a lower tap in the shower or a mop sink in the hall as your wash basin. So if you wear contact lenses, or make up or want to shave you better bring your own mirror. The other thing that irked me was that they list that they include air conditioning. My room had no air conditioning. Luckily, it was cool at night in Toronto and the fan they supplied did the job (even though the blades were loaded with dust). I’m not sure if its bookings.coms fault or the site owner but I think they mislead in some cases. They did offer to change rooms if I wanted but the next day it was cooler so I decided not to uproot and change.  The cleanliness wasn’t bad but could’ve been better. The shower wasn’t that clean, the fridge had food remnants (just a few crumbs), the walls weren’t that clean. The floors were good and that’s possibly because they tell you to take off your shoes.",

Justin and Mai (spelling?) were very friendly and helpful about things in the local area. We did have a couple of students with a loud friend, but they packed up and took her elsewhere around 12 am, and apologized for the noise.Pro tip: I did hear some other guests complaining a good bit about having to take their shoes off indoors. Folks, if you don't want to take your shoes off at the door, then don't stay in a place that has that clearly posted as a house rule.

Even though he was chinese he could speak quite good english he was very friendly with us  check in was easy with no problems. Please note You will have to take your shoes off when entering easiest thing is to put them in a bag which they provide and carry them to your room. They do this to avoid floors getting dirty with mud and grime.Our room was in basement to get there go take the main hall  to the back of the house and there is a decent set of stairs to take you down to the basement rooms.We had clean towels in our room.There is also water at front entrance that you can purchase for a 1.00 in which they use the honor system to pay for it.Another thing to note is that there are cameras in the main parts of the hostel, main hall and downstairs hall front entrance.I think this is a great thing that means my security is being taken care of.I will tell you the powder rooms in basement and the ceilings are low so watch your head and there is 2 of them down there plus a main bathroom with sink and shower.There is also a fridge,microwave and laundry facilities to use if you need them but you do have to pay for the washer and dryer..The room s are very small but if all you are doing is sleeping then it will work fine.I did find the rooms and other areas to be very clean so not sure why everyone is complaining.They are trying to upgrade this place to make it more updated like the other properties they have so you will have to be patient.If you are a simple low maintenance person who wants a cheap no frills stay then this will work for you. Best restaurant nearby is the village idiot pub must go there.I just booked another room at one of their other properties for Dec as we need to be a bit closer to bus station and it will be my 2nd stay at the other location.I didn't have a problem there with the check in process either. These places are close to everything, good restaurants, the greyhound bus station within min of walking, Tim's great chinese food a win win for us.One other thing to mention you will be asked to pay a security deposit of $100.00. for damages etc.This is common practice for most hostels/ motels / hotels.",

Comfortable beds and a great location walking distance from many attractions (China Town, Kensington Market, Yonge St, Rogers Center, etc.) and surrounded by TTC public transportation.We got off to a shaky start at this place. The initial entry is pretty confusing there are several pieces of electronic equipment (doorbell/intercom, dual security cameras, and a pig-tail corded telephone that emerges from below the front door) all with accompanying instructional labels (in English and Chinese characters) directing you to,\"talk to us here.\" Advice: just keep ringing the doorbell until someone answers.Once you make it inside you must remove your shoes, and be prepared to haggle with the attendant. They initially told us that the room we had booked was already occupied, and that we would have to walk to a satellite location '5 minutes' away. DO NOT accept this outrageous proposition. After expressing discomfort, surprise, and intention to stay at another establishment if we were requires to go somewhere else, we were shown an available room (that appeared to be the same room we had seen pictured when originally booking online.Once you've worked out with them that you will be staying at the same address that you already made tour reservation at, don't be afraid to haggle for a lower price, they're willing to make a deal at this place.  Advice: ask to see the room before payment. You can use some of the room's bizarre characteristics to command a lower price. For example, the toilet in our room was so close to the opposite wall that you'd have a hard time fitting a paperback copy of \"Of Mice and Men\" between the wall and the lip of the lip of the bowl; sitting sideways was the only way to make it work. Also ask for toilet paper.After ironing out the terms this place turned out to be a really great launch/crash pad for visiting to city.

Everytime we passed the owner we were told it would be sorted soon. Then at 10.30pm we got  knock on the door saying they could not sort a TV for that room and we would have to move.

We arrived at Toronto Aiport and were picked up by one of the employees of the hostel.  En route, the driver pulled over on the highway and told us that we would have to stay in a different hostel, 30 minutes outside the city centre.  We had little option but to take it.The \"hostel\" was situated on the campus of York University, with no amenities nearby.   Upon entering the building, the smell nearly knocked us out!  Upstairs, the bedding was smelly and dirty and \"never changed\", according to the proprietor.  We insisted that he change the sheets and duvet.  Under the bed were empty cans and chip packets and a condom.  What a hole!In the other room, there were no towels and the second bed was a mattress on the floor.   The bathroom was filthy, with hairs everywhere.  When we finally got some \"clean\" towels and bed linen, they were filled  with pubic hairs.  There was also no Wifi connection. The next morning, the driver arrived to bring us to the original accommodation in downtown Toronto...i.e. the Toronto Travellers Hostel.  First he tried to persuade us to stay on the campus for the additional nights, but we refused.  Upon arrival at the Travellers Home, we were shown to our rooms, which were connected and shared one bathroom (we booked 2 bathrooms for 2 rooms).  The floor was covered with hair, the bathroom was filthy and mould was growing all across the ceiling.  The rubbish bins in the hall were unemptied and the smell was unbearable.  When we complained to the driver, he informed us that the owner was unavailable and refused to offer a discount on the price.  He eventually gave us a measly $19 off our bill.  We felt very pressurised to pay.  When we asked for a receipt, he promised to give us one but never returned with it once he got the cash.  At this stage, our situation was so unbearable, we decided we had enough and left.  A cab driver told us later that this is one of the most dangerous areas in the city, renowned for drug dealing.  Stay here at your own peril but be warned...it's really really bad!!",

      "text": "booked this place through Expedia (who are a joke btw do not recommend) for two nights for me and my son (we were in Toronto for an NBA game).We got there at 7pm - checked in (I prepaid on Expedia).First off, it doesn’t look anything like the images on Expedia. Windows are smashed, the whole placed is tagged with graffiti, a woman inside was screaming help me by herself in the hall. Another man opened his curtains and started filming us. Ugh.We quickly ran out because we were about to miss our game at 7:30.After the game, we go back and the lady who checked us in has our door padlocked and says I owe her the full amount. Which has been paid!Oh, my phone died at the game because I didn’t have time to charge it (our flight was delayed and it was a whole thing).So I said I’d grab my charger, charge my phone, and then I could clear the whole thing up and pay her whatever I owe her.She refused. I tried to reason with her but she wouldn’t budge. My kid’s phone is at 3%.I called the cops.She came outside where we were waiting and asks for the key. I said that I’d go with her to the room - where she will get me my stuff and I will return her key.She says no. We got into a big screaming match about it. She doesn’t have another key and is losing it about how I won’t give her the key. Our passports are in that room!! Along with literally everything I have with me, I didn’t even bring my credit card or ID to the game. We’d just got back to Canada from overseas. So I told her that the cops were coming. She ran off then. Just effed right off. Never came back.All of this is while I am with my son!Cops come hours later. It’s after 1am. They end up getting the police Sargent involved because it’s just us standing there with no employees telling this weird story. The sarg manages to find a different employee eventually, gets the door open, gives us my stuff, and drive us to our next place.Oh. In the cop car, I overheard, “Yeah I suspect this is the same lady that owns the other 5. The woman from that time, ya know?”Cop shows me a mugshot on his phone, “is this her?”It’s her.“Hey, I didn’t show you that, ok?”*nod* 🤷‍♂️",

      "text": "Undoubtedly the most unique place I have ever stayed at. The hotel as a whole was a very friendly place to be. We initially arrived to 588 Dundas (the room we payed for) and they told us that they had no room. So they sent us across Chinatown to 16 Willison drive. But for this I am thankful. 588 Dundas ave was the textbook definition of a dump and the clerk was an absolute dike. 16 Willison was definitely much more my speed and I’m glad that we got moved. In regard to the room itself there were countless selling points First off, The mouse traps set up definitely made me more secure about the rodent infestation. I was initially worried about the shower being too weak, but lucky for me it came through the faucet as well as the ceiling for all angles of coverage. The water did flood the bathroom, but let me tell you the flooding really did a number on the ant population. I also really appreciated the presence of pillows, sheets, and blankets. They may have been slick with oil but I wasn’t bothered by it. A huge perk of the room was listening to beating moth wings at night, the white noise put me right to sleep. I also found the room layout very curious, never have I ever ridden a toilet side saddle before or used a fridge as a trash can. Everything on the property was very clearly labeled. The number 16 painted on the outside at least a dozen times. If we needed to get to the front desk and the door was locked they provided 8 phone numbers to call.",

I've travelled a lot, and I've stayed on tons of funky smelling couches and in many a cat-urine-reeking-commune in my time. I consider myself somewhat seasoned when it comes to cheap / bad accommodations. Therefor I thought that the negative reviews on this page where exaggerated - possibly written by travelers of the more preppy variety..However, they are not. This place is dirty and smelly. Toilet, bath and bed in the same (small) room. At least in the room in which I was staying. It's one of those places where you try to avoid touching anything. Which is hard when you have to sleep there. This feels like a parody of a hotel. Or maybe the antichrist of accommodations, haha. Great location though",

A price which is outrageous considering I ended up sleeping in a room which was no bigger than a cupboard AND also was the fire escape for the building. The only thing this place has going for it is the location, which is in Chinatown, a ten minute walk to downtown Toronto. There was no tourist information available, and the noise all through the night was terrible, mostly with rowdy Chinese people arrivng at 2am to have a row with the 'hostel owners'. This seemed to happen every night. For one night its fine, if you're prepared to put up with it, but any longer I would pay the extra money!!!",

My only concern before arriving was the cleanliness of the site. I was pleased when we arrived that both the common areas and our room were very clean. The staff was friendly, but don‚Äôt expect the full service you would receive at a hotel. The pictures of the residence are fairly accurate except the ‚Äúfitness center‚Äù is just a room with a few machines‚Äî no weights. We heeded the warning of others and brought our own towels. The towels provided are similar to ones you would get at a gym‚Äî smaller and not soft. They provided toiletries, but did not refill them everyday. I suppose we could have asked for more, but we did not need any. They also do not have any hangers in the room, but there‚Äôs plenty of drawer and shelf space. The location was safe. We walked 15 minutes to St. Lawrence market and took the streetcar all around town. It‚Äôs not central, but it‚Äôs not in the outskirts either. We used the parking garage below the residences and refilled our ‚Äúmeter‚Äù through an app, so we did not have to run back before our time expired. There are several eateries nearby. The Middle Eastern place down the street was excellent and El Catrin in the Distillery District was fun and delicious. I would return to this accommodation on our next trip. A great value!",

Having a kitchenette was great but it was literally empty (no cutlery, plates or cups even - they provided little plastic throw-away cups only in the bathroom.  The place needed a thorough dusting and floors needed cleaning in the bathroom! The shower required one to dance around to get wet.

And a bathroom with only a shower (no bathtub).Everything was clean and we had a great view of downtown with the CN tower. There is a rooftop garden on top of the YMCA next door so you have a view of that as well which was pretty nice.I liked that the windows open and you can regulate the A/C in the room as well.All this for about half the price of staying downtown.We didn't have any problems with the locking system...all you gotta do is lock the deadbolt from the inside when you are in and hold the card in front of the lock to lock it from the outside when you leave...easy peasy.All the staff was very friendly and always there to help or call a cab etc. There is a little coffee shop right next door where you can have breakfast or lunch which was great.Also the hotel is one block from the historical distillery district which is totally worth checking out. We stole some time away from our busy schedule and went for breakfast there once.We also walked to the convention centre once, which took us about 30 min.So for an active person, it's no problem to walk everywhere...its still pretty close to downtown and you get to see things you normally wouldn't.

Each bedroom has a TV, dresser, desk with phone and open closet with shelving. The beds aren't huge, but my husband and I were comfortable. The common area in the room isn't large, but we pulled the small table out from the wall and were able to play board games with four people in the main area. The view from our room was great! The shower head was really short. My six-foot husband had to do squats to be able to wash his hair. There's a game room on the second floor we really enjoyed with foosball and a pool table. The people at the front were nice and helpful. My biggest complaint was the heat. It was only in the 70s while we were there, but the room would not cool down very much. I opened the window in the evening to try and help, and the window broke. They came and fixed it immediately and said it happened alot, but I didn't want to open it again after that.The location is great too. The Distillery District with lots of shops and food options is a short walk from the hotel and worth a visit. There are also a few restuarants in the other direction as well as a little market. If you have kids, there is a park with a splash pad just down the street as well. We will definately stay here again if we return to Toronto. For the price, this place can't be beat.",

I think this olace is foe those who have graduated from hostel life.It is a 20 minute walk to Union Station so not too far, but it isn't that close to any tube stations.There were switching the door locks to electronic when I was there so some issues with the cards not working.

      "text": "The price looks good in comparison with \"normal\" hotels. But for close to $100 per night, the serious drawbacks in facility and service quality make this a loser. Not all is bad: the Mini-market on the property is well-stocked with healthy \"microwave\" food options and other convenience items, if at expectedly high prices. But to eat, you'll need to buy utensils, plates, cups, paper towels, and other necessities - ZERO is provided in the room. It is STRIPPED BARE. The Subway sandwich outlet, also on the premises, makes the standard fare and is fast and convenient. That's pretty much where the \"positives\" end. The location is  an hour outside of the city center by public transportation. The facility is a college dorm, sold as hotel rooms during the summer. There is no housekeeping service. There are no phones, and no way to connect to the front desk, even in an emergency. You get one towel when you check in. No one picks up trash or brings fresh towels. While the rooms are clean, there is one infinitesimally small chip of soap provided - essentially, enough for one shower, and no one to bring you more. There is no heat - it is turned off for the duration, throughout the building, even the the rooms are exceptionally cold. I begged for more blankets - eventually, I was able to get more sheets instead: worthless. Meanwhile, full air conditioning is turned on throughout the hallways, making it nearly frigid. The televisions in the room do not work because they are disconnected (there is no cable connection for any channels at all). Worst, and the only truly inexcusable shortcoming, is that the staff is poorly trained, un-empowered and egregiously under supported. Not one person was able to take personal responsibility for the simplest of requests. In fact, the ONLY person who runs the front desk in the evening is egregiously slow in dealing with a long line of people waiting to check in. One could reasonably expect the young staff (possibly students) would have at least a chimpanzee's understanding of customer service, yet ultimately, the fault lies not so much with them but the with management, who collectively offer the worst possible \"teaching moment\" to their hapless, underpaid (if, indeed they are paid at all) employees.

This place is almost brand new and the services aren't what you get in a luxury hotel but neither is the price. I paid $120 CDN+tax per night!!!King streetcar is 100m away will take you to all the action, runs frequentlyThe room was actually a 2 bedroom (student residence) apartment with a kitchen with no utensils of any kind ( Wise to get some plastic knives forks and spoons ) but if you're a pair of girls or guys save big by sharing with your own bedroom w/desk phone plenty of storage and a nice widescreenlearn how to use the A/C it's a bit confusinggood for families on a budget.Clean as a whistle and great views from my 9th floor apt I highly recommend this place",

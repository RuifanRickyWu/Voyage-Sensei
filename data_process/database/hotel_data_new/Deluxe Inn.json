      "text": "Flight from Toronto to Minneapolis was canceled, rescheduled for the next day. Normally airline would have hotel rooms on standby but a convention in Toronto caused room shortage. This room at Deluxe Inn with two Q beds was available for $117 CAD including tax. Our party of four adults arrived about 23:00, stayed until 6:45 the next day. Air very stale in this N/S room and smelled like scented spray, but did not smell of cigarette. Air conditioner worked and helped with staleness but very loud. Silverfish and spiders in bathroom and mold/mildew on bathroom ceiling. Water ran very slowly out the tub drain and pooled around ankles while showering. Entire room didn't feel very clean or well appointed. Sheets on bed came untucked easily exposing mattress pads, but we did get about 4 hours sleep. Beds reasonably comfortable. Entered the room through a door from the outside like a motel. It appeared there may be permanent residents living in hotel who entered through a small vestibule with stairs leading up from the inside 'lobby' area which was separated from the 'front desk' by a locked sliding barred wall that the front desk person slid back when we received our key. This person was cordial enough but not overly friendly or welcoming. The barred wall was retracted in the morning when we returned the key, so perhaps it is for night-time security. All in all, would never have chosen to stay here but it was better than sleeping in the airport terminal and we were glad to have it.",

We had a Jacuzzi in the room along with an sauna.  There were also mirrors all around even on ceiling. The sauna had not been cleaned from   previous guests, dirty towels and glasses left in sauna.  No way I was using either of these. Did not put us in a romantic mood at all.  When we checked out, my husband told the receptionist about the odor.

She seen the bugs and started freaking she wanted to go home, I called the front desk to ask for another room and the manager said he had no rooms, mind you it was 6pm on a Monday so I'm sure the place was pretty empty, he told me that he would come and spray the room but we had to leave for 15 mins. Wtf!!! I couldn't believe that, he sai they have no problems at all here and maybe the bugs came from the cleaning lady's leaving the door open. He would not switch our room, I will never come to this place again and would recommend that anyone else come here either. I even took pictures of the ants to show him and nothing was done about this. I am so disgusted I will never ever come back here, it's a rip off.

      "text": "I originally reserved this hotel through booking.com, as it had free cancellation and pay at hotel upon arrival, I choose here because it had easy access to Sherway Gardens mall and surrounding shops & it was close to downtown Toronto and the Islington Subway, perfect for me to keep myself occupied while my partner was out working during the day. Check-in wasn't the best i've ever experienced, as the hotel had actually cancelled my booking before we got there, it wasn't until after we had checked in, that i had realised this, as i received about 10 emails whilst in the air from booking.com saying they had tried to take money from my account, when it was a pay upon arrival, which made me unhappy to start with and i have never had that problem before. When we first walked into the room it didn't smell nice,  it was a decent size,one of the wall lights above the tv didn't work, The only good thing was the heater was pretty good and packed out a lot of heat very quickly, which was great when it snowed for two days and became very cold but it did have a smell to it at times. There was a fridge and microwave in the room which we used and they were fine but there wasn't any hot drink facilities in the room but luckily there was a  Timmie's right across the street. The room was clean so was the bathroom, the cleaners came in nearly everyday but sometimes not till late afternoon 3-4pm, also the walls are thin, we could hear everything in neighboring rooms, there was also a smell of weed coming from the opposite rooms at times, we noticed this whilst heading out in the evenings. The hotel is also between a burger king and a lorry loading facility, we were on the side off the lorry loading facility and would quite often be woken early in the morning by this.   The bed was clean and quite comfortable but they only supply two pillows which were not that good, so we had to buy an extra one from Walmart as they didn't have extras.The free wifi was pretty poor, it would often kick us out or we couldn't have more than one laptop or phone connected at a time or it wouldn't work and when it did it was very slow. There was only three plug sockets in the room and the ones they had weren't easily accessible and were also loose on the wall. we did have an alarm clock that i later found two days before we checked out, it had fallen down the back of the bedside cabinet. If it wasn't for the fact we didn't have a big budget and it was well located, we probably would have moved elsewhere, also if you have a car you might have trouble parking especially friday and saturday nights, if your on a tight budget it is somewhere to stay but if you can afford a bit more i'd go for Motel 6 on Argentia Rd, Mississauga.",

I have frequently been a hostel traveler, but didn't want to be around so many strangers for such a short amount of time. I was able to get a very reasonably priced room at Deluxe, which is just fifteen minutes from the airport by car. It is also on a big road called The Queensway, which has a few bus routes. Most of the hotel smells like stale smoke. This is inevitable for any hotel that allows smoking anywhere. It gets in and on everything. This was also true for the air conditioner. However, if you can deal with that (I can), the bed was comfy enough, the shower was strong and hot, the wifi was quick and, really, you can't beat the price. They seem to be doing some nice upgrades, including washable remotes for the tv and a newly reno'd lobby. Be aware that most of the rooms are upstairs and I did not see an elevator. I did appreciate the fridge and microwave, and found everything to be sufficiently clean and comfortable. If I am traveling through Toronto on a budget again, I would stay here again.",

The room is a bit on the small side but honestly the beds were way more comfortable than the Airport Travelodge or the Punta Cana Princess in the Dominican Republic. The room is equipped with and air conditioner, microwave and fridge ( even freakin duvets1). The Inn is convienient to the hospital. We thought of trying another \"budget\" hotel on The Queensway but slid by when after we pulled in and took a gander at the sqaulid offerings. Honestly, this place is a real bang for your buck in Toronto on a budget. Close to Tim Hortons (across the road!) With stores, restraunts, fast food and buses just outside the door. I am having surgery at St. Joesphs Health center and will have to be in Toronto for a few days. I would not think of booking any place else. I never saw a bug or a germ or mold of any kind. The rooms may smel a bit musty at first but turn on the air or the heat which is more than sfficient and the odor will go away. The room may have been cosed up for a few days. We will be back and soon. Thank-you for giving us an affordable option while in Toronto Deluxe Inn!!!",

      "text": "Let me start off by saying I was a store manager for a fortune 500 company in Pittsburgh Pennsylvania.  My complaint and experience is this, had stayed here total of 3 separate weeks. First week was great accommodations for the room are fair, second week toilet had non matching nor fitting tank lid, sink stopper non working, internet randomly stops working at odd times.  Most of all went down to reception on Saturday the 26th and spoke with front desk personal.  Extended our stay till thursday the 31st as when my husband is flying back to the UK.  I was very clear as check out on the 31st as again that was the day of his flight.  This morning on the Wednesday October 30th were rung by front desk stating the room wasnt paid for the 30th to 31st.  Went down there and talked to front desk personal and the Manager/owner was also present. They then proceeded to state that the room wasnt paid for, then we explained that had extended till the 31st as thats the day he is flying out.  Went into a slightly heated debate over this.  As being in customer service, they need to understand within reason that the customer is always right.  Why would I book till the 30th to have to move to another hotel for one night!  The oddassity to call me a liar to my face as a paying customer is very repulsive. The room is decent but if you want to be treated as a human being I would steer clear of this establisment.  He needs to go back to business school to learn how to run a business and apparently some manners would be nice as well. On top of all of this their rate changes from weekdays (87CAD) to weekends(95) as all hotels/motels, but when we explained the situation, said to his front desk worker to take 20 dollars off of 120?????  So in short jack up the price to 120 then take off 20 to still make more even thought it was their own clerical error.  When in customer service it is common practice to own up to your mistake and take care of the customer within reasonable parameters.  Not to call the front desk worker while she was in College class and ask her side of the story.  Not to jack up price to make someone think theyre going to get a deatl when it was their own error. Not to be rude and through hate speach and slander about a gay couple. Worst mamagement and etsablishment.",

We asked for extra towels and the staff was friendly and readily handed us extra towels for our use. Beds were comfortable in my opinion, and it was agreed on by the rest of my group. 15-20 mins to Rogers centre by car when traffic is good. 2 mins or less to Gardiner expressway and Hwy 427.You can find a Cora's and a Tim Horton's across the street, and a Burger King right beside the hotel. There are other restaurants within walking distance from the hotel as well.We are not picky when travelling, but I will admit I had misgivings at 1st. Now, I would definitively stay there again if on a budget, and just need a quick place to sleep with no frills.",

The lady at the front desk in the morning is really helpful and nice - she was able to hold my suitcase for the day (which they don't normally do).  If you don't have a car, the bus can take an hour to get to the city center but a cab can get you there in about 20 minutes with traffic.  My view was of a building very close next door.  I do not think I could stay there for a week, but for a night or two, it was okay - and really good considering the price.",

They probably have changed the furniture but the location of the breakfast area, the lobby and the small store was still the same. The rooms has definitely been renovated with the standard Courtyard coloured wallpaper and new carpets. Courtyard definitely has one of the bigger hotel rooms in downtown Toronto.The rooms are equipped with an iron/ironing board, a small refrigerator and safe a huge TV and the bathroom amenities are already in wall mounted dispensers.Their breakfast is quite extensive with 4 choices of meals and they are reasonably priced.As Marriot Goldcard members we were given a welcome bag which contained a bottle of water,a can of Perrier water and Pretzels.There was a slight problem when we reached our room and the room card was not working. They said it was a programming error with the room so someone came up to re program our door.The location of this hotel right smack in Yonge Street in Downtown Toronto is its major advantage with easy access to the subway and walking distance to Eaton Centre.",

      "text": "We had a wonderful, pleasant, enjoyable 6 nights stay at this hotel from August 21-27, 2021. After I booked our stay in June, I had a few concerns. Each time I called the hotel, I heard a pleasant voice and addressing me by my last name. The hotel has a good security system that is, you need to swipe your room key to get in to the hotel. The room that we got was located in the south wing, on the eighth floor, a bit close to the elevator. (North wing was not opened) Sometimes, I could hear noises. Talking about the elevators. There were three and a \"working\" elevator. It seemed to us that the middle elevator of the three, was the one that \"worked\" the most and sometimes made squeaky sounds. During one of the days that we were there, this elevator was under maintenance!  Room itself was clean, and spacious enough with many amenities except a microwave. As it's still under the pandemic, front desk staff did tell me when we checked in that the hotel's policy is to do housekeeping every 3rd day. We chose not to have housekeeping as we felt this was safer. Every evening when we came back, we would ask front desk for more towels, tea/coffee, etc. Sometimes, we got them in plastic bags and other times, we got them sent to the room. As our flight back to Vancouver, BC, was in the evening at 10:15pm, the hotel granted us a late check out at 2pm with free luggage storage. If we wished to keep the room till around 6/7pm, we'd have to pay C$100. After check out, we sat in the lobby till it was time to go to the airport. When we had to go out to buy drinks, upon returning to the hotel, we didn't have a room key to swipe, we could push the button and the front desk would open the door. During our 13 days in Ontario, we'd stayed in 5 different hotels, and this is the second best hotel. This hotel is highly recommended by us because the location is perfect, close to College subway, and walking distance to many places. Staff are extremely friendly and polite, very professional.",

The lady who checked me in made no mention of my platinum status. When I asked her for breakfast for my platinum amenity, she indicated they don’t offer a breakfast at this property?  For the first time in over 2 years, I didn’t get a room upgrade. Not a huge deal because I was only in the room for 8 hours, but when you get accustomed to certain corporate standards, you definitely notice when they fail to deliver. The room itself was dark and the bathroom had paint peeling off the ceiling. Very underwhelming. Valet parking was $45 day.  The bed was comfortable and it was nice to have a couple pillows with a little more substance.  The location is convenient to College Park, but there is construction going on just north of the hotel and the noise began around 6:30 am. Overall, I regret not staying at the Sheraton Centre. It is a little further away, but acknowledges their platinum guests and has a nice Club Lounge.",

      "text": "I'm always suspicious when I see hotels that have their carpets and walls decorated in the colors of dirt. When dirt blends in with the carpet it's less noticeable. That is, unless you take a closer look.The location of this hotel is convenient for our purposes, so we booked it for 7 nights. The experience at the helpdesk was rater vapid, nothing out of the ordinary. The staff wasn't rude, but wasn't friendly either, just all business. That was the tone of our entire stay. The rooms are cleaned every other day, with minimum or no attention to details, poorly made beds, just surface-level cleaning. They keep things clean enough, but not spotless. Seems like they also clean the hallways every other day. I saw leftover food from another room in the hallway floor for 2 days. I took a picture of it and went to the front desk to tell them to please remove it.The hotel is located in the downtown area, so it's not their fault that there is noise outside; they have no control over what happens outside their property. However, they are in complete control over how they keep their facilities and how they address their guests, which is why I am giving this review. The facilities are not necessarily run down, but they are kept to a minimum. You can see dirt accumulated in common areas and in the room. The elevators are barely functional, and we spotted a mouse or two in the lobby area.As much as I want to be understanding that the global pandemic greatly impacted the hospitality industry, and as much as I understand that sometimes business need to cut corners to stay afloat, this is different. Dirt, barely functional facilities and mice take this hotel to a place of neglect, not just survival.",

Although clearly an older property, my South Tower room was pleasantly decorated and a decent size, with a huge flat-screen TV and drip coffee maker. The bathroom layout was a little strange, with the wash basin completely separate from the bath and toilet, in a separate area with the closet. I didn’t have any issues with noise and I found the room heating/cooling responsive and easy to control.Breakfast was from a menu in the Bistro café on lobby level. Service was friendly and the food fresh and tasty. Starbucks coffee was excellent. The restaurant was only operational for breakfast but some drinks and light snacks (including home-made sandwiches) could be purchased at other times, day and night.I appreciated the complimentary laundry facility, which had large professional standard washers and dryers available, and even free washing liquid provided.The staff I interacted with were all extremely friendly and helpful. They made me feel very welcome and ensured a pleasant stay. I would particularly recognise Pauline from the house-keeping team, who kept my room spotless and well stocked.As Bonvoy Gold I was given a bag of complimentary snacks at check in, but no room upgrade was offered.This is not a luxury hotel, but a comfortable and friendly base for visitors to Toronto.

The rooms were very clean however there was a bit of a musty odour but that may be because it hasn't been used much during the pandemic. The staff were excellent and accommodating.

These would have made the stay even more enjoyable. I understand there used to be a pool pre-COVID but this was closed and not reopened.

A superb place for a traditional Canadian breakfast.The hotel is mid-market with all the usual facilities needed. Very nice, good-sized room for a central city hotel with everything spotlessly clean.So why not five stars?Just a couple of small issues:The breakfast selection is limited as the food area is more of a cafe than a full service restaurant (we didn't try dinner so unable to review)The bathroom in the bedroom was split into two.  One room had toilet, bath and shower while the sink was in a separate open area on the other side of the room. Very strange as this means that every time you use the bathroom you then have to walk across the bedroom (turn on the light over the sink if at night) to wash your hands etc.  Inconvenient and disturbing for your partner if the bathroom is needed during the night!But overall an enjoyable stay :)",

      "text": "This hotel is incredibly frustrating, I have told countless colleagues and friends about the incredible restaurant on premise, both food and especially the team (I have told them countless times the restaurant is higher than the hotel.  The hotel is older, and I can forgive worn furniture and rugs, but I cannot ignore rudeness.  I have stayed there on every stay in Toronto since October of 2022, i have very specific health needs because of leg issues, I have asked them specifically for additional items in the room verbally and through their app.  I always am assured i will get what I need, but rarely do.  In addition to this, on my last stay, I was having breakfast at 745AM (I needed to return to my room by 8 for a work call) there was an event going on that weekend in Toronto and the hotel created an odd policy of wearing a wristband.  They are welcome to do whatever they want, however, since I was checking out after my call I didn’t see a need to put that wrist band on for 15 minutes, these types of bands will irritate my skin within minutes.  I told their assistant manager that I was only going to be in the restaurant for 15 minutes then checking out in an hour, he insisted (stared me down) that I “must put the band on”, I explained I would be leaving in a hour or so and he wouldn’t give it up.  I asked for my food to go and ate in my room.  I watched him bully other guests (while they had food in their mouth) to put their band on.  Again, whatever policy they have is their business, and if a guest doesn’t like it they can stay somewhere else.  I, however do not need to be harassed while trying to have a quick breakfast and checking out within an hour to put the band on.  I told the front desk assistant manager that I needed a note from a senior manager as to whether or not they want me to stay at their hotel and if they would be able to support my needs, all I received was a note from the same assistant front desk manager.  I have since canceled two reservations and am staying elsewhere in Toronto.  If the hotel GM can’t find time in their day to send a quick email to a lifetime Titanium guest with ongoing issues, then i can understand why the service levels are so low.",

The design of the room was so tortured it should be left as an overnight for the manager.  The worst thing was the bathroom door.  It was a small barn door on rollers that did not work.  My esposa was trapped in the bathroom had I not been there to wrestle the thing open.  I put the door rollers back on the bar, yet the same thing happened to me.  I managed to squeeze thru the 6\" I was able to push/pull it open.  Large gaps between the door and the walls insure not a lot of privacy.  On top of all that the room was almost double the cost of the Doubletree I moved to after one night.  By contrast, the Doubletree is a beautiful room, much more luxurious bedding and pillows and furnishings.  And best of all a normal bathroom door !!

On our return from our evening meal the tap was still leaking and water had been spilled in the main bedroom carpet. We had to change rooms as a result. Receptionist was very good in accomodating the move",

Sink was in the room and not in main bathroom, so maybe this room type better for one person (not sure what they called it) especially if one person wanted to sleep in.  Staff friendly, nice lobby area.  didnt eat at hotel.",

      "text": "This hotel is incredibly frustrating, I have told countless colleagues and friends about the incredible restaurant on premise, both food and especially the team (I have told them countless times the restaurant is higher than the hotel.  The hotel is older, and I can forgive worn furniture and rugs, but I cannot ignore rudeness.  I have stayed there on every stay in Toronto since October of 2022, i have very specific health needs because of leg issues, I have asked them specifically for additional items in the room verbally and through their app.  I always am assured i will get what I need, but rarely do.  In addition to this, on my last stay, I was having breakfast at 745AM (I needed to return to my room by 8 for a work call) there was an event going on that weekend in Toronto and the hotel created an odd policy of wearing a wristband.  They are welcome to do whatever they want, however, since I was checking out after my call I didn’t see a need to put that wrist band on for 15 minutes, these types of bands will irritate my skin within minutes.  I told their assistant manager that I was only going to be in the restaurant for 15 minutes then checking out in an hour, he insisted (stared me down) that I “must put the band on”, I explained I would be leaving in a hour or so and he wouldn’t give it up.  I asked for my food to go and ate in my room.  I watched him bully other guests (while they had food in their mouth) to put their band on.  Again, whatever policy they have is their business, and if a guest doesn’t like it they can stay somewhere else.  I, however do not need to be harassed while trying to have a quick breakfast and checking out within an hour to put the band on.  I told the front desk assistant manager that I needed a note from a senior manager as to whether or not they want me to stay at their hotel and if they would be able to support my needs, all I received was a note from the same assistant front desk manager.  I have since canceled two reservations and am staying elsewhere in Toronto.  If the hotel GM can’t find time in their day to send a quick email to a lifetime Titanium guest with ongoing issues, then i can understand why the service levels are so low.",

      "text": "I stayed at this location as I wanted to see some of Toronto before heading to another Marriott property near airport.The start of the trip was challenging as I had a flat tire with the rental car.  A few hours after arriving in Toronto I had made it to the CY.  I wasn't sure where the parking was so I had called the hotel and Anurag stayed on the phone with me till I arrived in front of the entrance.  I was fortunate that he kept one of the parking spaces for me!  As a single female traveling, it was very much appreciated to have parking on location.  Saturday night it was full and by Sunday afternoon, not many using the garage.Upon arriving, he gave me a snack bag, which was another treat!   I was famished sitting on the highway, waiting for emergency services!   I asked for dining recommendations that were walking distance and he provided me Hair of the Dog!  Delicious!!The room (#1118) faced an apartment building but not a big deal to me.  The couple nights I was there, the room worked for me.",

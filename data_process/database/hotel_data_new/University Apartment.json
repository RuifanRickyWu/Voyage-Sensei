      "text": "Hostel review:Poor Customer Service: Waiting 45 minutes for someone to show up after repeatedly ringing the doorbell and calling is unacceptable. It shows a lack of responsibility and care towards guests.Misleading Description: The hostel's details provided on Expedia are misleading, indicating a significant discrepancy between what was advertised and the actual state of the place.Hygiene Issues: Bugs infesting the premises, lack of doors in the washroom, and a pervasive bad smell throughout the hallways and rooms are clear indicators of poor hygiene standards.Maintenance Problems: Rust inside the sink and shower, with dripping rust, demonstrate neglect in maintaining basic facilities, which poses health risks to guests.Security Concerns: The presence of homeless people around the property, coupled with the requirement for photo ID, raises safety and security concerns. Feeling uncomfortable providing personal details, especially to sketchy individuals, is understandable and alarming.Ineffective Resolution: Spending over an hour trying to resolve the issue with Expedia and the hostel, coupled with the extended wait time for assistance, highlights a lack of efficiency and professionalism in managing guest concerns.Overall, the combination of poor customer service, misleading descriptions, hygiene and maintenance issues, security concerns, and ineffective resolution processes makes this hostel a highly undesirable place to stay. It's concerning that Expedia would list and promote such a substandard accommodation option.",

      "text": "Being Asian and traveling with my grandfather who recently came from China, I thought this motel was great since it was conveniently located close to Chinatown. Little did I know, I was in for a nasty surprise. Nobody would answer the front door for more than 10 minutes, and when they did, they charged me $5 for checking in late. I told them I arrived in time but they didn‚Äôt open the door, and they told me it wasn‚Äôt their problem. They said they wouldn‚Äôt give me the key unless I gave them $5. I was already in a bad mood when they yelled at my family to take off our shoes when going up the narrow steep stairs. I told them to let my grandfather to keep on his shoes as he had problems walking and they told us that they don‚Äôt care and that we had to take them off or we‚Äôd be charged even more. I told them fine and I heard one of the staff whisper ‚Äúwhat a bunch of idiots‚Äù under their breath in Chinese. I let that go and did as we were told and got to our room and found out the floors were dirty and wet, the air conditioner was small and weak, and the beds were hard and creaky. We went to get the cheap foldable chairs and they collapsed when we tried to sit in them. Guess we‚Äôll be charged for that later. The bed was hot and almost impossible to sleep in without sweating. Then, while I was charging my phone the power went out several times. Then in the morning it went out again and never turned back on. I called them and when they finally answered, they said they‚Äôd be here right away to check it out. An hour of waiting later, nothing. When we went to return the key they didn‚Äôt have anyone there, and we called them and they never answered, even after I tried several times. I waited for them for an hour or so and they finally came, then fined us for checking out too late. I was extremely angry and told them all my complaints and that I wouldn‚Äôt pay the fine, and they tried to PHYSICALLY GRAB MY WALLET TO PAY THE FINE. Whatever you do, do not stay here.",

The room was extremely small with just a bed, a closet, and a window with a fist punched through it. It was super hot. But thank god there was a fan! And air conditioning ! (Kind of). The bathrooms were small and they provided some shampoo and body wash. But great! The toilet paper was held in a BIKE LOCK. Our poster in the room fell within 20 seconds of walking inside too. They also provided complementary water bottles so we were able to take some (at least I think they were complimentary).If you want to have a good laugh for a cheap night, you could stay here because it's a good location (20 min walk from Ripleys aquarium).

Since upon arrival when had 1 less person with us so they gave us a double bed room with private bathroom.Which was okay even though I got charged for the 3 bed room 160.00 later.  NOT OKAY. The room had a fridge, and fan as we were on bottom floor. which was much better than being upstairs.There is a older guy who lives there to help the owners out he was very nice and spoke great english unfortunately he has to deal with most of the horrible problems that the owners let occur not fair to him all he is trying to do is make a living.Later in evening of our stay around 11 pm guests arrive back from being out on town  they had 2 small children and 3 ladies they were intl tourists cause of their accents., They come to find out that they had no room anymore the owners took and moved all their things to a totally different housing unit of theirs without letting them know. It was a horrible thing to do to someone not to mention invasion of privacy.The poor guests had to walk almost 15 min further to get to the other location as well they changed the beds on them  they were so angry they asked for their money back got slack for it but I do believe they stayed for free.. I do not blame them.The same night a young chinese guy arrived late then told him they had no room so they sent him away even though he had booked a stay.The little street where this sits has construction across from it I met up with the friendly neighborhood racoon he did not harm just walked around everywhere looking for food.I have stayed with this company many times over the past couple years but I honestly think this might be last straw for me.I can tolerate dingy small rooms, trashy areas, simplicity but this was not acceptable even for a hostel or rooming house. Looking back on it that could of been me in that situation and I tell you the cops would of been called.I am booked for a stay in Dec but am likely going to cancel it and make other arrangements.This time I am giving you a very strong warning Be aware when booking and if you do book make sure you stand your ground and have all your reservations on paper with you.

      "text": "Well, its certainly fair to say that this is not what we were expecting, when we arrived at University Apartments. The price was very much lower than other hotels in Toronto that we looked at. The website said that there were TVs in rooms, but there was just a blank space on the wall where it used to be.Sound insulation in the building is practically none existant, so every footstep echoes throughout the block. We were in a groundfloor room (though you have to use a small flight of steps to access the building). CCTV cameras are everywhere, but it was not clear if they were for the security of guests, or the apartment block operators (who were conspicuous by their absence).On arrival, you 'check-in' by calling one of the numbers listed on the front door. Someone arrives within minutes to take the payment for your room. One bonus is the free wifi, though apart from the decent shower, there are very few other redeeming qualities! Daytime temperatures were around 30 degrees when we were there and there was no air con in the building. Someone did set up large fans to blow air down the corridors at times. A cleaner came every day, though I don't think our room was ever touched and we had the same towels for the whole of the week we were there.There is a fridge in the porch, with bottles of water that guests could purchase, by leaving payment in an honesty box. Check-out was even simpler than check-in. You just dropped your room keys in a bucket!All in all, if you are on a tight budget and don't mind roughing it; this place is ideal. The area around is very safe and it is easy to walk into the centre of Toronto, or get various forms of public transport, just around the corner. There are masses of eaterys of all descriptions within a short distance. A popular Chinese restaurant is a few metres away. At the time of our visit, a new apartment block was being constructed next door and it was very noisy from 6am most mornings.",

Heart of Chinatown in downtown, location is great for price. Hostel was very clean when we were there. It is very basic but the price is right. The check in is just a door way. Owners have basic English skills but not awful. Ask for a room on the bottom of the 3 floors, top floor was pretty stuffy although every room gets a fan. At the time of this review there was MAJOR construction going on NEXT door of a condo building that only looks about 1/2 done at best. Literally a jack hammer started every morning by 9/10am. I'm a laid back traveller, I know the owners can't control this and it only motivated me to get out of the room and explore.This is a basic room at one of the lowest price's I've ever seen in toronto, especially for the location.

      "text": "Firstly, before arriving at the property, we received a mail from bookings.com stating the credit card used to make the booking was not valid and we had to contact the property within 2 hours to confirm the booking. This turned out to be hogwash and a complete time-eating exercise. After multiple calls (which were never returned despite promises to do so)  it became apparent that the so-called 'managers' (Justin and Mike) are unprofessional. They answered the phone with 'yeah?' (Seriously, which professional in the hotel / services sector does that???), were incoherent when they spoke / speak (it made me wonder if they were distracted or poor communicators or just had a poor command of English), and didn't return calls. In short, they come across as apathetic, amateur slum lords out to make a quick buck from their unsuspecting guests. They have clearly received *no* formal training in customer relations / hotel management and are trying to wing it. That doesn't work with educated people who know better. Poor and substandard facilities - Room toilets were constantly clogged and remained unattended to, despite being reported telephonically and in writing (by email). As a result, one set of guests were moved into 3 rooms over 2 nights. After being moved to a new room because of the clogged toilet, they returned late at night to find the room they had been moved into, uncleaned, with the previous occupant's sheets and towels left unchanged. This, despite an agreement in writing that the room would be available and properly prepared for the guests to move into. Safety - here's the biggest shocker - a colleague's room was broken into and his locked bag, was also broken into. The manager's response to this incident was deplorable. The so-called manager (Justin) refused to come to the property to attend to the matter, claiming he was half an hour away. The other manager (or maybe he was the absent owner - Mike?) claimed he was in New York. The traumatized guest was thus forced to deal with the police himself. Separately, someone repeatedly tried to turn the door handle of another colleague's room on two separate occasions, late at night. We consistently found the front door wide open and unattended to. This basically meant that anyone could walk off the alley into the hotel and gain access to rooms. In short, the property is not access controlled and is unsafe. Location - while the hotel was somewhat conveniently located (near the corner of Dundas and Spadina, in the heart of Chinatown), the hotel itself is located in a quiet, isolated, small dead end lane, opposite a skip / dumpster. Certainly not the best or prettiest of settings. Room size and accessibility - most rooms are tiny. Two people would battle to find space for both their respective suitcases. There are no elevators, so guests have to be prepared to carry their heavy luggage up a narrow sets of stairs (barefoot or in socks,  as shoes are not permitted up the stairs). ***In summary, avoid this dive! It's basically a roach motel run by unprofessional amateurs.***",

Subsequently, there came a Chinese who moved us to another room, which had a bunk bed and a double bed, a fan, a microwave and a refrigerator. The room and bathroom were very small and narrow. The window, broken by a broken air conditioner, stood open because of the rotten, inoperative air conditioner.

They come in because we leave the door open.\" I pointed out that they should do something about it. To humor me, he said that they stuffed hole but that they were coming nonetheless. He put foam in our room to prevent the mouse from leaving it's nest. Then, he saw the old moldy pillows that are holding the air conditioning in place. He said \"Cool!\".

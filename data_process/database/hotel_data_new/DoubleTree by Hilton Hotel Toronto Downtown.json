I've stayed in all of the other Hilton brands in Toronto over the past four years, and the staff at this hotel was the best.  Everyone I encountered was very friendly and helpful.  Unlike the Hilton in Toronto, the DoubleTree still offers a wonderful breakfast for their Hilton Diamond members.  The buffet was really good, and the staff was very friendly.I had dinner at their hotel restaurant on my first night, and it was very good as well.I liked the ability to self-park in their garage underneath the hotel as compared to the valet service at other Toronto hotels.  It was nice being able to retrieve my vehicle as needed and not have to wait for the valet.Last but not least - their chocolate cookies are incredible!",

      "text": "For our 10th wedding anniversary, I booked the 2 room premium suite. I normally wouldn't book a room in its price range but being a special occasion I thought it would be worth the extra expense. Also, given the hotel is in the Hilton chain, I had an expectation of a higher standard that would make this occasion extra special. However, when I arrived at the front desk, I had an unfavorable first impression which did not change through the duration of my stay. The first thing that I noticed is that the plexiglass covid-19 shields at the front desk were grimy. Then, when approaching our suite, I couldn't help but notice how dirty the carpeted hallway was. The carpet wasn't in bad condition, it just need a good vacuuming and maybe a steam cleaning. The dust looked like it had accumulated over months and debris that was scattered on the carpet remained so during my stay.  The building is in need of sprucing up. Doors and furniture have major scratches and scrapes and a fresh coat of paint would brighten up the common areas and rooms. Signs are posted all over about covid-19 protocol which is a good thing. However, waiters in the hotel's restaurant walked around with their noses unmasked. The restaurant layout is such that you can see in the kitchen. One chef was properly wearing his mask while the other literally wore it around her elbow.  There are some positive things though. The suite, including the bathroom, towels, and sheets, was very clean and was very quiet. The staff were very pleasant. The hotel's location is close to other restaurants and the Eaton Centre, City Hall, and Queen's Park and having its own parking lot made it easy to ditch our car during our stay and not have to worry about it. Would I recommend staying there? Well, it all depends on your expectations.",

We love this area whenever we are in Toronto for a concert, hockey game, shopping, etc.Service: Excellent as always! Courteous and friendly check-in, we had a very early flight so arrived at the hotel at 10:30 AM and we were granted early check-in to our room with no wait time. Bonus! Each morning we received a text from the hotel asking if everything was to our liking, was there anything else we needed, etc. A very nice personal touch that we really appreciated!Room: Very comfortable king bed with fluffy but firm pillows, a very functional room, albeit a bit small. Having a fridge was a bonus.We requested extra towels and received them promptly each day. We were on the 19th floor and had a great view.

This is a party hotel, we were awoken at 3 in the morning with signing and loud music and had a horrible night sleep. Would not recommend if you are looking for a relaxing weekend. I‚Äôm confused to how this hotel received a 4 star rating and is a Hilton. As a side note the underground parking is incredibly narrow and hard to navigate and the AC is the room is very loud and periodically stops working.The only good thing about this hotel is the location.

The location of this hotel is terrific, easy walk to most of the Toronto hotspots, if you can't walk, the subway is close by. The bed was quite comfortable, not too firm but with good support. The bad. The hotel is just dated, it's desperately in need of a full-property renovation. It's clear that some things have been done (the carpets in the room and wallpaper had clearly been redone) but there is so much more work to do. The hallways are drab , dated, and stained. The sconces in the room were all damaged and crooked. The desk chair (see photo) was quite damaged. There was also a thick layer of dust (see picture) that occurred every night, either from the HVAC or the bedding. While the housekeepers always did a great job of cleaning the room, including this dust, it came back the next morning without fail. The bathroom was very small with very little counter space. Breakfast buffet was just ok from a food quality perspective. The service at breakfast wasn't good. I started taking down my own water bottle because it was impossible to get someone to fill my glass with water. I wouldn't stay at this hotel again and I wouldn't recommend it to others. Hopefully the owner takes a page out of the Hilton down the street which just finished a complete property-wide renovation.",

The hotel was perfectly situated near the financial district, eaton centre, chinatown, etc. Everything we needed within a 5-10 minute walking distance.The hotel room was comfortable although not overly spacious (we stayed in a double room on the 6th floor). Good water pressure and fast hot water in the bathroom. Comfy beds too. The staff were excellent and pleasant.The underground parking was full from the time we got there to the time we left. The hotel charges $45/day for underground parking, which isn't as horrible as the parking lot up the street that is $89/day. However the Parking Garage literally across the street (89 Chestnut St) is only $26/day. (Part of the UoT building). Much cleaner, brightly lit, and cheaper. The only \"bad\" thing I will comment on is the smell in the lobby of the hotel. The title of my review comes from my 7 year old niece when she first walked into the lobby. It's true, the entire three days we stayed here, the lobby smelled like the bottom of a kitchen garbage can. The elevators, our hallway and our room did not smell. Just the lobby. So badly it's not a stretch to say we held our breath until we could get outside. I would probably stay here again, but I might check the status of the smell first.",

Guests who had obviously traveled as a group spent two nights talking loudly in the halls, slamming doors, and generally behaving badly between 2 and 3 in the morning.  This went on for 3 nights.More offensive however was the interaction I had with a surly staff member at reception.  I had delivered a bag of laundry to the reception in the hope that it could be cleaned within the period stated on the form in the room.  The staff member rudely told me that the service was considerably less regular and presented this information as some form of challenge.

We were absolutely blown away by his exceptional customer service. We will be definitely be coming back because of Henry!!!",

      "text": "Don‚Äôt stay here.  Service is terrible. I stayed for one night for work and got attacked by bed bugs.  I had bites all over my body that developed 2 days later.  When I reported this to the hotel, they said they would evacuate the room and do a inspection the next day.  4 days later, they finally did an inspection and when I complained about the tardiness and lack of correspondence, they said that there was someone in the room, so they could not do the inspection.  When I inquired about why they kept someone in the room despite bed bugs they said that it wasn‚Äôt in their protocol to evacuate a room for a bed bug report!!!  The inspection revealed at there were bed bug carcasses found, but no activity.  They therefore were not offering any compensation!  I‚Äôm sorry but carcasses should mean that bed bugs were present!!!!! Only after requesting that I speak to the general manager did I get the bed bug report (attached) and the first manager said there was no evidence of anything in my room.  So to summarize, many days of horrible correspondence, misinformation and no appreciation for the issue.  Save yourself the stress and grief and do not stay here.",

Requested cleaning and was told they were too busy for two days.The location was great.The room itself looked like it was poorly repaired after a party.I rented a suite and had some who snores sharing the room.  Suites do not have doors on the bedroom.  Would have rented two separate rooms instead if I had known.",

      "text": "Fantastic location! Right behind Nathan Phillips Square. Easy 15-20 min walk to tons of great sites, restaurants and shopping. 5 min walk to Dundas Square. Heavy duty construction right next door, so a bit dusty and not very attractive. I expected there to be disruptive construction noise, but it was pretty quiet. Hotel, itself, is dated. Room was not very clean. Mold on the bathtub caulking and I found long hairs under the covers on the bed. Eww.Fantastic gym! Has bench, free weights, pull down machines, elliptical, treadmills, etc.Service was not good. Waited 20 mins upon check in and not even a greeting when we finally got service. Not friendly at all at check in or check out. Because of covid, there is no housekeeping service. Your room will not be cleaned during your stay. No one told us this upon check in so we ran out of towels the first day. Tried to call front desk, housekeeping, concierge 5 times over 2 hours. Not a single answer. Went down to front desk to request towels, and it took 2 tries bc it was so busy. Finally when I got service, the front desk clerk was apologetic and explained they are understaffed. Fair enough, but you still need to figure out a solution. You can't just not answer the phone, not provide towels or room cleaning, and have an unsmiling face waiting for you after your 20 minute wait for front desk service. Yikes.I don't know if I'd stay here again. The location is just so great at the price, but the service and the cleanliness needs serious work.",

      "text": "Hotel occupancy rates in the city are historically low, and Doubletree is generally a consistently reliable brand so I felt confident booking this room. Although the room was clean and the service at the front desk was great, it was clear there were a lot of cuts as this wasn't really anywhere near the pre-pandemic level of service I expected from Doubletree.First of all, the cookie is gone. Yes, it's minor, but that really was an amazing thing that kind of made Doubletrees unique. To add insult to injury, they still have the visuals of this delicious memory around the hotel to remind you what you aren't receiving when you check in. I even called down and was told that it wouldn't be returning anytime soon. Second, housekeeping has been reduced. I was here for a 5 day stay and my room was only cleaned once. Again, COVID-19 was to blame, but most hotels have restored their service levels and are back to daily service, so this was pretty irksome. I totally get the staffing shortage, etc., but to me this wasn't really acceptable. Other than that, rooms are good if not a bit small. It's your typical 4-star hotel but the room rates are historically low at this property and it's attracted some less than savory characters, so I'd keep the deadbolt on the door if I choose to stay there again.",

Great location in Downtown Toronto close to all the main attractions and shopping. We even got free parking in the side street with the use of a permit from the Hotel. There is no bar, restaurant or other amenities in this hotel but at $80 CA (Â£40) including taxes this was one of the cheapest and best hotels I stayed in whilst touring Ontario. Some rooms have a fridge or computer; all rooms have TV, hairdryer, iron. Only slight drawback some visitors might find off-putting is beggars on the street corners asking for money but just say no and walk on. All in all excellent value for money.",

It is a great location (ex Allen Gardens, College street cars). But if you are the type who is afraid of friendly Ryerson University students (the campus is right next to the hotel on Gerard), then stay away.- The hotel has all the amenities one could hope for (AC, ironing board and iron, coffe maker, bedside reading lamps, cable, alarm clock). The rooms are clean. However, if you are the type who gets queasy over a plastered wall, a scratched table or a rusty rad then you should not travel at all. Just stay at home.- The hotel offers a complimentary breakfast (I had toasted raisin bagels with coffee and  bran cereal with milk) with a free newspaper.- I can imagine that the hotel could be noisy during the summer when it is full, but you would have the option of running the 9000 btu AC unit in your room to drown out the noise. I went off season (December) and the hotel was extremely quiet and warm.- Don't forget to tip the maid.",

      "text": "I believe I wrote a review of this place a few years back saying I was pleasantly surprised by the quality considering the low price.  Well, the same can be said again.  You can frequently get a room here for under $100 a night - cheaper than most Air BnBs downtown - and it's a perfectly nice room.  Unlike most two star hotels, where you're likely going to be dealing with stains in the bathroom, maybe some mildewy tiles or chipping tubs, dowdy looking furniture, carpets, and linens, the owners of this Econolodge seem to keep on top of necessary renos and keep the place looking inviting. This time we had a small room with a queen size bed, desk, fridge, drawers, tv, coffee maker and ironing board.  It had what appeared to be inexpensive flooring designed to look like hardwood, but it was in good shape.  There were no stains or chips on anything.  My partner, who worked in hotels for years, noticed one piece of stray cobweb in a corner that hadn't been cleaned, but I likely wouldn't have noticed.  Our bathroom had a clean, faux marble counter and clean subway tile in the bath/shower area. The price of the room includes free wifi and a modest, free breakfast (cereal, toast, bagels, fruit and beverages).  And the hotel is two blocks off downtown Yonge Street and three blocks to the College Subway station. Oh!  Also, the staff were great about accommodating our need for separate receipts for each night of our stay, one for me and one for my partner, because of our expensing needs.  You really can't get better value for your money in the heart of the city.",

The only way you could hear noise outside is if you stuck your head out the window. And the area is not all that noisy for a major downtown intersection. It would be disingenuous to complain about noise in the center of a large city like Toronto. The people who live and frequent the area (including the lovely Allen Gardens plant conservatory across the street) are wonderful. Some are down on there luck, some crazy, some eccentric some just tourists like me. Toronto is a pathetic city but the Econo Lodge is an exception that makes the city much more bearable.",

It was extremely tiny, old, the room smelled of smoke, the walls and carpets are stained, the bed has stains and cigarette burns on it, and the furniture is falling apart. My friend and I had to buy a can of Febreeze to get over the smell (we used the entire can). There were no other rooms available, as there's a big convention in town and the city is sold out. The hotel does seem to be doing some retrofitting, there were boxes of LCD TV's in the lobby to replace the current old CRT TV's in the rooms.  It feels like a very old building, and has no elevator. Don't expect any more than a small dirty room with a bed. If you're used to cleaner and more modern stays, like Sheraton, Four Points, Garden Inn, Holiday Inn, Radisson, Best Western, Super 8, etc, try to find that instead.",

      "text": "The list of bad things about this hotel goes on and on, the only good thing was that the bed was comfortable. The neighborhood is full of crackheads and prostitutes, I checked in after a long drive at 5am after booking this on hotwire.  The booking said \"pet friendly\" and no checkout time was specified.  First thing that happened after I got my room key was the front desk guy (Expedito) phones me to say that \"check out is at 11am\" - which was not specified in my hotwire documentation, nor was he able to prove that to me.  Most hotel check out times in Toronto is noon, but what I found most irritating was the fact that immediately after I entered the room he is on the phone telling me about the check out time as if \"we can't wait to get you out of here\". That has never happened to me before, he didn't even give me a chance to put down my bags and review the hotel policies in the binder on the desk.  Speaking of the binder on the desk, it did not include a WIFI password, and I could clearly see that checkout time had once been noon, and was now whited out to say 11am.  I felt like the guy at the front desk was being discriminatory towards me, so even though I wanted the wifi password, I was too upset to call back and ask him for it. Not to mention, the booking had been paid for on Hotwire and the payment went through, but he was trying to tell me that I gave them an incorrect Mastercard when I don't have a Mastercard, I only have a Visa - something seemed not quite right about that. The next thing that happened was that the TV cable connection was not working properly. There would be lines going down the screen no matter how hard we tried to tighten it.  The  \"A/C\" unit in the room is one of those external ones with a hose that is suuper noisy, made it hard to sleep.  When my boyfriend came into the hotel with our dog, the front desk guy ran into the hallway and yelled at us \"how are you going to pay for the extra pet fee\"  not taking into account that it's after 5am in the morning and he might wake other guests.  I told him I wanted to sleep and that I'd take it up with front desk at checkout.I awaken at 11am sharp by the next front desk woman (Hason sp?)  telling me I need to leave or they're going to charge me for another night.  SINCE WHEN has this ever happened that a hotel can't give you a few minute's grace for checking out? They were clearly discriminating against me for whatever reason. She then reminded me about this \"pet fee\" that I was never aware of in the booking and proceeded to charge me 20$ plus tax.  She was extremely rude.The cherry on top is that when I got home I found a bedbug in my suitcase.I would not recommend this hotel to my worst enemy.",

You have to do things in a real hurry if you don't want people to be angrily honking their horns behind you. We had to leave our car parked on the street because the nearest paid parking lot cost about 25 dollars plus taxes the overnight. Something else to be pointed out is safety. The windows from the second floor, for example, give view to a short roof which can be easily climbed from the street. I'd be no surprised to see someone staring at my room through the window, that's why I left the curtains closed during the entire time of my stay.

Within 100 yards of the back of the hotel there is a free medical clinic and the streets were lined with over 100 homeless, mentally ill or drug depedants folks and one 6 foot tall cross dresser soliciting business. As we completed the block, there never was a place to pull over so I stopped in the traffic lane as close to the front door as possible.  My wife was going in to see where to unload but she had her path blocked at the entrance door by a woman who was obviously high demanding money.  The clerk came out and ran her off.  My wife was told that we had to pull into another business down the street and carry our bags up the sidewalk.  We had had a long day and it was getting dark so we decided to stay and barricade ourself in the room.  I parked the rental car in an unguarded public parking lot about three blocks away, paid my $20.00 and drug my suitcases back down the street.     When you enter the front door, you immediately go down 6 steps to get to the front desk.  The coffee machine and the ice machine both had out of order tags on them.  We were shown to our room which on on the first floor street side.  The other option was third floor with no elevator.     Once in our room, we realized that because the first floor is down in a hole, that the bottom of our window was even with the side walk.  Six feet away was a busy street that had traffic all night long.  There was a small fridge but the freezer compartment was completely frosted closed.  The phone cord was partially pulled out of the wall and the phone was dead.  The air conditioner was a portable unit that sat in the floor and had a 6 inch flexible exhaust like a dryer vent about 8 feet long that connected to a piece of plywood with a hole cut in it that replaced the window glass.  If you sat immediately in front of the vents you got cool air.  The rest of the room was heated by the exhaust tube.     It was dark now but we were hungry so I went alone to a small burger joint across the street to get something to bring back to the room.  I believe it was called Harry's.  It was comletely dark by now and the free clinic had apparently closed because the streets were filled with those folks who had been in street behind the hotel.  As I made my way back across two streets, I felt like I was in the movie, Night of the Living Dead.  I made it to the room.  The burgers were remarkable so at least there was one high point.

The heat in the room didn't work, the florescent light in the bathroom never fully turn on and just flickered, there is no floor space so opening your suitcase and walking are mutually exclusive, and they have a large air conditioner taking up floor space with an industrial hose going to the window, there was no do-not-disturb door hanger and I was disturb by the cleaner, and all day and night you can hear people and traffic on the street outside at full volume even with the window closed. I phoned and arranged a late check-out (promised to me by my rewards program), but either they didn't take note of it or they chose not to honor it and they harassed me the next day. Even the WiFi was slow and intermittent. And Jacob at the front desk is extremely disrespectful and has no business working in customer service. Why would a hotel hire someone that 'puts on airs'?",

      "text": "I stayed two nights at Econo Lodge. It was one of the lowest priced hotels in the city, but I was pleasantly surprised -- and I will stay here again.  The only downside was slightly weak shower pressure, but other than this, it was great.  Breakfast was good, and wifi internet worked great.This is a good location on the edge of the university.  It's a safe area and reasonably close to things: 3 min walk to Carlton/College streetcar; 10 min walk to College subway station; 5 min walk to the best Loblaws store in Toronto (groceries & ready food).Parking is a bit difficult, as with everywhere in the downtown.  There's a lot near Yonge & Gerrard that's $12 for a full 24 hours of parking, but no in-and-outs.  A closer lot just one block north is $23 for 24 hours, but you can do in-and-outs as long as it's not packed.",

However it backs on to a homeless shelter which made me very uneasy and I was harassed for change every time I entered. Furthermore there was a prostitute standing outside the front doors when we arrived after dinner. Hotel was alright but I felt very unsafe. Will never stay there again...",

Sign in was quick and easy overal pretty painless we were given two keys and quickly came to our room.. After reading lots of reviews I was worried room would be in distraught in major need to a face lift but I was plesently surprised to open door to a clean, cozy space with high end upgrades... The room included two beds a pull out sofa and a fridge ( which I requested prior to our arrival).The location and price of hotel can not be beat we paid just 115 for the night which is crazy for four ppl in the core of the city...! My only complaints are the heating and cooling I could not for the life of me figure out how to get the heat off and ac on... So we slept in 30degree weather which was slightly uncomfortable also... The windows open which is nice but there are no screens and in this neighbourhood who really feels like leaving a window open...? Also the ppl staying above us were either morbidly obese or enjoyed pacing back and forth all day and night... Walls are apparently paper thin which kind of sucks!Overall it exceeded my expectation! Will def come back again!",

There were several cigarette burns on the carpet, markings on the wallpaper, and damage on the washroom ceiling, but the queen bed was comfortable.",

I was later awakened at 4am by a lady screaming on my floor for some reason. I felt very unsafe. I cancelled my reservation for the second night.

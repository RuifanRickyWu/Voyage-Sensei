Absolutely no hotel information in the room other than an extremely expensive list of items for sale which included a small bottle of water for .‚Ç¨5.00! Larger bottles were free in the majority of far less expensive hotels we‚Äôve stayed in over the past two weeks. Weird bathroom! No door and bath gel in fixed bottles mounted far too high to reach whilst bathing. Great TV but sadly no channel guide do we had no clue what we could watch. Only 3 coffee pods and two creamers provided and not replaced (until we asked) for our second night. Not the hotels fault but they could have warned us about the massive construction going on in the street outside.Bedside USB sockets don‚Äôt work!",

First let me say that I am very fussy about hotels and truthfully I am not a big fan of staying in hotels mainly because of issues like I am afraid to touch the bedspread and have even went as far as to bring my own towels and sheets when staying in hotels and we are not talking here about cheap hotels.  Well there is no need to do any of that at Le Germain.  It is a phenomenal hotel, just outstanding in every way. The lobby is breathtaking and very welcoming as is the staff, which we have always found to be very polite, friendly and helpful.  The rooms are modern yet cozy with plenty of space for your luggage.  I especially like the the choice of lighting and beside each side of the bed there are two lights to choose from, not counting the relaxing pot lights over the window and great desk lamp for your computer or other needs. The bed is ultra comfortable and the bedding is so clean and fresh, I have really never stayed anywhere else with bedding this incredible, well that is except the other Germain Hotel we have stayed at in Quebec City (The Hotel Dominion 1912).  The bathroom is amazing, very clean and with a great vanity to put your makeup on...and the luxurious rainfall shower is the highest quality shower I have ever seen anywhere.  I would seriously never even consider staying any where else when we visit Toronto.  For whatever reason we stay at this hotel we always feel like we are on vacation while staying here and the only negative I can think of is having to leave.  Thank you for taking the time to read my review!",

We didn't have dinner at the restaurant but did have drinks and found the space to be very cool and the sevice excellent. The staff could not have been nicer with one doorman braving a rain storm to ensure we had a cab available to us quickly. The gym could be significantly better but given the rest of the experience we would go back in a heartbeat !",

Be sure to book a table when you make your reservation.It's not a cheap hotel, but I'd recommend it over the comparably-priced Soho Met any day of the week.

Room (at the front of the building) was, however, very noisy with a constant ‚Äòhum‚Äô which made sleeping a little difficult, and there is major construction work going on directly opposite. Staff are great - very friendly and helpful.",

      "text": "I have been a loyal guest since its opening in 2003. That in itself says a lot. However, much has changed over the years. This hotel used to be the pinnacle of a boutique hotel.  Beautiful decor, chocolates near your bed, an incredible breakfast included in your stay, bottled water as you leave the hotel, and soaps and lotions from Molton Brown. Sadly, no chocolates, no breakfast, no water, no Molton Brown products. All the extras that I loved are gone. Not sure what caused the decision to eliminate these lovely perks. Worst of all, the surrounding construction has limited the sunlight into the hotel casting some darkness on several parts of the hotel. What hasn't changed, is the impeccable service and the staff's willingness to help with any request.",

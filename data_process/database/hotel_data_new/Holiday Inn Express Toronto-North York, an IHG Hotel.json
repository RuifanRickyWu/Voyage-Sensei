I usually stay close to the airport but decided to try out this location and was very happy with how central it was to my appointments all over the GTA.If you're looking for a newly-renovated or new HIE this is not the place.  With that said the room was spotless, the common areas were kept clean (even though I visited during a snowstorm which always leads to a mess on the floors at least), and the breakfast was above average for an HIE.  The breakfast room was larger than most and I never had trouble finding parking right in front, two things that drive me crazy at many hotels (nowhere to sit and nowhere to park)!I would not pay top dollar for this hotel but if you can find it reasonably priced for your stay there's absolutely nothing wrong with it.",

      "title": "Average property that could make some simple changes",
      "text": "Here is one of those properties that could get another star very easily by making some simple changes. First off, typical check-in, staff were average, but their English was good (something becoming more rare every day in the Toronto area). A few simple tweaks like good eye contact or a good smile and a great 1st impression would of been made to an otherwise average check-in. Snack choices at the area to the rear of the desk are very limited, double or triple the choices or get a vending machine that can offer a wider selection. I asked for Milk and indicated that I did not care how much it cost, the staff member was nice enough to grab some off the buffet breakfast fridge and gave it to me free. Why not stock it in the fridge and charge for it? Lobby was clean, and public areas were in good shape. The pool was absolutely freezing, and I like it a bit on the cool side, kids were in there for 5 mins and had to leave. Should be turned up at least 5-8 degrees. The gym is your typical small area with an elliptical, a couple of tread mills, and a variety of dumb bells, nothing special but it was clean and all machines were working. No cups for water, but I usually bring my own so no big deal. Room was clean and had a coffee maker and microwave, but no in room movies or video games for the kids. There needs to be some sort of entertainment for families, if we had known there were no in house movies we would of not booked. Family tradition to watch a movie or two before bed. We stayed at another hotel not far from here that gave the kids a welcome pack, was nothing more then a cool room key and some colouring book stuff but established themselves off the bat as family friendly. The wifi signal was good throughout the property. And then there was the buffet breakfast in the mornings... ok first off go early or late because from 8-9:30 it is an absolute zoo. Be prepared to bring your breakfast back to the room because seating area will be full up. The buffet is set up in a totally backwards fashion, really there should be some sort of arrows on the floor indicating which direction people should flow, but the area should be broken up into 4 stations around the room. The toasting area is in the middle and there are borderline shoving matches to get in and out - crazy. If they broke the buffet into four and had it in each corner of the room, things would not only flow better, but it would be much easier for staff to stock. Whoever set this up was someone that must not of given it a lot of thought, or had no experience in knowing how large groups \"attack\" a buffet. People will follow arrows and instructions, but when neither of those are there chaos ensues.Check out was good, no hidden costs and was strait forward.Long and short of it is that I will not stay here again unless the following was done: 1)Pool temperature turned up, or Jacuzzi is installed. 2)Breakfast buffet setup is altered to some sort of set up that makes sense.3)Some in-house entertainment must be offered in the rooms.   4)The property makes some sort of effort to make the kids feel welcome.Do the above and I will not just come back, but recommend the property to others.",

      "text": "Family Vacation Time - the one time all summer that my sister and I get away with the kids. Picked this hotel as it was close to the Zoo and Wonderland, and it had a \"new pool\". Disappointment #1: Not sure what was new about the pool, but the chlorine levels were so high, the kids jumped in and jumped right back out. All 3 spent the next 30 minutes standing under showers to stop the burning in their eyes, on their faces and on their bodies. Disappointment #2: No Cot. Although requested, the staff refused to provide a cot (indicating that there were already 2 double beds in the room, so we didn't need a cot too). Sorry, but a 9 year old boy does not like sleeping with his 6 year old sister. So, we finally begged for a couple of extra blankets and he slept on the floor.  Disappointment #3: Loud Ceiling Fans in the bathroom. Ours woke my son up in the middle of the night (you can't go into the bathroom without turning on the fan AND the light). He thought that a plane was landing in the bedroom.  Disappointment #4: Housekeeping knocked on our door at 7:30 in the freaking morning to see if we had left the room.  (No, there are no \"Do Not Disturb\" signs...but come on, 7:30 AM?)  This woke the kids up....thanks a lot.  Disappointment #5: \"Business Centre\" is in the hallway beside the breakfast room so, no chance to quietly do any business before leaving.  Disappointment #6:  Extremely rude staff at the front desk who seemed to go out of their way to not meet our needs! Long story - the 6 year old lost a tooth at the zoo, we called the hotel to ask them to leave a note for us at the front desk stating \"The Tooth Fairy knows you are at the hotel and will get your tooth, no worries\" so that the 6 year old could calm down.  When we checked in - NO NOTE. They staff didn't know about our call and no record was on our confirmation. At check out, turns out the man who took our call was working - he proceeded to lecture us (in front of our 3 children) on how it was not a good idea for parents to tell the kids that the Tooth Fairy was real and then gave us an article out of the newspaper!Now, it is no ones business but ours as to how we raise our kids. If you can't do someone a favor because it goes against your religious/moral beliefs, then you should not be working in an industry where customer service is required.  We left this hotel absolutely furious.  This is NOT about whether it is a good/bad idea to teach children about the Tooth Fairy or Santa Claus - this is about a simple request to leave a note for a 6 year old child.  If we had asked to have a room facing North because (FOR EXAMPLE), I needed to face north to pray, then I should receive a room facing North (and not a lecture that I can pray facing in any direction).Needless to say, we will never ever stay at this hotel again.

Front desk staff really unhelpful, and frankly quite rude, bordering on useless.  My room wasn't cleaned properly--again front desk had no explanation or suggestion for the problem.  Insufficient coffee supply throughout the day.  The windows were fogging up so I decided to use a cloth and wipe the windows myself--came out black coloured!  Again, front desk didn't really care.  When you don't care about your own hotel, you don't really care about your guests!  Many better choices people.  A friend helped me bring up my luggage and even they were shocked at the state of the place.  This is not a real gem for Toronto; in fact, a real embarrasment to Toronto and Holiday Inn.

For those desiring to visit Toronto, and stay with family in an affordable but well appointed setting, this is a great choice. The staff were courteous and well informed. Cortney in the front desk was quite helpful in helping us get to the bus stand, bus routes, and subway information, Shri was helpful in providing us with information about where to eat-and when we checked out early, upon our request, provided us with fruits and milk for our long drive back. The breakfast items were plentiful. If you are driving your own car and like to visit Toronto, note that one can get to downtown in about 15-20 minutes (weekends and off rush hours) but it can take up to 45 minutes during rush hour. There are plenty of fast food restaurants and a money changer (Western Union open for 24 hours) in a walking distance of 5-10 minutes. There is a police station next to the hotel, so it is quite safe! The #36 bus route goes up and down Finch Avenue and to the subway station. Again, the travel time is based on the time of the day.

This Holiday Inn Express was the most reasonably priced one in the area.  I have been here several times before. It's pretty well my go to place if I have things to do in downtown Toronto.It has easy access to major highways like 400, 401, 407 and is only 8km from Pearson International Airport, but it's not an airport hotel. The TTC Subway line 1 extension from Sheppard West Station to Vaughn Mills Shopping Centre makes my commute to downtown even easier! The nearest Subway station is now only 3km away instead of the original 10km to Sheppard west Station. Finch West station at the corner of Keele and Finch West. See TTC web sight for more information.The check in at the  hotel was fast and courteous. Parking is FREE! in the hotel lot. Lots of room to park. The wifi is good. The room was exactly what I was expecting. It was very inviting.The AC was not working at first. I looked at it and all it needed was that the plug in for the AC had 2 buttons on the side of it. I pushed one of them. The green light came on and the AC worked. The control panel was on the wall it was easy to operate.The TV was fine. The only thing I found was that the remotes batteries were low. The beds were very comfortable if you like a soft bed. There were 2 lounge chairs and a desk chair with a desk to do whatever work you have to do. Fridge and microwave a big +.The bathroom was very clean and well lighted. There was only a shower, no tub. But the shower could easily fit 2 people....The only things I found were there was a hole in the bathroom door that was previously patched. Could have done a better job and used paint that matched the colour of the door. There were 2 small holes on the back of the door where the hook was. they were not fixed yet. the blackout curtains worked great! The breakfast was typical for a Holiday Inn Express.We were there 2 nights. Over all the stay was fine for us.

I then pulled back the covers of the bed and YIKES!  I was not happy with what I saw.  Called the front desk to get someone up to fix the mess, but they had no staff, so another room was offered.  They said they would give me 1,000 points.  I have not seen these.The back up room was fine.  Breakfast was just ok.  Stayed on 6th floor which is a good idea if you decide to take the risk of staying here.",

      "text": "This hotel merits a whole new category of rating on Trip Advisor below the terrible rating,  a mere terrible rating would be too complimentary for this hotel horror! I have stayed in a large number of hotels around the world over many years. Many hotels were excellent, some were mediocre, a few were poor but only one hotel can be described as total garbage, the Holiday Bin Express! I cannot think of one positive comment to pass on this hotel. The room itself was ugly, in dire need of renovation and offered hardly any facilities, not even a mini safe or a proper wardrobe. The few facilities that were offered were of unacceptable standards. The air conditioning made a noise like a tractor on its last legs, the curtains were too small for the window and did not block the light or the horrible view from the window,None of the television channels worked rendering the TV of purely ornamental value. The bathroom was depressing and dingy and there was unsightly mould growing on the shower base which looked like some kind of experiment to develop a new penicillin! Our teenage children were staying in another room and their toilet didn't flush properly despite making a non stop noise resembling a small waterfall. Maybe the highlight of our stay or should I say the \" no light\" was the way that the hotel dealt with a regional power cut! No backup generator and a failure to activate the emergency lighting in the staircase meant that the guests had to dangerously navigate flights of stairs in total darkness; this typifies the appalling low standards this hotel has set for itself. The front desk administration followed the lead of the awful state of the hotel itself. Our credit card was blocked in the amount of $800 when we arrived as a condition of our stay although I'm not quite sure what it was meant to cover; possibly the value of the whole hotel itself in its current state!! When I checked out I was told that the receipt was given to my wife who was outside in the taxi at the time which was taking us to the airport.It was not given to her.Fortunately I asked the front desk to email me a copy of this receipt which they confirmed they would do.Unfortunately they have still not done so despite the fact that 4 days have passed since we checked out of the hotel. We originally booked this hotel largely because of its proximity to Canada's Wonderland. It is actually not that near, about a 15 minute drive away and there are a number of hotels which are much nicer and nearer.Interestingly it is no longer mentioned on the Wonderland website. On the other hand if you want to experience Canada's Horrorland, this is the hotel for you!",

Upon getting to the hotel, we were informed there is no shuttle or parking for the week. HOWEVER, even though we had not booked directly through Holiday Inn Express they ensured that we had a van to take us to the airport and they allowed us to park our vehicle for the week free of charge. KUDOS to Holiday inn express--this is one of our favorite chains for this reason!",

He could not answer.  He treated us like kids. He used Walmart in reference to our request.This hotel was always in a rough state. They upgraded most of this location.  Look OK.  Breakfast is OK.

When it came time to check out I was told I would have to pay $25 EXTRA because we left the room \"dirty\".  The only reason the room was dirty was because the house keepers didn't clean the room. Didn't pay over $500 to have to make my own bed. My friends and I will NEVER return to any holiday inn. Staff was rude and disrespectful towards us.",

Later that night, we got back and noticed the housekeeper did not do anything to the bed, she left the blankets and sheets balled up in the corner of the bed.. she didn't even vaccum the floor. The only thing she did do was change the garbage bags and new towels. Very disappointed. Second day we didn't even bother taking our do not disturb sign off since it was pointless.

He said \"Sure, its $25 more.\"  So how is that FREE?  Its not only NOT free but $5 MORE than Canada's Wonderland charges.  I argued the definition of free for 10 minutes and then asked for the manager.  \"He wont be in for 3 days\". WOW. Ok so I called back after 3 days.  The manager (the same gentleman that responds to these reviews) said the clerk was right.  Finally after arguing the definition of FREE for 10 more minutes he says \"You wouldn't even know it was more if you didn't try to switch packages and anyway its the end of the season\".  So that's what kind of customer service to expect.  Also they rejected my review on there sight for no valid reason.",

We had paid for a King size bed room, but they gave us a much smaller room in return.

      "text": "Although the location of this place is great, some things are severely lacking. It is not geared towards short stays at all.The apartment was lovely and clean, but absolutely freezing - it was approx 10 degrees celsius outside and the air conditioning was on. I asked security at reception about it and they said only building management could turn off the AC. Luckily they gave me a heater for two days to use which I really appreciated.The walls are not sound proof and light comes into the bedrooms easily, so it's not easy to sleep. The security are not welcoming towards short stay residents at all, especially since majority of the apartment block has full time residents. They wouldn't accept deliveries of a couple of boxes to reception, even though other residents were picking stuff up. They also would not store our luggage on the last day like a hotel would, saying they only stored stuff for residents. Credit where credits due, they allowed us to borrow a heater and a trolley to take up our luggage, but overall v unhelpful.You also only receive one key (there were two of us staying in two different rooms), and no fob to open two other doors, we had to constantly ask security to open them for us. On the final day they refused to call us a taxi to the airport, saying 'there's a hotel across the road, ask them', even though they had called us cabs on at least 2 occasions previously during our stay. Overall I was disappointed and would not return, especially for a business trip.",

I made a request of early check in as i was travelling all the way from india, instead of helping out i got to know that at security they dont even know which room was allotted to me. So i had to wait over 90 mins for some one to tell me that this is your room which is currently getting cleaned at 3:30 pm when check-in time is 4 pm. When we reached the room , it was a mess, cleaner was still cleaning it. But it had insects all over the place, broken glasses on floor, wet sheets, hair strands all over the floor. So we told the guy just clean to optimum level and then leave as we wanted to crash .... When after some time i called the help desk that room was in pathetic shape pls change my room, i got the answer that i rushed the guy... Well how sloppy and slow are their cleaners? the check out time is 10 am...and check in 4 pm... in 6 hrs they cant get the room right...? And whats with total disregard for customer service , i requested 2 weeks prior to coming that i will reach 2 hrs before check in time, pls give me early check in as i would be in a flight for 22 hrs before reaching... but i got a garbage filled room instead .....NOT A PLACE TO STAY...",

Easy access to Metro and trolley bus services. Could not have asked to be in a better location for my tastes and needs. Plenty restaurants and drinking establishments in area. Pleasantly surprised with bonus of a small pool and Gym facilities at the top of the apartment. Very good value.",

      "text": "I prefer to stay in a condo or airbnb type atmosphere when I travel vs in a hotel.  The Living suites Toronto is mostly a residential building with some 'hotel' suites for short term stays.  The apartment is modernly furnished with everything one would need to feel at home including a stove and partial cooking setup (except for a kitchen knife) washer dryer combo and dishwasher.  However, no soap included for the applicances!  It's a shame because otherwise the suite pretty much covered all the basis for guest amenities.  The location is awesome - adjacent to the entertainment district and the central business core, but it should be noted that the area around the hotel is very noisy.  Lots of traffic plus my suite overlooked 2 rooftop patios for bars that were open until 2 am or so every night, as well as 5 construction sites (I counted the cranes) not to mention the good old Toronto traffic.  Closing the patio door mutes most of it, but if you're a light sleeper I recommend bringing ear plugs.  I should also mention the the management was very accomodating of my request to check in early, and check out late and the concierges in the building were great too.",

At the reception we received the keys for a different suite respect to the one had been notified us by e-mail.With respect to the third and forth sleeping places, we found very poor the quality of the SOFA and sheets. It is a rudimental way to sleep, we would expect a more functional solution (see pictures).Unfortunately, some other things didn't work well. The wifi did not work well, was very unstable. The washbasing (sink) was clogged and we had to use the plunger continuosly. The pillows and sheets were very dirty.Â We had never seen sheets so dirty.Â In general the quality of the suite is poor (see pictures).We wrote twice to the e-mail of the suite's manager...no answer.After the first night we were so disgusted that we left in advance and booked a room in a hotel to continue our staying in Toronto. The only good thing of the Living Suite Toronto is the location that is very centralÂ Salvatore",

There's no indication on the exterior (270 Wellington) of the building that it has rental units.  We drove around back to a little lane (Mercer Street) off Blue Jays Way, Phoned the contact number, and followed their instructions to enter building lobby and go to security desk (not really a concierge).  I had asked for parking but the management is not good at communication so none was reserved for me and the desk personnel only hand out and receive keys.  Anyway, a paid lot ($15 overnight or $35 for 24 hours) is on Mercer.  Security signed me in and gave me a key and electronic fob that opens the exterior door and a hallway door to the elevators,  Room was as advertised and was very similar to what we get from RCI. Bedroom was small and the mattress was really bouncy.  But full kitchen, washer/dryer, large TV, balcony.  Hardwood floor.  Very nice for price and location.  CN Tower and Ripleys Aquarium within walking distance.  Convenience store at corner.  Wifi included.",

It was as expensive as a hotel at nearly Â£200 a night. However it was quite well worn, with a dirty carpet in the bedroom, a rather horrible shaggy (and quite dirty) rug in the front room and the furniture covered in dust. In addition the doors on the wardrobe were broken, so you couldn't use it, and in any case the wardrobe was filled with bedding. As to the concierge (from whom you have to collect the key), well he has to be the grumpiest, and most unpleasant concierge it has ever been my pleasure to meet - \"I don't get paid for doing this you know'. The washing machine and the drier did, however, work well. Was it worth it? Absolutely not.",

Also you are met on arrival and shown to your apartment and was also allowed access to the apartment from 11am. This was really good as it allowed us to explore Toronto for most of the day. Much appreciated.Location wise the apartment block was easy to find and 2 blocks from the Gardner Expressway. Directly across the road was the CN Tower and Rodgers Centre. We used the City Sightseeing Tour to get around and there was a stop just around the corner. A subway stop was several blocks east.Most of the popular areas were to the north and east and walkable if you are able. If not transport was good.

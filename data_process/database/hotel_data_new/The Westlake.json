Booked a room for three people on March 26th 2023 for a suite with two queen beds for Sept 19-20 through Hotels.com. Got in today.. September 19th 2023. Received a one bed room. Not a suite, a very small room. I called the contact number provided and the woman who answered was very rude. Seemed extremely annoyed I was calling, told me management would be in touch I asked when and she said \"when they get in touch\"20 minutes later the manager calls and basically says \"that sucks\" but I booked through a 3rd party and it's not there issue but then told me if I couldn't make the room work I was welcome to leave because I was getting money back anyway. Now I'm in a city I'm not familiar with, one bed, three grown adults  The room was filthy. Stains on the blankets and the rug hadn't been cleaned or even vacuumed in ages. There was hair all over the bathroom and it smelled very strongly of smoke. There were cigarette burns all across the curtains. The fridge smelled and was sticky. Got a hold of Hotels.com. They tried to reach out to the manager of the hotel and they were hung up on multiple times. Needless to say we left. Please be careful before considering this hellhole.",

There were numerous minor issues, the shower leaks into the hallway, the was no coffee maker in the room, the towel rack had broken off in the bathroom... We didn't mind any of these things, as we understand that this happens over time. We slept, and had no complaints. There was no noise, the bed was comfortable, the pillows are fine.

We stayed in the Cornerstone Suite (stunning), but you can't go wrong with names like \"Bye, Felicia!\" and \"Netflix and Chill\"!The staff (led by hotel manager, Andy) are friendly, extremely helpful, and were clearly on a mission to make our stay memorable - thanks guys!  The few questions we had were answered quickly and efficiently.The location was close enough to downtown that we had great access to our events, but also just far enough out that we got to enjoy walks along the lake and relaxing at the nearby park by the lake.Parking was a little challenging at first, but again, hotel manager Andy helped us out with some local knowledge.Overall, a top experience, and unlike any place we've ever stayed...highly recommended.Chris & Martyna",

      "title": "Great for locals wanting a getaway, or for travellers",
      "text": "We live in the city but booked this more as a get-away. In short, this is a great find within Toronto that I wish I had found sooner. I would recommend this for both travellers as well as locals who are looking to get away.   Here are my specific comments - stayed in the \"Noire suite\"1.  The location is right on a streetcar line on Lakeshore. We didn't take it but it looks like it would be around a 30 min commute to get to/from downtown, and TTC line 1.  There is a also a Shopper's Drug Mart, Tim Horton's, LCO  and a few restaurants nearby so that travellers from out of town could easily walk to get groceries, liquor and coffee.2. \"check in\" was easy. I was sent codes for the front door, the door leading to the suites themselves, and the actual suite, the night before.  3. Our suite was extremely clean. It was equipped with glasses, plates, pots, pans, utensils. It had a microwave, sink, toaster fridge (I had trouble finding it as first because from the outside it looks like a dishwasher), and a cooktop that says it is for \"warming up\" only.  We didn't try to cook in there, but I suspect you would be able to cook some basic things like eggs, microwavable meals, breakfast stuff etc.  It had a bench area where 4-5 people could eat.   This fits with the AirBNB concept it advertises itself to be.4. Our suite seemed quiet. We didn't hear anything from outside nor other guest although I don't know how full it was the night we stayed. Of note, there is language written in the facility that no partying is allowed. HOw they enforce that is unclear.5. Unlike a traditional hotel, I didn't see a front desk where someone is physically located. However the manager/owner did supply a phone number to call/text if needed. We never had to do it so can't comment on responsiveness.6.  The suite we stayed in was very nicely decorated, like one would consider decorating their own place.7.  Temperature control seemed to work well.8. My only semi-negative comment is that with the Noire Suite, there really isn't any place to keep clothers. They provide some hangers that hang from piping (that is likely decoration rather than functional), to hold around 10 items of clothing. There is also one of those things to rest a suitcase. This might be an issue with this particularly suite if you are staying a while and have a decent amount of clothes.In short, we would VERY HIGHLY recommend this to people coming from out of town. It is on my list of places to try if looking for a place away from home for a small get together or to go back to after a night out.  It is a very reasonable trip from here to downtown whether it is via public transportation as I described above, or Uber (looks to be around a $20-25 uber ride to downtown).  For people coming into town to see a show or sports game, this is a very comfortable and MUCH more affordable option than staying downtown. The only downside is that if you want to be right in the middle of the action and crowds, this is not for you because it is located west of downtown.",

I‚Äôve stayed here (Noire suite) a few times and enjoy how secluded and cozy it is.

Super cozy room with kitchenette which is awesome for longer stays. LCBO nearby. Not close to downtown but if you choose to stay here there is a streetcar that will take you there.

I dropped off everything to them the morning of and they set it all up in the room for us before we returned from dinner. We had excellent service. I asked for an iron and an ironing board and it was there so quick I could hardly believe it! I would stay there again in a heartbeat. Granted, it is a bit expensive but worth every last dollar. It's the kind of room in which you can't help but feel romantic and frisky. Well, it didn't work for me ;-) but it can for the rest of you! All in all, an excellent place. I give it two thumbs up...way up. I thought the service would be bad and the employees snotty but they were all very polite. They let me check in early (11am) and were very helpful - Enjoy your stay!",

      "text": "Super Cute! We loved our stay here. It was our first time and will go back. The rooms are clean and comfortable, the bathrooms are spacious. Our shower had two shower heads. The beds are comfy and theres california shutters to keep the light away in the morning. It was a nice touch to have a full kitchen there with a coffee maker, a toaster and we also had a fridge in our room. We were able to have brunch one morning (this place called ‚ÄòSchool‚Äô in Liberty Village. Its not an actual school but their blueberry flapjacks are delic!) And we made breakfast for the other two mornings in our room. The check in took us a minute and there is parking behind the hotel. Excellent hotel for those travelling from out of the country as you have the comfort of your home and it makes for a great long stay. P.S. Theres a drug mart and grocery store right outside, maybe a 10 second walk.",

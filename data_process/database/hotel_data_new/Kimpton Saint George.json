  "description": "The aesthetic of Kimpton Saint George brings to mind Torontoâ€™s heritage of craftsmanship and its evolving identity as a dynamic modern hub. Authentic flourishes, like custom art and furniture pieces from local artists and artisans, illustrate the distinctive identity (with a touch of irreverence) that makes Torontonians and travelers alike fall hard for the city. In each of our 188 guestrooms, including 20 suites and one Presidential Suite, weâ€™ve created a haven for our guests meant to evoke the neighbourhoodâ€™s heritage residences. Clever touches, like carefully layered collected sculptural furnishings, complement a soothing palette of moody blues, greens and grays juxtaposed with warmer tones. It all comes together to create a visual narrative that immerses guests in elements of true Toronto.",

      "text": "My family and I stayed at the Kimpton St George Hotel to celebrate the holidays with our children who live in Toronto. Before arriving I spoke with David on the phone and mentioned that I was experiencing a minor health concern. When I arrived, Mary at the Front Desk asked if I were feeling better and suggested a room that might help make my stay more comfortable. Once settled into my room, I required the services of both Housekeeping and Maintenance. Each of the respective people came to my room and was professional, courteous and helpful. The only complaint I have is that the bathroom door did not close properly and there was no lock on the bathroom door. I would have also liked a coffee machine in the room.My husband took advantage of the complimentary wine bar from 5 to 6 pm. He enjoyed that very much.Our room was quiet, clean and the beds were very comfortable. The curtains were well fitted to the windows so as to block all street lights if desired. In the morning, we ate Breakfast in the hotel restaurant and Monica was our server. She had a relaxed way and made us feel at home. Our breakfast was delicious and there was lots of food. Our teenage son was very happy with his pancakes with strawberries and whipped cream. Definitely something he does not get at home!Later that morning my university son joined me for coffee and found that the ambiance was very much suited to talking and that the music was easy to listen to but not too loud. He said that he will consider meeting university friends there as he thought it would be a great spot. Our whole family enjoyed the convenience of the location of the Kimpton St George hotel. We had such a great stay that we look forward to staying again soon when we celebrate some big family events later this winter.",

The team at Saint George was incredibly accommodating as we were also bringing our cat with us. I know the hotel is pet-friendly, but they went above and beyond, providing a litterbox, fresh litter and scoop for us. We were a bit nervous to stay anywhere other than our home during the pandemic, but I felt totally safe and well taken care of at the hotel. I saw on the website they had protocols in place and the room was super clean (and stylish). Everyone had masks in the common spaces and extra care was even taken during payment with handing off my credit card. The front desk also checked in via text if we needed anything. It was great. I couldn't have asked for a better stay during a pretty stressful time.",

The pictures turned out amazing because of the many beautiful and diverse areas for photos. We also spent 3 nights in their \"King Deluxe\" room and we couldn't have asked for a better room. Beautiful living room area, super soft bed, and the nicest bathroom I've ever seen. Everything in the hotel was clean and followed all the COVID protocols. We definitely felt safe being there during the pandemic since everyone was wearing a mask at all times and the hotel was absolutely spotless. The total cost was also very affordable, especially considering the cost of other potential wedding venues. There are also so many restaurants in the area, with lots of variety from different cultures. Finally, the best thing was the staff. WOW. They were extremely helpful during the wedding planning process, they allowed us to be there a day early to set everything up, emailed us always to double check on our plans/timeline. The cherry on top was when they brought us some treats to our room after the wedding. All in all, my wife and I couldn't have asked for a better place to get married and spend our pandemic honeymoon.",

      "text": "Choosing the Kimpton St. George for our anniversary celebration was the best decision we couldâ€™ve made. We wanted to have a little staycation and my partnerâ€™s only requirement is that we got a tub. So we booked the 1 bedroom suite for the tub. The entire suite was thoughtfully designed and the record player was an added touch. The washroom for the record, had rainfall shower and the really nice tub seen in pictures on the website. The robes were also really comfy might I add. My only criticism is the lighting in the suite was not optimal for taking photos whatsoever haha. But thatâ€™s my harshest criticism which isnâ€™t even a real criticism haha. Our check in experience was stellar. We showed up at 3pm and told Dave (thanks for the hospitality Dave!) it was our anniversary as he told us about free wine hour. He offered to send us a bottle of wine to the room. After a few minutes I was told there might be a little bit of a wait to turn over a suite and to enjoy a complimentary drink at the hotel bar (which Iâ€™ve been to before and do recommend! Really good eats too!). It was really no problem and as we were about to head over we were told our room was actually ready so that worked out. As soon as we got up and took our coats off someone came by with the bottle of wine! How lovely!! I then got a text from Dave that if we needed anything to feel free to text them instead. Which is really nice seeing as I when Iâ€™m travelling phone calls cost as texts do not. The hotel itself is situated in a pretty nice area with tons of nicer restaurants appropriate for our anniversary plans. Itâ€™s also right by St. George TTC which is really good for those who plan on using subway (itâ€™s a cross section of 2 subway lines).We did order breakfast on the door knocker for the following morning and it was 100% the right choice. Breakfast came hot and was perfectly cooked. They also gave us late check out (2pm) which was greatly appreciated. In summary, beautiful suite, good location,  and the best staff ever! Thanks so much Kimpton ðŸ˜Š",

We were not disappointed at all...We were greeted by friendly front desk staff and absolutely loved our room! The bed is probably the most comfortable Iâ€™ve ever slept on and the room was spotless. Any decorative pillows were removed for safety and the couch smelled like it was just cleaned. You can tell that this property is taking their COVID-19 cleaning measures seriously, which I definitely appreciated. Also, the wine hour in the lobby was such a nice touch along with the coffee in the morning. We even asked to borrow an HDMI cable to watch a movie and it was at our door in minutes. Will definitely be returning in the future! Really great service.",

Aside from the cleanliness from the hand sanitizer to the plexiglass at the front desk, they went above and beyond by offering a welcome package at arrival with a mask, sanitizer, gloves and alcohol wipes. So smart.  We are in a pandemic so why not make your guests more comfortable the minute they arrive?Within seconds of checking in I had a text from Mary at the front desk suggesting I contact her if there was anything she could do to improve my stay. The overnight staff at the desk were also incredible, offering to keep their eyes on my car parked out front during the night.  The room was spotless, the staff fantastic and my one night stay felt like a vacation. I will come back again and again thanks to the personal service from Mary and her team. Running a hotel during a pandemic must present many obstacles, but the Kimpton St. George has found the opportunities and itâ€™s about making the guests feel special. I am so impressed.",

Nothing spared, and a well manicured boutique experience. They were limited in what they could offer in terms of food and beverage on account of the pandemic guidelines, but coffee service in the morning was appreciated and I've happily eaten at the on-site restaurant as a local (gastropub with a good menu and great value).

We had been working with the concierge Nabeel to make our reservations and he was able to extend our stay at the hotel with no problem.The location of the hotel is great for exploring the city and is right next to the campus of the University of Toronto.  Due to some COVID restrictions, the restaurant in the hotel did not serve breakfast, but the hotel had an arrangement with a local restaurant to provide breakfast for us each morning and would deliver it directly to our room.  There was a coffee and tea station in the lobby that was perfect for us.The room was spacious enough for both my wife and I to work for 3 days with no issues.  The wifi was fast and reliable - we both were able to conduct several meetings from our room.  The bed was very comfortable and the bathroom very clean.  The best part of our stay was the service we received.  Everyone at the front desk was very friendly and willing to help us in any way they could.  The concierge Nabeel was especially helpful.  He was able to direct us to a testing facility for our COVID tests needed to re-enter the US as well as recommending dinner/lunch spots for us.  He even arranged for a car service to take us back to the airport at 3:45am for our 6am flight.We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and will be coming back for our next visit to Toronto!",

I was greeted by someone at the desk, everything was very professional but it seemed a bit off,  almost cold, maybe understaffed.  We had to park in a very, very shady parking structure that looked like it was going to fall apart or your car may go missingâ€¦ I was not fond of this at all.  There was no valet service, strange for the clientele this hotel attracts, but dollar didnâ€™t fit the bill.The hotel is kind of cool, it has organically art decorating the walls and that is very pleasing.  We got the the room and it was nice, it lived up to the notion of boutique.  I donâ€™t know what to say other than I liked it!  I loved the bathroom until you tried the shower on and it sprayed all over the floor, they need waterfall shower heads, they only have a half glass wall half open, so it would be better personallyâ€¦ but towels caught the over spray and puddles.One thing I did not like at all was I had to go down to get coffee, I was not impressed, I know itâ€™s covid and itâ€™s an reason for everything, but it was a big deal for me.The bed was decent, it did what it was supposed to, provide a good nights sleep!I am glad I stayed, but I donâ€™t think I would go hear a second time, but happy I stayed once!",

I've had rave reviews from my team who stayed there about the beautiful rooms, how clean they were kept, the on-point change of keys first thing in the morning on Wednesday, March 6, due to breaking up the reservation to get a better price point (world-wide conference at the first part of their 6-daystay), the service by all staff, and the wonderful lobby wine, which was free and greatly appreciated by my team after a long day of travelling and meetings.

We went along to the free wine tasting in the lobby on our first night there. It was nice to have access to iced water throughout day in the lobby also.",

The included parking with the package deal was a bonus. Unfortunately the room was incredibly underwhleming. IHG portrays Kimpton as their special, high end, unique property. We were excited to stay here for the first time. The hotel was reviewed on the Air Canada in flight system. It's not hard to tell these are paid testimonials as the review did NOT match the actual experience. The room and bathroom was VERY basic, tiny and had very few ammenities. The mini fridge had a small of the food that the prior guest(s) had - but the room itself was the issue. The experience didn't ruin our stay but it left us disappointed from the second we walked in to the time we checked out. Other than a  compfortbale bed, if this is what the Kimpton brand is we're not staying at another one. We'd never stay here again. If you choose to stay be sure to set your expectations appropriately low versus the glossy reviews and recommendations.",

Because we were getting married during COVID, and a bit nervous about staying in a hotel, Sean made us feel at ease, and really personalized our service. The hotel itself is stylish, and great for some photos. We stayed in a suite, and were shocked by how large it was. The trendy furniture felt very Art Deco, and everything was spotless. Our favorite part was the bathroom, which had a giant soaker tub and Malin+Goetz toiletries (the best!). They even threw in a bottle of bubbly given the whole COVID wedding thing :)",

Although the hotel has been decorated with stylish fixtures and a pleasant decor it is like putting lipstick on a pig. This hotel has low ceilings, is dark and just feels â€˜dampâ€™. After doing some research this used to be a Holiday Inn which makes so much sense.The bones of the building are not great, but the room layout was very sad. It was like being on a room on a cruise ship - one basic rectangle with one window and zero character. I expect more for Kimptons who either go for new build or character building. At 350$ a night this was unacceptable. The service levels here were also poor. I had just arrived from Vancouver where every person I interacted with with happy, friendly and social. Not at the Kimpton. Would not recommend. Stay elsewhere.",

      "text": "We stayed here for 3 nights during our second stint in Toronto on our 2 week holiday in Canada. We stayed at 5 other hotels/airbnbs during our stay in Canada and despite being the most expensive, this definitely wasnâ€™t the best place that we stayed. We ended up staying in a different room every night of our stay - our first room hadnâ€™t been cleaned properly (most notably someone elseâ€™s hairs left in the shower tray), it was noisy (faced the road despite asking for a quiet room) and the air con didnâ€™t work properly meaning it came on and off constantly throughout the night. In addition, the charge held on our credit card was C$200 more than expected. As compensation we were moved to a junior suite and the charge for our late check out was removed - this was great for the second night until 2 guests moved into the room next door. As the rooms were adjoining I could hear their conversations word for word (I found it odd that a room deemed to be a â€˜suiteâ€™ would be adjoining with another room). I again complained about noise and this time we were moved to a suite. I feel the management team, David in particular, handled the situation well and I didnâ€™t leave the hotel feeling annoyed, but I think itâ€™s fair to share my experience for the benefit of others. If youâ€™re looking for a quiet hotel, this probably isnâ€™t the one for you (we realised, having checked in, that this building used to be a Holiday Inn and despite the aesthetic refurbishment, the fabric of the hotel remains the same). I should also note that the hotel parking (self parking, not valet) is extortionate at C$36 per night!",

From housekeeping to restaurant staff, we felt welcomed and enjoyed our interactions with everyone. The location and room decor was also lovely. I liked the fact that we're somewhat close to the city center but we were still able to have a quiet night of rest. During Covid times, we also pay extra attention to the cleanness of the room and this hotel certainly did not disappoint us. Ps. If you're looking for not just a vacation getaway but also a place to work remotely, I highly recommend this hotel. I could take a work zoom call and teach online with nice background and lighting throughout this stay without any problem :)",

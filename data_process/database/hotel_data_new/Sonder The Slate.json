The location I selected was quite noisy because of construction - ear plugs are provided and I was out of the room early so the impact to me was minimal but if you were planning on spending a lot of time in the room that may be an issue.  The room is clean and well designed - great wifi and you connect to ROKU with your own streaming accounts which was simple.  The amenities provided are good - coffee, tea, shower products but there are no items such as glassware or cutlery.  One other note is that parking in the area runs about $30/day and the lots are not on an app so it means running out to pay parking at 6:00 a.m or risk a ticket.",

      "text": "I was very excited when I was booking this place, based on the pictures and the location (in hindsight, I should have taken some time and read through some of the reviews). I wanted to treat myself to a 2 night stay in the city, and based on what I saw on the site, this seemed like the perfect place. A massive king size bed, a huge tub, and cool modern interior design. How exciting right?Well, the excitement didn‚Äôt last that long after staying there for a few hours.For the price you were paying, It seemed like I should be getting competitive service. But no, everything is an up charge, even cleaning service??? Now I may have missed this when booking, but really?I asked for fresh towels, toothpaste, and toothpaste, the bot chat system that they have told me I could only have one service call for my stay, but they would send my request shortly. I talked to 5 different people and they all said the same thing, \"items will be there soon\"Well, I never got them! One other thing that was a huge turn off, was the strong dirty odor inside the toilet. The concept of the toilet is cool, with frosted glass and a massive door opening. But, there was no switch for a fan, and also no openings for airflow. It felt like the smell had infused itself into the tiles and glass (somehow) from each and every single toilet use over its life time. Definitely not ideal. The switch for bathroom lights was also outside of the bathroom!!! üòëSo I only stayed there for one night, and although the bed seemed nice, it definitely wasn‚Äôt a comfortable bed. Now the funny part, after a disappointing one night stay, I decided to leave and contact customer support to let them know I do not want to continue my stay. They told me I had to cancel three days before my arrival. I booked the night before so there was no way for me to cancel three nights before!! Like how does that policy make sense when I‚Äôm expressing my dissatisfaction? So they didn‚Äôt want to help, and luckily I had booked it through Expedia, which took care of it right away. So overall, definitely won‚Äôt be recommending this to anyone who cares about some of the basic things that one could expect from a hospitality provider.",

      "text": "At a Sonder in downtown Toronto, a warning of noise, earplugs and noise machines had us ask for a room away from the noise. In our expensive 3-room unit, we got 2 rooms away from the noise but our bedroom was literally right in the middle of it, with the construction starting at 6:15am each morning, we asked for a workspace, a desk that didn‚Äôt race a bed. We got one, but it had no power outlets anywhere near it, so it was useless. So was the ‚Äúkitchen‚Äù with no sink anywhere near by, one of the worst coffee machines a tiny dorm fridge and a tiny trash can. Nothing we could really use for a 4-day stay. The room was expensive and an interesting design but finished and maintained poorly. The only reason this stay gets a 2 instead of a 1 is for Sonder‚Äôs customer service and small % refund they issued us to make us feel better. I have stayed at great Sonders in MTL. I expected better.",

      "title": "Very Disappointing",
      "text": "I booked a stay with Sonder as a surprise for my wife's birthday. The contact-less access was handy as we were still dealing with covid restrictions. However upon arriving at our room I came to find that the specific suite I paid extra for because of the size and view it offered had a concrete wall 8 feet from the window. Construction of a new building next door completely blocked our view, we felt very misled. Other minor details that on their own could be looked past was a large stain on the lounge chair and an open pregnancy test in the closet, which left my wife feeling a bit uncomfortable. All of that could have been tolerated but when extremely loud construction began INSIDE the hotel at 8am Saturday morning on our floor and the one above us (this is a small boutique hotel) this really turned our disappointment into frustration. There was no notice of such construction being done in the building and it continued for a number of hours. After this all happened I wrote an email to complain about our very underwhelming experience and after four days I finally heard back with nothing more than a \"Sorry you had a bad experience\" response. All in all this was very discouraging and it's unfortunate because the service has potential to be useful but the oversight on the part of Sonder resulting from a clear disconnect and a total lack of customer service makes me reluctant to ever use them again or do anything but forewarn others against doing so.",

      "text": "I had a lovely two week stay at the Slate. I would say it's a good value for your money, though I must admit I booked long in advance to make sure I had the best price and had a substantial discount because it was a long stay. I have a low budget and I'm usually ok with minimal service. I booked knowing that there was no cleaning service included in the price and I was ok with it. I asked for fresh bedsheets and got them quickly, and I did the bed myself. They always replied promptly when I texted with a question. The room is well-decorated, the view is nice, the bed was confortable and it has a nice bathtub, and a good wifi connection. The building itself was very quiet, however it's on a busy street and there is construction right next to the building, so if you sleep lightly this could be a problem, but it wasn't one for me. I am sure glad that they upgraded me to a brighter room with a view on Adelaide street, because the one I was initially supposed to stay in was facing the construction site and was very dark (literally just a few feet away from a building being built: I think they should have the photos on their website updated to reflect the reality). A few things that could be improved: there was no proper towel rack in the bathroom, I had to use a clothes hanger. A person mentioned in another review that there was no ventilation; there is, but it's controlled through the thermostat panel, which can be a bit counter-intuitive. Maybe they can make it clearer. They could also mention on their website that there is a small fridge in the room. It's in a closet and looks like a safe because there's a key on it. It took me a few days to find out! I would have used it earlier. Also when you book online it would be nice if they would accept ID cards from other provinces. They only accept a passport or a driver's license. I don't drive, so I had to have my passport made (even though I was only coming from Quebec.) Finally, the French translation on their website and app isn't very accurate. They should have a French speaking person verify it, it seems like it was google-translated or something. I am mentioning these things hoping that they can look into it and make it even better :)",

Should you visit this location while construction is underway, ear plug and a white noise machine is in arms reach! I really like that this location is walking distance to some great spots which I visited. A nice 15 minute walk to the CN tower & the Toronto Metro Convention Centre and under 10 mins walk to great restaurants.

Room itself was nice enough, although the bathtub looked extremely uncomfortable and the workmanship could've been better (a few loose fittings). But the reason why this room was terrible and why I will never return, is it has absolutely zero sound proofing. They are clearly aware of this as they leave ear plugs for you, but it's not enough. You can hear when someone in the room above or below you opens and closes their blinds, you can hear people on the street arguing, you can hear the elevator moving through the building, when someone else closes their door it's deafening loud. Like I say, zero sound proofing. If you want to sleep, don't stay here.",

Would be great for a night owls to, but my husband and I went to bed early and had no issues, they included a white noise, machine and complementary earbuds, which was so sweet even without it wasn‚Äôt bad at all. The shower and bathroom were beautiful and everything was very clean, overall one of my best Airbnb stays and honestly a little on the expensive size for the amount of space but nothing too bad will be booking here again.",

      "text": "This is my third stay at this Sonder all for medical reasons. The first two  times due to covid I was forced to stay alone. I was scared and in pain but I needed extra pillows and the service I received was above and beyond. I was even given a hand written note.  This last time I was having spinal surgery and needed an early check in due to needing to quarantine before surgery. I was offered a reasonable check in time that only differed by 30 minutes. I‚Äôm so impressed with Sonder that I may never stay anywhere else. I‚Äôll definitely chose Sonder first. I felt like family. I‚Äôm handicapped and have a brain injury. Everyone was extremely helpful and accommodating to my needs. Thank you again for the handwritten welcome back note too. I was really impressed by that added touch. You don‚Äôt often see that type of service anymore.",

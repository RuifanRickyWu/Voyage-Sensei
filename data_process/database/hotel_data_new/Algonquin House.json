As this is the home of retired teachers, there were plenty of books around, nice bright lighting, and a sitting room with a chaise longue invitingly placed and windows on three sides. Of course, my purpose in TO  was not to read, but this was one excellent feature which makes me want to stay here on my next visit in 2020. Leora was generous too, for she let my sister join me for breakfast--they are both great ballet enthusiasts, and both still very active themselves (my sister going to ballet classes at least three times a week). Another link was that Leora and Mark were both descended from Jews settled near Minsk, whilst we are also of East European Jewish extraction.  Altogether a positive experience, and a place I would unreservedly recommend. Swanriver2016",

The linens and crockery, too, were wonderful. Also, the morning's newspaper lay ready for me at breakfast table - a nice touch. The house is close to many restaurants and little shops in Roncesvalles. It is also a 5 minute walk to the High Park entrance and about a 15-20 minute walk to Keele station.

Breakfasts served were all homemade and she even provided a bag so that I can take some of the baked goodies with me. When I arrived, there was even a slice of cake and some cheese, cherries, and biscuits to welcome me. The house is located in Roncesvalles Village, a quaint neighbourhood with a lot of small shops and restaurants. The house is a 5-minute walk to the nearest streetcar stop and is a short walking distance to High Park.",

Leora, the host, welcomed us and showed us a lovely room with some little appetisers and a glass of wine - what a pleasure to have a short rest then in the Fireplace Room! The room was very nice, the shared bathroom well equipped with everything you need in the morning. And breakfast, how to say, we are still dreaming of the French Toast, mmmhhh!!!",

Breakfast was a treat every morning, making it impossible not to over indulge. The location of the B&B was convenient to High Park, Roncesvalles shopping and public transport. I highly recommend Algonquin house as a place to stay in Toronto.",

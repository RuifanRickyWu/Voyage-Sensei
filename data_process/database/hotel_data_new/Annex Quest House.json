      "text": "I was expecting a bit more from the web site, which proclaims that you will be pampered \"body, mind, and soul.\" Except for some nice smelling soap, that was about the extent of the pampering. The room was furnished interestingly, with walls painted a deep red/purple color, and some nice furniture pieces, but I found the bed to be really hard and for this reason would not return. Room was clean enough, but I found several long hair strands, one on the sheet, one in the tub, in the towels, and in the sink. The copper sink bowl was pretty, but impractical to use.There was a brew and go cup coffeemaker in the room, but when I went to use it, a roach crawled out. Since this is a guest house, not a B&B, no breakfast was served, but there are cafes nearby. When I came back to the inn the first night, granola bars and bottles of water had been left on a table in the hallway, which was a nice touch. I thought I would grab one of each in the morning. However, a noisy group left before me, and took every last one. The next night, none were put out. I was there for two nights and both mornings, very early, a pigeon was roosting and making lots of noise on the window air conditioner. In fact, it kept pecking the accordian fold in the space between the unit and the wall, trying to get in, which was very annoying.The owner checked me in, and I didn't find her too friendly, considering she was the owner and not just a staff person. Location is definitely convenient but I'd stay in a regular B&B and hope for a more comfortable bed the next time.",

No other rooms to change to as this place only has double beds and one or two queen beds (for two).  There is NO breakfast as it is a bed and breakfast.  Protein bars, box juice and tiny boxes of raisens are surely not a breakfast.  We have stayed in B & Bs around the world and this by far is the worst we have stayed in.  What I would do next time?  I would make sure the room would not be on a busy street.  The Price was high for this three night stay.  We could have stayed in the Holiday Inn on Bloor St for $10 to $20 more per night and gone to Tim Hortons for a cheap breakfast.",

      "text": "On arrival we were met by a friendly member of staff and through our stay people we met who worked or owned the place were friendly and polite.The location is very handy for the Spadina subway and streetcar system which is accessed by the building next door. This covers virtually all of Toronto.Unfortunately we found the room facilities did not meet the needs of a traveller. The bed and cleanliness of the room was very good. The d√©cor is nice and the ethos is good .The tired traveller requires more practical and physical needs in a room.1.A sensible sink (this was a trendy beaten copper raised bowl) preferably inside the bathroom with a drainage plug to hold water for washing and shaving. Think of the pure wastage of hot water constantly running for the sacrifice of a trendy looking bowl.2.A large practical mirror to use for shaving and all other uses.The tiny (1x2 foot inside a cupboard) mirror was much too inadequate I'm not sure how people who worry about hairstyles and make up would manage. More than one mirror would have been even better.3. There were only 3 hangers in the room. We had lots of items we wanted to hang up from creasing.If guests were pinching them make sure they are the type that can not be taken.4. When the room is facing on the sunny side in the daytime and towards the street with bright street lighting at night a slack Venetian blind is not enough. Proper drapes are needed. I could read a book at 4am and wear sunglasses in the room in the day.5. The air conditioning unit was badly needed. Our room was in the eaves of the house so was really hot. In preparation for our arrival it had not been turned on and it was like walking into a furnace. We found why it wasn't on when we switched it on ourselves. I think the bearings were worn and it was so loud we couldn't hear the TV above the noise.6.It was a nice idea putting the fridge in the room. I suggest it should standon a piece of insulation as it hummed loudly constantly on the wooden floor. It would have been nice if it had been stocked with some water and juice ready cooled to refresh a hot tired customer. A couple of drinking glasses in the room were needed but we had to manage with a toothbrush mug between us.We stayed at other places in Toronto that got things just right so probably wouldnt go back to this place again.We are very regular travellers all over the world and experienced everything from 5* to hostel and hope these comments are useful and constructive",

      "title": "No frills but well done",
      "text": "I needed to be in Toronto for 2 weeks for business purposes, and so was looking for an inexpensive option to a traditional hotel.  The Annex Quest House was recommended by my colleague at the University of Toronto, and it fit the bill perfectly - it was extraordinarily inexpensive for a 2-week stay, and quite pleasant.  FIrst the warnings - this is definitely a  no-frills place.  No elevator - I had to walk-up to my 3rd floor room, which was tough with my bags but fine during the stay.  The room had a microwave and a tiny fridge into which I could barely fit a few single-serve beverage bottles and small fruit containers, but not much more.  The daily \"cleaning\" service amounted to folding the towels in the bathroom and making the bed, nothing else.  Owing to a bizarre Indian spiritual motif, the sink in the bathroom consisted of a copper pot with a drain at the bottom and no air vent hole, so if the drain was covered the water did not recede - a bit annoying while brushing teeth or washing my face.  Finally, the office was only open from 10-7 daily and nobody was there at all on my first full day there (a Sunday), so it was tough to find people and took me a while to register.  Having said that, though, it was almost perfect for my needs.  The room was spacious and though spartan, it was clean, easy to keep clean, and had free WiFi.  Although there were no junk machines, the staff put out free bottles of water, snacks, extra coffee, extra amenities, and other goodies in the hall such that guests could take as much as they wanted/ needed.  There was a laundry room with free detergent and dryer stuff.  The staff - when they were there, or even when not there and freely accessible by phone - were extraordinarily pleasant, helpful, knowledgeable, and at least in the case of one office attendant on the weekend, very well-educated and nice to talk to.  The best thing was the location - it was a two block walk to one of the main restaurant drags in Toronto, replete with every kind of Asian or Middle Eastern food that you might want, as well as more traditional fare, and supermarkets, mini-markets, a bread bakery, several coffee-shops, and lots of fresh fruit/ veggie stands.  It was awesome.  It is also a short walk to China town, Korea town, the Opera house, several museums, and the University of Toronto main campus, and for me a 30 minute walk to the Medical Center downtown.  ALthough I never used it, there is a small train station next door to the hotel and a bigger one (also a bus depot) two blocks away.  All this despite the fact that you're in the middle of a very pleasant residential neighborhood.  This, all in all, thumbs up.",

I own my own business and won't justify spending additional money on extra amenities that I don't have time to use. If I was traveling with my family on an occasional week or weekend and needed extra amenities I would gladly pay the extra dollars for my family's benefit.I am a man of simple needs and of high expectations. I expect the inn to be clean and it's impeccably clean. I expect it to be quiet and it's very quiet. I need internet and there's internet. I need parking and there's parking. I'm also grateful for the friendly staff that greets you with a smile as well as the refreshments like coffee, beverages and snacks that are replenished throughout the day. The inn is also literally on the other side of the driveway to the subway line. If my timing is right, I've made it to the entertainment district in 12 minutes via the subway. Having said that, with my frequency of business trips and even the occasional recreational visit to Toronto I would rather spend my money in an establishment where I feel I get an exceptional value. To me the Annex Quest House delivers just that. I've lost track of how many years I've been staying there. In my opinion, it's the best pound for pound accommodation value in Toronto.",

The location is outstanding, with a subway station right next door.  I rented a car so purchased on-site parking and for most of my stay, mine was the only car in the lot.  For the last weekend (during TIFF) the lot was full but the management had assigned stalls, which was appreciated.  The room was tastefully decorated (in the Vastu design) and clean.  It was small, with one chair and a folding table that you had to put up when you wanted to use it, but overall very comfortable.  There is a fridge, microwave, and coffee maker in the room.  I ran the air conditioning at night and had no trouble sleeping.  My room was on the third floor, which did involve a lot of stairs but the assistant manager carried my suitcase up.  I checked in on a holiday and it was no problem coordinating that.  Overall, it was a very pleasant stay.",

What we found was an inn with about 15 rooms and absolutely no breakfast.  The look of the rooms from the website is a clean Indian feel with warm colored walls and lovely tapestries.  The room we were given had this look, but the bed was poor.  The mattress was only about 4-5 inches thick with some mysterious springs or something making it lumpy.  The room was dimly lit and the tiny mirror above the sink had doors on it that basically closed it off.  I suppose this was ambiance, but for me I wondered if I had applied makeup appropriately or had toothpaste on me.  Finally, the room had a desk in it, but neither my friend at 6'2\" or little me at 5'6\" could properly sit at the desk to use our computer.  There were some nice touches.  Each day a snack bowl was filled for guests to treat themselves (mostly breakfast bars) and they kept a steady supply of bottled water.  The innkeepers seemed nice, but we rarely saw them, due to our itenerary.  Finally, the location is extremely convenient as it is next to a Subway station, but not a very busy one, so it is not loud.",

I was a bit concerned having read a good few suboptimal reviews here but was pleasantly surprised!It's not somewhere you feel very pampered but I don't think it's really what they're aiming for.  They say it's Vastu inspired.  It felt more like an upscale hostel in a way-but in a positive sense!The welcome was pleasant and I was shown to my room on the 3rd floor.   The girl who greeted me offered to help with my bag and gave me a quick tour as we went. I was glad I'd left my big suitcases in the B&B I was spending the rest of my time in-there was no way I could have taken them up the steep narrow staircase.  The room was pretty basic but open and spotless.  Firm queen bed, big dresser, some hooks on the wall and a tiny TV.  I liked having a coffee maker, microwave and fridge.  The bathroom was also spotless with a copper sink and small tub.  Tea, coffee and granola bars were provided in the room with more in the lobby downstairs.It's pretty much a self service experience.  No staff are on site after 7pm although there's an emergency number to ring.  There's no breakfast-extra granola bars and some oatmeal packets are left downstairs but they weren't replenished until I was almost ready to check out.  The location is good though at Spadina/Bloor and literally next door to the Spadina North subway station.

From the onset, I was impressed with the email correspondence I had with the manager and I was able to ask questions about the room set up and the location. I was on a research trip that lasted for 3 weeks so it was important that  I would get a comfortable and friendly establishment and this certainly was the one. My room was on the 4th floor, in the corner. Very spacious, large bed, big window to the front, clean bathroom, a lovely writing desk with internet connection, worktop, fridge, coffee maker and microwave. The rooms are checked on a daily basis (garabage emptied and towels changed if requested) and cleaned on the weekend. There is plenty of complimentary bottled water downstairs as well as teas, coffees, cup-a-soup, granola bars and cookies. These are replenished daily. Toronto is a very busy city and I am happy that I did not choose a hotel on the main street (Bloor st) because the noise of traffic, ambulance, fire engines etc... is continuous. Traffic does not stop here. Instead this hotel is on the junction of Bloor and Spadina, 2 blocks from the main street and this is important if, like me, you dislike noise. There is an entrance to the subway next to the entrance of the hotel and the main subway station is on the junction of Boor/Spadina. I don't think there could have been a better location for my stay. From my hotel, I can walk to China Town, Korea Town, Younge street, the Royal Ontario Museum, the Royal Conservatory etc... Public transport is amazing in this city and very cheap so if you walk too far you could always come back by streetcar or subway which will get you very close to the hotel. One of the best perks of this establishment is the laundry facilities. In the basement, there is a laundry room with very clean washing machine and dryer ($3.25 for complete wash) that came in handy. The best aspect of this place is its calm and quiet \"aura\" and Incredibly helpful manager with lots of advice when needed and requested. I have no complaints and I'm full of praise for this place. I DO NOT RECOMMEND it for people travelling with children or for those who require constant attention such as room service and concierge-type services. There is no elevator but there are plenty of rooms on the ground floor.",

      "text": "If you want to stay in the Annex and enjoy small, unique hotels/guesthouses, you should consider this Vastu-designed hotel located on Spadina Road. I found it online and was intrigued by the design principles used in the hotel (search Vastu): my room was called Vayu, its design based on the element of air. The staff were lovely, the atmosphere comfortable and quiet. I was able to purchase high-speed Internet for the length of my stay. Tea, coffee, bottled water, and a variety of healthy snacks were always available free of charge. The hotel is in an older brick house located right beside the Spadina subway station, and it is a short walk from Bloor where there is a wonderful vegetarian restaurant (Fresh), a natural foods store (Noah's), and a variety of other shopping opportunities. It is also close to U of T, the ROM, and the Bata Shoe Museum. I have already recommended this hotel to a friend, who is planning her stay there in the middle of January.",

Right beside a subway station exit, it's convenient to downtown and only about an hour from Pearson Airport on public transit ($3 cash).  Rooms are small, done in smart Vastu style (pick your element), with cable TV, a small fridge and microwave, and coffee/tea/bottled water/snacks provided.  Platform beds are firm.The staff keep the rooms and hallways impeccably clean and well-maintained: you could eat off virtually any surface in the entire establishment.My only suggestion would be to make the Bell Datavalet free, but even at CA$5++/day, it's a bargain.",

Subway station is just beside the building and you do not get to hear or feel the train. Very quiet and relaxing place. Walking distance to grocery store and cafes and restaurants. Service was excellent! Bottles of water, fruit basket, and snacks for late night craving. A very nice touch! It was a wonderful trip. The Asian manager was very polite and friendly.A nice place to be in the city but not have the noise and crowd from the city.",

It is like a B&B but without the feeling that you are in someone else's home.We were surprised at how quiet the room was being it's located right on Spadina. Most importantly we found our room to be very clean. If you are looking for a all the amenities that a large hotel has then this is not the place for you. But I recommend it for anyone who is looking for a nice clean, quiet, place to unwind a and sleep while in Toronto. Also if you go on the balcony for a break late at night you will find the racoons to be friendly and entertaining.",

The rooms are cute and the location is so convenient. One downside was the noisy air-conditioning unit which was needed as the weather was very warm. Highly recommend this place for a stay in Toronto.",

Unfortunately, this amounted to little more than a few plants, beveled corners, some quaint Indian furnishings and a few hanging tapestries.  There is NO guest lounge, the 'breakfast' of granola bars were sometimes not in the basket, my garden room was dark and musty, the walls were too thin allowing every sound nearby to be heard (including a woman next door who was practicing her speech in the middle of the night).  Not very comfortable nor good for my soul, I'm afraid.  Its location, right next to a subway station is okay, but it wasn't really worth staying here (especially the garden/basement rooms -- the ones above might have been nicer).",

We barely had enough room for our luggage and had to squeeze by the luggage to get into the bathroom.  There was one bar of soap over our two days, which we transferred from bathtub to sink frequently.This is the first time I have ever been to a b & b or hotel that did not have a hair dryer.  Upon calling the manager who lives off site, it was apparent that I would not have access to a hair dryer before I had to leave for the day.  One was provided for the second day.The towels weren't changed each day, nor were the coffee maker and cups washed.I guess for a minimalist who doesn't care about the above things, this place is fine, but for close to $200 for two days, we found it lacking.The location is the main selling point and if it had the other amenities, we would stay there again, but not given our first experience.",

TV didn't work, stovetop didn't work and when we requested help we were ignored. We were left 1.5 rolls of toilet paper for 2 people for 4 days on the last night ran out. No one ever brought more despite being told we didn't have enough the day we arrived and no one ever came to fix anything despite reaching out daily. On final day called and was avoided and passed off for 1 week before they offered us a PITIFUL $50 refund and 20% off next stay - as if I would ever stay again. Now they have still not sent the credit to me despite me sending my e transfer information and are back to ghosting my texts and calls. Amenities were out of order, which we didn't find out until the day we arrived and they tried to charge us an additional 59$/ day for parking if you couldn't find street parking!Stay at your own risk! customer service is non existent and they will not provide you with the most basic amenities.",

Very deceptive to get your money without any way of getting it back. Ask to speak to somebody there and all they tell you somebody will be in touch. Itâ€™s been over a week. Pay a little more and know what you are actually getting.",

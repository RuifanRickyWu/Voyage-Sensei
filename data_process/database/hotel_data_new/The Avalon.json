      "text": "We stayed at the Avalon for 4 nights in July 2016. We found the hotel fine and it's very close to one of the subway stations too. The instructions for gaining entry all worked fine and the hotel is keyless which was helpful. The hotel is in a converted house and has loads of character, some real care and attention has gone into designing it. The room was on the first floor and was decorated nice. It had a little kitchen with fridge and microwave, plus plates etc. There was also a TV and air conditioning. The rooms are generally fine, however the issue we had was with the bathroom as it isn't a sealed room and the door doesn't actually close, so you can see and hear anything that might happen in there. This caused a little logistical issue at times but we found a way around it. Also generally you can hear everything else that goes on in the house. The sound really travels from room to room and around the corridors too. It was clean and tidy and had a good location so generally we were happy with it. However the above points did just knock it down a little for us. There is also a supermarket nearby, plus a place for breakfast and the place has WiFi.",

It's quite easy to reach by public transport. Sherbourne station on subway line 2 is only a 2-minute walk from the studio. Supermarket is also around the corner.A few days before arrival you receive instructions with codes to checkin. Worked perfectly! The studio itself was pretty small but had everything you need: A good bed, great shower, big tv (didnt use it), microwave etc. Only thing i missed a bit was a good chair to sit on plus a small table. I had my dinner sitting on the bed. But i'm not complaining, i would recommend this place to everyone!",

They stayed in the \"Kelly Suite\". My mum calls it the dungeon. To start with they asked the cleaner to show them how to work the washing machine. You insert 6 quarters and use as normal she said. She did not explain that there is a drawer to pull out to get your money back, is your maid taking money from every guest who stays? Doesn't seem like much but for a few guests every single day it would be quite the tip jar. The room was dirty even after the cleaner had just left. The tv didnt work. One of the chairs in the room was broken. They heard scurrying in the roof above them at night obviously rats or something. The room was so sloped and tiny that my dad couldn't stand upright. All in all it very close to ruined my mums holiday. DO NOT STAY HERE.",

      "text": "With hotel prices very high in Toronto, I booked this apartment for three nights. The Avalon is a 45 minute walk away from downtown or 20 minutes by public (line 1) transport. It all started well. I had an early flight, so arrived at the apartment at 2 pm knowing that check-inn wasnâ€™t till 4 oâ€™clock. But the entrance code to the building send to me by mail worked, so I entered and went up two narrow stairs (I carried only a small bag, but these stairs will certainly be difficult to navigate with larger bags) to see if I could drop off my bag and head into the city. I was met by a lady who was cleaning my room ((Kelly Studio) and she reminded me that check-inn wasnâ€™t till four (fair enough), but let me drop-off my bag anyway and even was kind enough to show me around the room and bathroom and explain how everything worked. Room and bathroom were clean and large enough, but because this room was in the attic with a sometimes very low ceiling decending, space was limited. I thanked the lady for the tour and went into the city. This was the last time I encountered any of the staff during my stay. Upon return, I noticed that some of the wood of the bed supporting the mattress was lose. I send a mail to the same address that I had received my instructions from and a separate text to the telephone number in this mail asking the staff to fix this. But I never got any reply. I have stayed in apartments without a reception before, but the staff there always could be reached. Not so at the Avalon. I ended up having to get down on the floor and repair the bed myself. The apartment showed some signs of wear and tear and the floor board is in desparate need of a lick of paint. The building is old, made of wood and therefore badly insulated, so any noise can be heard. In the night I could hear animals (rodents?) walking above me. Ammenities like television, airconditioning and shower were working alright. There is free Wi-Fi, but the signal is weak and I had to connect my device again and again to use it. A couple of times my neighbours woke me up in the mjddle of the night with loud music and shouting. Inconsiderate guests are everywhere, but the absence of staff means that they can not be corrected. Fortunately there wasnâ€™t an emergency, because there is no call back after leaving a voice mail message and no one replies when you send a text or e-mail. If you run a business, you should have some way of being available to your customers. The staff at the Avalon is not.",

      "text": "I booked this room months in advance and they gave me the worst room in the building in the attic  with inclined ceilings, the whole area was smaller than the other rooms, there was no space to take a shower, water was always on the floor, the bathroom sink is so tiny you cannot even wash your face, you are going to get all wet on your feet. Wi-Fi and the shower was out of function for few days and when I asked the owner if heâ€™s going to give me any rebate for that, he never answered back. Vicky is the one in charge on the property looking like a psycho. They donâ€™t provide extra towels unless you provide the reason why!! I felt like a child controlled by his mean parents or a Prisoner.  Location wise it is 30 minutes walk from Eaton Center. I killed two insects in the room, one of them was a big spider and the owner told me itâ€™s normal because itâ€™s an old building. He claimed he told Vicki to send me spray to kill the insects but I never had any delivered.  The owner was nice enough to provide me late check out though. They hang from the ceiling a huge big TV over the bed so if you donâ€™t like to have anything hanging on the wall while sleeping this is not the place for you.  I cut my finger as opening the door with their bad location of lock and  door knob, I let them know, they did not do anything about it.  So if I was you I would stay somewhere else .I attached few pics so you see the quality of the room.",

I booked to stay at this property on booking.com and unfortunately had to cancel my travel plans. I called them to cancel my plans in advance and their refund policy stated that I should receive most of my money back by cancelling prior to the date of check-in. They still charged my credit card the full amount, and I am now involved in a dispute to get my money back as they lie and pretend that I never cancelled though their agent confirmed it directly over the phone several times. They do not answer phone calls, and seem to have some random shady agents working for them. There seems to be miscommunication among whoever is working there. Whenever I have spoken with them over the phone, they have no customer service skills and it seems to be some random guy whose name shows up on my call log like he is calling me from his own cell phone. I don't even think they are a true company. There are much more reputable and trustworthy places to stay with much better customer service.

      "text": "4 stars for the very convenient location (2 min walk to metro station, eateries and grocery store) and room facilities eg. kitchenette. But one star knocked off for the ill-fitting bed.Stayed 3 nights in a standard studio (Brando) on the 3rd (top) floor at Avalon Suites. The accommodation is more like a type of airbnb place than a guesthouse as it's self-service - you are emailed door security codes before arrival and don't actually meet anyone though you can email or phone the owner if necessary which worked out fine for me.The room was cosy for 2 people but had space for a sofa and small coffee table. The general decor of the property is nice but there are bits in the room which seem unfinished/DIY eg. bathroom door had an old metal back and can't close properly as it pushes right against the wash basin top, unfinished skirting board, no grouting between tiles etc.Â  The furniture also starting to show signs of wear and tear. The two bedside shelves leaned forward so anything you put on it slid off.No housekeeping in the room during my stay which was not a problem for a few days except that I like the bin to be cleared daily so I ended up taking it to the outside refuse bin myself on the third day.The main negative for me was the bed. It was creaky and the mattress was too big for the bedframe - about half a foot too long and too wide.  So I had to take care not to lean on the edge, which was difficult when you get up in the middle of the night as the space on one side of the bed is tight with wire baskets next to it.  The room has no window, just a bare roof light above the bed - a blind would have helped to block out the morning sunshine.I can only feedback on the room I stayed in, not sure what other rooms are like.  In summary, there are definitely a number of improvements that would make the accommodation a lot better but I don't think I can really complain because it met our basic requirements for a short stay and was value for money given the downtown location and the relatively low price for Toronto.",

Although it is located near where downtown ends, the Sherbourne station is just a few steps and it is also within walking distance of bus stops that provide access to either side of the fantastic city of Toronto. In our case, we didn't need to use the help of the staff because they provided us a contact for any need. Before our arrival, everytime we needed something, we received a satisfactory response. Just days before reaching the hotel, the staff provided us with a path and entrance code to access the hotel. If you plan to visit the city of Toronto and staying at this hotel I encourage you to use Google Maps and explore its surroundings so that you can make the most of the things that are nearby. If you like nature an animals, just a few steps ahead you'll find The Riverdale Farm which is located in Cabbage Town.I hope you enjoy your visit at the Avalon.",

The kitchenette had the basics that we required to make a few simple meals and the apartment's proximity to NoFrills and Shoppers made it easy to quickly get groceries. The bed was very comfortable and the shower was luxurious. The management and housekeeping were very responsive, attentive, helpful and accommodating. Tourist information for Toronto was provided in the lobby and our room. Using codes to access the house and room was easy and it was nice to avoid having keys.

I attempted to do this on a number of occasions and got nothing but an answering machine and never received a call back which is frankly a fairly unacceptable level of service. I was incredibly disappointed that the hotel had listed itself and appears under searches specifically requesting parking as this is frankly not the case at all. The 'parking' that the guest house 'has' is simply a very run down public car park further down the road which was fairly expensively priced and had very little security which meant an anxious stay wondering if our car would still be there in the morning. Frankly I was astounded that the guest house lists itself as having parking at all and believe this should be more adequately described on the expedia page and they should remove themselves from the search criteria for having parking as a facility as this is untrue and would stop anyone else being duped as we were. We were given the Dietrich suite which at first did seem nice and had adequate storage and a kitchenette. However the quality we soon saw to be fairly poor. The ceiling was peeling with falling paint and the shower did not work. We were presented with at first glance a very modern shower with 2 heads and side jets. However the only part that worked was the jets which meant my thighs got a reasonable wash but little else. Overall I would not return.",

About a week prior to our departure, we received an email stating that we should receive an email with our access codes to get in the building and our room. We never received such an e-mail. The day prior our departure, we sent a first email to obtain these codes but did not receive a reply. I send another email while on our way to Toronto and this time we were given the needed codes as there is nobody to receive you. We arrived late at the Guest House, only to discover the room had not been cleaned after the previous guest had left. After sending an email to the contact person, we were told to use a different room located on the 3rd floor but just for the night. The Dean Room (every room is dedicated to a movie star). This room was not bad. Some issue I had with it was that at some places in the room, the ceiling was coming quite low. The TV is located midway above the bed so you basically have to be lying down in the bed to watch tv. There are no curtains for the shower so it is hard not get the floor wet. Coming back from breakfast the day after, we saw the cleaning lady working in our original  room. Not long after, she told us it was time to move back to our other room (Dietrich) as she needed to clean this one (Dean room). Apart from some water damage seen on the ceiling, it looked ok. More scrubbing would not hurt. Getting in the shower the day after was very disappointing. Basically, only the body jets were working with a very faint drip coming down from the wand. Asking to get access to a room with a working shower, we were told that no other rooms were available and that at some point a plumber had somehow fixed the shower so that both the jets and wand were working. They are also expecting a replacement part to fix it at some point but not while we are there. If the room does not have a working shower, why rent it? As for being a full house, as someone else points out in its review, we can hear neighbours and it did not look like there were a lot of people in the building. As far as security, I would not leave any valuables in the room as I don't believe the access codes ever get changed. Some good points are close to little shopping mall with Grocery store. Close to Shoppers Drug Store. There is also a small Breakfast and Lunch place close to it.With all the problems we had, I would be surprise that we go back to this place.",

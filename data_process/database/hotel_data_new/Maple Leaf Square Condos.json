      "text": "Great location near docks and public transportation.  A little difficult to get into from parking facility, but we figured it out.  Efficiency apartment was small but worked well for us.  Having a washer/dryer in the room was very helpful. A few maintenance things were amiss, but not terrible.  Pool and spa was closed for renovation.",

      "text": "Probably the worst stay of my life. The air conditioner did not work. The wife would not reach the bedroom which was tough to do in a condo that’s less than 600 sq ft. The dryer had a broken mob and wouldn’t work. I called customer service and talked to a guy named Lex who said he would help which of course he didn’t. We had to leave the unit with soaking wet clothes in our suitcases. Terrible everything.",

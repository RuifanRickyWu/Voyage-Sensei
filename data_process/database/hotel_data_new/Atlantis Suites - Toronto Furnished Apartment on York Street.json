We made the mistake of giving our credit card information when we checked in. The owner charged our credit card $70 after we returned. I emailed her and asked the reason of this charge. No response! I called her and she said she would call me back. No calls! So, I reported it as fraud and cancelled my card. It was very unprofessional. She thinks that she can charge your card without any explanation.",

      "text": "I selected this property because it is close to Union Station, and we were arriving after dark.  I had booked months in advance and was a bit mystified by the directions to enter the rear courtyard. Arriving at 14 York St, someone was going into the building and we followed. The security man was really unpleasant and gave the impression we were doing something underhand.  Very quickly, the young man from the apartments arrived to take us to apt 5806 and show us around. The apt had everything, and it was all in perfect condition. Kitchen, bathroom, sitting room and bedroom, Fantastic view from bedroom and sitting room. Plenty of cleaning materials, cutlery, crockery, etc. King bed with heaps of pillows. When I booked I thought it a bit expensive, but, considering the quality of the appointments, it is quite reasonable aa long as you don't want to have the rooms cleaned and made up each day.  No-one bothered us or checked on us for the four days we were there.  Would stay there again gladly (we used the courtyard entrance while we were there to avoid the nasty security man).There are 67 levels in the condo, but we didn't try to get to the roof because the views from level 58 were great.",

      "text": "We were a group of 4 women on a Mother's Day trip to Toronto. I found this listing on expedia, but booked directly with Tina, who was very helpful and easy to get in touch with. The value for 4 of us was incredible! It was $325/night ($25/night for guest 3 and 4) and $100 for a cleaning fee. It was so nice to have the 2 bedrooms and bathrooms, kitchen and seating area. 4 of us in a regular hotel room would have been more expensive as well as cramped. The unit was very clean, the kitchen is equipped with Tassimo and kettle (coffee and tea included) as well as a few pots and pans which weren't used, as well as cups, plates, etc. There were only 4 towels in the unit, so we did wash a load for fresh towels. Washer and dryer and detergent included in unit. The queen beds were very comfortable. You will have some street noise, but it's more of a white noise until a loud vehicle goes by. Or the construction next door decides to jackhammer concrete at 8:00 am on Saturday. Having said that, the location can't be beat! Right across the street from Maple Leaf Square, which has an LCBO and Longo's supermarket. A block away from the ACC and 2 away from Rogers Centre and Ripley's aquarium. We will definitely book again when visiting Toronto!",

On arrival at (strictly 3.00pm) cleaners were still there and sheets and towels still in drier which we had to finished by us.Kitchen lacked basic tools for cooking and had to request further. Only 2 cups for 4 people. Comms was difficult but got done through our original booking contact.Shower was weak and luke warm, bath wouldn't empty and had to pull a lot of hair out of plug hole. No instructions given on rubbish disposal or recycling.  Very little room in main bedroom due to size for suitcases.Pre arrival a lot of paper work and talk about secuirty etc, however when there main doors were easily accessed by guests shadowing in, but no issues with security.Good washing machine and drier and soap powder was left behind. Dont look for Atlantis anywhere either when trying to locate, called something else. Good for 2 people, and had nice view of harbour.  Handy to shops and small supermaket and train station.",

      "text": "We stayed in 2502, which was fairly comfortable.Â Pros: Great location, across the street from a grocery store, nice views. Tina was very responsive to emails. The furniture was in good condition. Â Cons: 1) When we first arrived we called Maria who was responsible for checking us in, to ask about the entrance for parking but she had no idea what the name of the street was and just said that we should go in through the back of the building. This was very confusing, so it took us over an hour to drive around the area and eventually find parking. I suggest making sure the people responsible for receiving guests know the names of the streets around the building and are better prepared to provide directions, esp. considering some people are visiting Toronto for the first time and have been traveling for a long time.Â 2) There was mold in the shower curtain.Â 3) Warm tap water from the bathroom came out white, not clear.Â 4) The walls in the closets needs to be repainted.",

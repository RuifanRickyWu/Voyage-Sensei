From the amazing breakfast to the handmade lotions it was a delight. Once again it did not disappoint. The proximity to the Distillery district, the free parking, and the freedom to come and go made it the perfect set up for us. Include a meal at Ruby Watchco and a coffee at Cluny and you will have a perfect downtown weekend!",

      "text": "Our family of 4 (2 teen kids) stayed for 4 nights. The hosts are amazing and made us feel at home immediately, introducing us to their home where we had the place to ourselves. We were on the last leg of a 10 week trip all over Europe and where we rented houses and were cooking for ourselves. We were at The Percy because of the location (walking distance to downtown) and we like to have a kitchen. So when we arrived we told them they didn't need to make us breakfast since just do something simple. They insisted, and are we ever glad they did! Each day they asked us what time we would like breakfast and they showed up at that time to cook for us. Everyday we had a breakfast that topped the previous. They use the best, local, fresh, organic ingredients and cook and bake from scratch. David is an excellent cook. I left inspired to try to elevate my morning routine at home to remind me of my stay at The Percy. It was nice to have their expert advice each morning on that day's activities. We talked about where we might go and they always had ideas of what else we could do nearby or what we should make sure to see. When I think back on the previous 10 weeks in Europe I wish I had someone local like them, and if I had, how much frustration could have been avoided. The neighborhood is full of trendy cafes, restaurants, and bars, parks and public transportation is good, We took public transport all over Europe and were happy to not have a car in Toronto. One block from tram. If I was going to live in Toronto, this is the area I would want to live in, and I would want to have Kali and David as friends. They are wonderful people and made our stay.",

Beautifully appointed, totally comfortable, bright and cheerful with understated luxury.  The best part was the thoughtful and respectful attentions from my hosts Kali and David.

You con easily join the centre of the city with public transports. The owners are two fantastic hosts. We spent a week with them and for me it was like to be in a family. Our vacation was fun also because we could practice our english with them. The service was better than a 4 stars hotel. At Percy you can use whatever you need: washer, dryer, kitchen..... They had many attentions for our allergy problems. They prepared some amazing gluten free muffins for my celiac daughter. And she is still remembering them. In case we needed they also provided every kind of things and informations. Nothing more to say, just try to believe.",

The whole spotless townhouse is cleverly designed to make the most of every inch of space, and feels at once cozy and modern. The beds are super comfy to ensure a good night's sleep before a great homemade breakfast. Location-wise, everything is close at hand, including access to streetcars to explore the city, but the B&B is enough off the beaten path to feel really relaxing. Can't wait to return!",

It's short cab or streetcar ride downtown, or a quick walk if you feel like seeing a bit of the city during your stay. Kali and David were the perfect hosts. Attentive without being overbearing, they gladly accommodated my early mornings, and left a fridge well-stocked with breakfast necessities. I had the calm and privacy of a conventional hotel without the depressing anonymity. The space is warm and exceptionally well decorated. I was also very well directed to local restaurants which, being slightly outside the downtown core, I wouldn't have discovered on my own. Overall it's a terrific stop for the business traveller looking for sophistication, character, and calm. A terrific find!",

The Percy is situated on a very quaint and quiet street in a safe area of Toronto.  The King Streetcar is less than a minute away and takes you downtown in less than 10 minutes. The hosts provided great restaurant recommendations in the area. Fusilli restaurant on Queen Street (a couple of blocks away) had one of the best past dishes I have experienced in a long time.  The space is also a 10 minute walk from the Distillery District where you can find many unique shops and galleries.  The St. Laurence Market is also only a few minutes away where you can shop for Fresh produce and meats, or stroll through their Sunday Antique Market.  I highly recommend the Percy.

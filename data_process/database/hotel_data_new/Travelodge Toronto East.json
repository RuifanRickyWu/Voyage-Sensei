      "text": "I was \"bumped\" to this hotel because the facility in which our group was originally booked was full.  The staff at check in was very friendly and professional, and the lobby presents a decent first impression, but that's about all this place has going for it.The Travelodge is a depressing remnant of late '70's early '80's architecture with furnishings and decor to match. Expect worn carpets, threadbare upholstery and linens, dingy bathrooms that are unable to be properly cleaned any longer, and lumpy, uncomfortable beds.The night we were there the hotel was home to two peewee hockey groups.  These children were left unsupervised until at least 11PM, during which time they ran wild through the hallways while their parents partied downstairs at the 'dungeon' known as \"Shoeless Joe's\".  Two calls to the front desk did little to stop these poorly raised hellions from preventing everyone else on our floor from getting any sleep.  The continental 'breakfast' the next morning is bleak.  You are better off to skip it entirely and head to the Golden Griddle next door or Starbucks down the street.  The rate we were charged was $89 per night, which seems like a total ripoff when you can get 4-star hotels in dowtown Toronto on Priceline for $50.   If you are looking for a decent hotel in this area consider the Holiday Inn Express instead- newer, with nicer rooms and ammenities.",

After arguing for 15 minutes she finally calls the manager (Sugan) who Refuses my government ID as well. He would not speak to me, at that Point another agent walked in and educated the girl at the desk about the government ID.and told me they do accept this GOVERMENT I.d. Great I finally checked in. I enter the elevator it smells like Pee,entered the room the room had a mold smell to it looked very old the AC was taped to the wall the bed had no sheet only had a bed skirt,the brown blanket had holes in it,the shower was missing a shower head, the towels were old and had holes In it,the walls were empty and thin. At checkout the manger on duty (sugan) went to go check my room for cash deposit. And he accuses me of smoking in the room. As a non smoker I got so upset and had asked him to take me to the room and prove me I smoked. I went back in the room it didn't smell like smoke, it had no butts and it had no ashes..he refused to listen instead he was very rude, asked to speak to the general manager they gave me his card and said call him later he's not available. Being accused and than being charged for the accusation is unacceptable... Never stay at this hotel. The environment of this hotel is absolutely disgusting.

      "title": "Bad Hotel Experience Overall - Did Not Stay the Night",
      "text": "I was looking around for a hotel I could use for attending a company Christmas party. This particular hotel was the closest and cheapest. I was soon to find out why it was so cheap.In reading the online reviews I simply thought that this hotel had gotten a bit of a bad rep for whatever reasons and booked away. At $80 per night, how could one go wrong? Well, I did, and it went very wrong. It had such potential to be a great place for a gettaway though. They have a Shoeless Joes built into the hotel and plenty of nearby ammeneties. There is no longer a Golden Griddle nearby however.Problems started at check in when my access card for my room refused to work. I had to go up and down at least 3 times before my room door opened and by this time I had to have a manager accompany me to check that out.When I opened the door to my room, despite having a \"non-smoking room\", the whole room smelled of heavy cigarette smoke and was damp and a bit cold. I noticed a heat-pump unit on the wall but no thermostat/controls for it and there was a bag completely covering it.Additionally, the ironing board was nowhere to be found, and I had to call the front desk to get one. They did bring that however so I really can't complain about that. However, of all the things to not have in a hotel room, an ironing board seems pretty odd to not have.I utilized their pool, which, for all extensive purposes was nice minus the fact there was no changing room so I had to change on the deck. After utilizing the pool I went back to my hotel room to find my cards not working again. After 3 trips the woman at the desk I had spoken to about the keys asked me if I was checking out (even though I had been to the hotel for less than 2 hours).After returning to the hotel, my cards, once again, did not work and I had to ask the duty manager to get my room open because I was leaving. I was not going to chance this room more than I had and I was not willing to give their breakfast a shot. Nothing personal about him, just frusterated by the fact that I wasted my money on a bad room. I was tempted to ask for my money back but by this time, I just wanted to get out of there and find a better place to crash at.Take my advice: spend a few extra bucks on a room at the Holiday Inn Express on 50 Estate Drive (it's a stone's throw away and a hell of a lot cleaner/nicer).",

First of all, I have stayed in many hotels all over North America and this was the first time I was ever asked to take my drivers liscense out and give them! I asked the gentleman at the front desk why he needed my license, he said to fill out the information on it. That was fine when he passed it back, the lady at the front desk passed me a piece of paper to fill out all my information!?! I thought it different but I got over that. I then asked for a king size bed but there was none left, so I asked for something bigger than two double beds, I'm fairly tall so a double just won't cut it, and it was only my wife and our 9 year old son, so a king bed would do fine. tThey finally put us in a room with two queen size beds, perfect, I thought. Opened the door to the room, oh my god, I did really want to take off my boots! The carpet was old, very stained and ragged, the wall paper, or whatever was on the walls, was stained all over and falling off, there was three BIG dents in the wall, just at a glance! The boxsprings on the bed were showing and STAINED!! Then there's the bath room, all I could think was 'That Seventies Show', in serious need of an upgrade! We convinced ourselves that it was only one night and settled in only to be awakined at 2am by the sound of the neighbours headboard hitting off the wall repeatedly. (what could they be doing?) I almost forgot to mention the lampshades, filthy, stained and ragged. Needless to say, I will not be staying at this hotel anymore and I would not recommend this hotel to anyone!!",

I pointed out to them that they had contracted to me for a room with a tv but that went right over their heads.  I asked how they could know that the tv could not be easily fixed when they had not even taken he time to come to my room to see it and when I asked for a refund they said they would come down.  He did, and finally after an hour and a half waiting they got it fixed.  I pointed out that the internet was not working and he said \"Oh wait til later as we don't have enough band width\" never conceding that they had contracted to provide band width.  And it was a poor signal and not bandwidth anyhow.    Breakfast was supposed to end that day at 10 and I got there and the bacon or sausage or what ever it was, was all gone and I got only a tiny bit of the eggs even though I was there at 15 minutes to.  Many people came in after me still well before 10 and they got none at all of those items.  Room was also too hot as heat was stuck on. Room in drastic need of decorating.  I would NEVER recommend this place to anyone. If you say you provide breakfast until 10 then  do it.  If you say you provide tv and internet then do it and don't make stupid excuses.  The night before I stayed in an old fashioned '50's hotel for $70 and had a fantastic night.  The night in this place was terrible!",

The staff was very friendly and always helpful. The complimentary breakfast was convenient, but very plain.Some of the highlights were the attached restaurant/sports bar Shoeless Joe's, which was close and offered good grub. We also enjoyed the pool, which was clean and had a comfortable temperature.A few improvements I could suggest would be the addition of a small changing area at the pool. Also, we could not use the coffee maker in our room without unplugging the TV or moving it.It is an okay stay if travelling on a budget and if you have activities planned in the Scarborough area.",

Breakfast included bagels, muffins, sliced bread, jam, cream cheese, scrambled eggs, sausage, waffles, cereal, fruit, juices, coffee, tea and hot chocolate. On site restaurant is called Shoeless Joe's. It is a sports bar and restaurant with very good food. Hotel gave us a 15% discount coupon good for one meal.

We never had a bad experience up until this past weekend Feb. 23, 2013.  After revealing our hotel right away I came on this sight to read reviews and to my knowledge, it was all negative!  I was so disappointed but I couldn't get a refund so we decided to roll with it and maybe it wouldn't be so bad.  So 1st of all i can't believe this is a hotel, this should not be on any website as a hotel but a motel.  The front check in looks upgraded which is misleading because when you get to the rooms, the carpets are indeed stained, the bed is busted, the air circulation in the room makes your nose and throat dry all night.  This wasn't even the smoking room! The shower head in the washroom was busted, there was limited towels and the free breakfast was nasty!  For a couple of dollars more, you can get a better hotel.  There's a saying you pay for what you get and in this case you don't even get that.  If this hotel wants to make it they need some serious upgrades and should listen to what people are writing on this website.  Instead of having the front with a flat screen tv and looking nice, use some of that money and upgrade your rooms and maybe you'll see better results and ratings!",

We had our 13-year-old son with us and wanted a relaxing weekend away.  The zoo was magnificient but the hotel's pool and hot tub were disappointments and detracted from our weekend.  The pool is in an air-conditioned room and was only room temperature because of a broken heater.  When we spoke to management about this, they said that the pool maintenance company had been called but had not responded (it was the beginning of a long holiday weekend).  They told us that nothing could be done about the temperature of the pool.  We thought that the hot tub would be okay but the water was a murky shade of green, dead bugs were floating on the top, and when we turned on the jets, large amounts of dirty, shampoo-like bubbles rapidly formed on the surface.  We spoke to management about this late Friday afternoon and were told that the tub would be drained, cleaned, re-filled and ready to use by the time we returned from the zoo on Saturday evening.  We took one glance at it on Saturday evening and noticed that the hot tub was dirtier and foamier than ever.  Clearly, the management had not followed through on their promise.  If we had only been travelling for business and wanted a quiet, clean room at a cheap price, this hotel would have been okay.  We didn't use the free continental breakfast but instead ate breakfast at The Golden Griddle, using the hotel's 15% discount coupon.

It offers the cheapest rates, free parking, free high speed internet, local calls, breakfest. We deiceded to stay in the Sleepy Bears Den (A room made for kids). It includes a VCR, Kids Designs, and a table and chair for the Kids.We are only paying $89.00. Which is a bargin compared to other hotels in the area. The breakfest is quite good which muffins, bagles, fruit, juice. The room is very clean and in good working order (Since is a Kid Room). The room is extremly Clean, and all the extra benefits are great (Pool, Fitness Cnter, Shoeless Joes.) It is also close to the 401, ZOO, Downtown. If your looking for a great place to stay at a great price and want to be near everything this place is for you.",

Although we were told check in was at three o'clock,we were not in our rooms until 4:10.Having a 5 month old baby and a \"special needs\" child in our group this made for a real inconvience. We arrived at the motel at around 1:30, so the front desk knew of our arrival. We were repeatedly told that the rooms weren\"t cleaned yet. I'm not sure they were cleaned at all since we found pretzels under the bed. The pool was overcrowded all weekend, mostly with unsupervised children. Although our day at the zoo was great, the Travelodge was not.",

Spent 1/2 hr on the phone with Front Desk person trying to find the reservation .. to be told there wasn't a reservation for me. One month later I get my Cc'd bill and they charge me as a NO SHOW!! Called hotel to dispute but was told they could do nothing .. all of their staff are long term and know how the system works. Taking it up with my cc'd company. How to hell are you suppose to cancel a reservation when they are telling you you don't have one. Total lack of customer service ... watch your charges if your staying at this hotel and if they tell you that you don't have a reservation with them email them over and over!!!!!",

We were told this was a pre-authorization to my credit card that would be reversed in three or four days.  We have stayed at many Travelodge's and not one has done this. When we checked out the front desk staff still wanted to put this on my bill. Only when I refused did they put my credit card through for the room only.There were two of us and there was only one wash cloth and hand towel in the room.When I asked for another set of towels and was cloths they brought POOL TOWELS for us. As for the indoor pool no one used it the whole weekend it smelled so strong of pool chemicals.We would not recommend this hotel to anyone.",

The fee is significantly higher than the charges from 4-star hotel... My older furbaby whined through out the night, refused to eat his food or sausage, did not pee or poop... Very unusual of him... My husband and i woke up at 630am the next day... Very unusual also for both of us on a weekend and when we are on a mini-holiday... We cancelled our plans that and decided to return home as soon as we were up as we couldnt bear to stay at the hotel anymore.. We didnt even shower as we wanted to just hurry and leave the hotel!!!  Thats how uncomfortable we were....The bat tub was not clean; the air con did not cool down the room although it was set on \"high\"... The aircon was noisy also... I would never ever stay at any travelodge anymore... It is worth spending more money on more decent hotels than stay at travelodge...",

The General Manager asked me to pay again if I wanted to check in, inspite of showing him my confirmation. He said that he doesnt deal with \"these websites\" so it is my problem and I needed to get my money back from Trip Advisor.After a lot of argument and back and forth for more than 30 minutes, I finally got a room.. Went upto the room and the room was a dirty room (Housekeeping didnot clean it after the last guest checked out). I had to come down again and ask for another room.. and the gentleman at the reception treated me as if it is my fault.. Instead of apologizing, he questioned me 4 times, if I was sure... so I decided to bring their Housekeeping Manager with me to show him..The new room was terrible, dirty, smells like fungus.",

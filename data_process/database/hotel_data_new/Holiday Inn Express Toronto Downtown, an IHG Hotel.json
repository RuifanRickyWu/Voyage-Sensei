There were three of us in the room and we did not feel cramped at all. We were on the 8th floor facing the courtyard where vehicles drop guests off and found it to be quiet. All of the staff were very friendly. The complimentary breakfast was a mixture of hot and cold foods, offering something for everyone. It can get very busy there in the mornings but there is a lot of seating in the breakfast area.  As well, the staff were consistently topping the food up so that things did not run out.  We found the free WIFI to work well. We plan to stay here again the next time we visit Toronto.",

The initial check-in was a little different but this was the first time I was staying at a hotel since the pandemic started.  It was all contactless and while they normally offer a breakfast bar during the stay they had prepackaged foods like granola bars, yogurt cups, etc. for breakfast due to the restrictions.The room I stayed in was on the 16th floor and had a partial view of the CN Tower which was nice.  It was a quiet room and quite clean overall.  The bathroom was very bright and had a nice shower in it.  There was a microwave and mini fridge and safe in the room with a small workspace and TV.  I was able to connect to their internet with no trouble. (I used wifi but it looked like there was a spot for a wired connection)  The one thing I didn't like was the lamp on the worktable I had in the room was an odd touch lamp, I prefer ones with a switch.  Otherwise though the stay was nice and I had everything I needed.The staff were friendly and there is underground parking available (I already had parking nearby from my previous accommodation).  The main lobby area is secured by keycard or buzzer through the main entrance.  Overall, if I needed to stay for a couple nights in the same area I would have no problem going back to this location.",

The room is clean and comfy with all expected comforts.   I appreciate the less waste in the room toiletries with wall mounted bottles of lovely JR Watkins shampoo, conditioner and shower gel. Breakfast was typical hotel breakfast - but everything was bright, clean, well stocked and hot/fresh.  Overall,  our stay was perfect for our Toronto getaway during Christmas market season.

The hotel does not do any room service during your stay unless requested 24 hours in advance.We had breakfast included with the package we took. The breakfast items were mostly the same every day : eggs, sausages, make your own pancakes, fruits (orange/banana), cereals, yogurts, small muffins, orange/apple juice, etc...The front desk members and other staff were always friendly, helpful and courteous. The room was overall very good as well as the breakfast. The location is great as everything is at a small walking distance. There is a park next to the hotel too.Overall, everything was excellent.

Only 2 elevators which proved to be challenging during busier times. The breakfast space was too small for a hotel of this size. The lineup for eggs and bacon was not worth it.

Finally at 2 am I called desk they said they will definitely look into it and find room. But unfortunately it didnâ€™t stop.

      "text": "Travelling with family (Aug 22 thru 29) to explore Toronto major downtown attractions: Union station (travelling to/from airport by Union Express), CN Tower, Ripley's Aquarium, Toronto Eaton Centre, Yonge-Dunda Square, Entertainment district (Soho), St. Lawrence Market, Distillery District,  Royal Ontario Museum, Eataly (famous Italian dining and supermarket), Casa Loma, University of Toronto (constantly ranked #1 or #2 in Canada), Spadina, University Blvd, Jack Layton Ferry Terminal for heading to Centre Island, Harbourfront Centre, etc.Most of attractions above are within few blocks walking distance. You could explore thru massive underground mall (PATH) to and from the hotel, and/or with Ride Hailing (Lyft or Uber) would average range between $8 to $15. This is a great value hotel, clean, spacious, free hot breakfast (love that cute automated pancakes maker -> push 1 button for 2 pancakes). Both front desk staff and breakfast area are cordial and attentive. The WIFI at night could sometime be slower at night, understandably with increase usage when the hotel guests are mostly back in their room, but reasonably fast in the morning. Likewise for the shower water pressure. These 2 areas perhaps could be improved.Would love to come back again in the future.",

The rooms are excellent and have heating/AC as required. Got a room with a view on the top floor which was spectacular.Room comes with fridge and microwave which is a nice bonus. There is a local store, plenty of restaurants and the St Lawrence Market to help feed yourself.Breakfast was good with plenty of options and enough â€˜portableâ€™ items to helps with daytime snacking.The location allows for easy/moderate walks to all of the downtown areas including Harbour front, Distillery, Corktown, CN Tower, Kensington, Chinatown.",

      "text": "I really enjoyed my stay at this hotel for a 4 night work trip and would definitely stay again next time I'm in Toronto. The staff were all great and v accommodating to my requests. My room was spacious (by European standards) and the bathroom and shower were good, decent toiletries and no problem with hot water. It's only a 15min walk from Union station, and I really liked the location just on the edge of the main downtown area so that there are some smaller more 'local' feeling restaurants around (Cafe Oro di Napoli just across the road was great for pizza), but you are still close to everything downtown. St Lawrence market is v close by too. Great tram and subway connections. My room had a nice view on onto the St James's park and church in front. Lifts were quick and efficient getting up and down. Breakfast was fine, although 'scrambled' egg appeared to be chopped up cubes of hard omlette which was odd, and it was a real pity that we had to eat on paper plates and with disposable cutlery. As a tea drinker I would have liked a kettle in my room as the hot water that came out of the coffee machine in the room wasn't hot enough to make decent tea, however, there was v hot water (and more coffee) available in reception 24/7 if you needed it. In spite of these small issues I would definitely stay here again.",

      "text": "We arrived as part of a USA & Canada trip from Ireland. My second visit to Canada and my partners first visit. This hotel was fantastic. We had started our trip in San Francisco in a holiday inn express so we hoped this hotel would mirror the experience we had there and it did! We were greeted as we entered by a gentleman on the desk. This was Easter time and the hotel had chocolate treats at the desk for guests. Thoughtful little gesture.  The guy was very friendly and welcoming. He made sure that we would have a nice room and also that we would have a room up high to enjoy a nice view.  Breakfast was included and we were again very impressed with the service and the selection that was on offer for breakfast just like San Francisco hotel. We arrived in our room which was great. The room had all the essentials and was very clean and Modern.  The view was amazing overlooking the park across from the hotel and a view of all the sky scrapers in downtown Toronto.  The hotel was very close to a metro supermarket for food and snacks for the room.   We checked out a lovely restaurant called HOTHOUSE which we enjoyed the food and the service. Please check out a few coffee shops nearby including the black canary, Fahrenheit, b espresso bar and third wave coffee. Just a few mentioned. The hotel is near St Lawrence market for all the foodies.  This market has so much to offer. Lots of local produce and fresh food market stalls for everyone. What a great city and what a fantastic hotel.",

      "title": "Good hotel but with important caveats",
      "text": "Its a nice hotel and makes a good value. The breakfast is great. The rooms are small, but are clean and reasonably modern. Location is good (in terms of distance), on the edge of downtown and is an easy walk or trolley ride to anything you want to see downtown. There is a wonderful park with a kids playground half a block away. However, that \"on the edge\" part is where it gets interesting. A block north or northwest, things quickly look like a different zip code and not a better one. There is a homeless shelter directly across the street, with everything that entails. You constantly see half naked mentally ill or drugged out people sitting near the hotel entrance or walking down the street yelling at no one in particular. Often walking through the wonderful little park.  One evening there was a bag of syringes with other injection accessories spilled all over the ground around the corner. There is clean looking marijuana store next door.  There is another not so clean looking marijuana store a block away. Across the street of that store, there is another homeless shelter or low income housing unit with half a dozen individuals hanging out doing drugs right out on the sidewalk. Its a tough break for this hotel, as it is quite nice, but these are all very important consideration to keep in mind when booking. This is not a family friendly location.",

They new loyal elderly IHG member where coming. At midnight we called to complain about the loud hallway yelling and slamming of doors. At 1:45 AM we had enough and wanted our money back. Front desk said; Was a large group of university students just blowing off steam and having fun. OK. even a new manager would put them on 2 or 3 floors all to themselves. you have 16 floors. We only live 2 hours from the hotel and come into Toronto for Mirvish shows. So we drove home at 2 AM. Dead tired and jet lag as I am writing this.",

Totally not the experience i've had in other buildings downtown. They don't just do their duty, they actively help you out, which kind of feels like I am in a hotel. I like that the concierge helps the delivery guys out instead of delaying our food. :PThey sometimes have a cleaning service too, or provide a vacuum if needed.  :)The rooms are really spacious and very well furnished, the bed is super comfy. My friends who've visited have commented often that the rooms are bigger in general and the whole place has a nice open feel. I absolutely love my study desk. It's massive compared to the places i've stayed or seen in downtown. The bathroom has sufficient linens & toiletries, the only the thing I purchased was a bath bomb for the tub!The location is super convenient, with all major stuff in walking distance. Anything between 0-20 mins is gonna take you from grocery to Eaton on foot. Plenty of good restaurants, LCBO right around. The building also gives discount coupons for restaurants.",

The business manager, Brian,  and guest services staff are extremely pleasant and accommodating as are all the concierge and cleaning and maintenance staff. I recently had a problem with a small maintenance issue in the evening, and the concierge on duty and the maintenance supervisor, Andrew, had the issue resolved immediately. The apt is  large and comfortable, very clean and very well equipped, including a washer and dryer , and there are many amenities including a rooftop lounge and barbecue area overlooking the city and the lake. If you enjoy Sports, the Skydome is at one end of the street, and both The Princess of Wales theatre, the Royal Alex , the Tiff Lightbox and the Scotiabank Cineplex theatre are at the other. Lots of excellent restaurants. Despite all the attractions, the building is very well built and almost totally soundproof. The King St streetcar and the St Andrew subway stop also provide easy inexpensive access to anywhere in the GTA.  I would highly recommend this property to anyone who needs a comfortable apt to either visit or work in Toronto.",

This feedback is a small gesture to express my gratitude towards all that Aliesha, Agape, Lisa, Brian, Amir, Nilesh, Nora, Fady, Jean, Andrew, Anushka have done towards making my stay here so comfortable that I couldn't have asked for a better place than Rosemont. Not to forget, Nora and the housekeeping team do a fabulous job every 2 weeks in my apartment. I don't have to worry about anything as long as you guys are here looking after.In the peak of summers, I was provided with a fan to manage the heat. I dont think even a full service hotel could have provided the kind of service and help i got from the team here. Kudos to everyone for being so empathetic and helping really when it was needed.Today was another housekeeping cycle and I have to say that my apartment is shining and looks fantastic and splendid especially after returning from a long busy day at work. I am running short on words to express that yet again Lisa and Nora did a fabulous fantastic work in cleaning and maintaining my apartment. So so grateful and thankful from the bottom of my heart to everyone. My sincerest gratitude for everyone. I have advised 2 of my friends that if they ever want to change their accommodation, they should consider Rosemont. Its the safest building with the best facilities any resident could have experienced in town.Thank you Team Rosemont, keep up the awesome work you do, you guys are the best and you guys rock it as always. The fact that Residents are so happy here including myself speaks crazy volumes about your team work. Onwards and upwards always.",

Brian Pereira - the man in charge - is super nice and accommodating. He ensured that we continued to stay in the same apartment. Our 2 bedroom apartment was nicely furnished, very clean and had all the basic amenities for a long and comfortable stay. The concierge staff - Jean, Fady, Perry, Andrew and Raj are most warm, welcoming, helpful and knowledgable. They always greet you with a cheerful smile. Even the building maintenance team of Brian and Andrew (yes, there are 2 Brians and 2 Andrews in this building) are very cooperative and helpful. The building is very well lit, super safe and has some great music playing in the lobby. 04 fast elevators mean you do not waste time waiting for your elevator and they also have a special service elevator for heavy stuff like your furniture etc. The location of the building is also very central. You are surrounded by eating places, the theatre district, cinema halls, shopping, Rogers Centre, CN Tower, Ripleys Aquarium etc. and there is even a coffee shop, massage parlour and a dentist in the building annexe. Overall, it was a truly delightful stay at the Rosemont Residences and we shall make this our home away from home, whenever we visit Toronto. My sincere thanks to Brian x 2, Nilesh, Agape, Aamir, Andrew x 2, Jean, Fady, Perry, Raj and all the others for making our stay in Toronto a truly happy and memorable one !!",

      "text": "I moved into a furnished 1-bedroom unit in Rosemont Residences back in Feb 2019. What initially started as a temporary visit unexpectedly turned into a 2.5-year stay (partly thanks to, of course, what happened in 2020), and I could not be happier with my choice to call Rosemont Residences home.Personally, what was most important to me was that Rosemont Residences offered the flexibility and service usually provided by a hotel (when it comes to booking, extending stay or housekeeping), along with the comfort typically associated with an apartment complex (e.g., amenity, in-unit kitchen/washer/dryer). Due to my special circumstances, I had to renew my stay on a month-to-month basis. Gladly, with the help of Aliesha, Patricia and Nilesh, it was never a problem.Location was also a big plus. It was ~10-min walk away from Bay St, TN Tower or subway. There were plenty of restaurants and grocery stores to choose from. Some of the Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF) 2019 events took place right outside the building. It was located, quite literally, at the heart of downtown Toronto.The staff were all nice and friendly. Maintenance requests were usually completed within a day. Incoming packages were properly taken care of by the concierge. I would like to give a special shoutout to Mr. Miles, whose enthusiasm at greeting everyone at the lobby always made my day.In short, I recommend Rosemont Residences to both casual visitors and those who are looking for a long stay in downtown Toronto. It has a lot of nice things to offer: flexibility, comfortableness, location and a helpful staff.",

Once the balcony door is closed, it is almost sound-proof!  Big plus for me as I was in T.O. on business as well as play/fun.  The R.R. is near the lake which was great.

As I had to quarantine for 14 days, I couldn't have done without their help as they ensured that all the possible services were offered at my doorstep. Advantages of staying at Rosemont include: 1) Great in-house maintenance 2) Friendly concierge and building management 3) Free visitor's parking 4) Rooms are decent sized (as per DowntownToronto standards) and well-equipped 4) Centrally located (close to major tourist sites, cafes, and restaurants, walking distance to  Union Station/St. Andrew and all bank HQs) 6) No waiting time for lifts 7) Flexible payment terms Given it's a pet-friendly building, I think common area cleaning can be improved slightly. I haven't used the heating at all (at least to date), which does save electricity, but the bedroom can get warm at times.Can't comment on amenities as I haven't been able to use them due to Covid restrictions but looking forward to using them in the future.Overall it has been a great experience to date and am hoping to keep staying here until work makes me relocate.

I needed a substitute premise pronto as I had non refundable plane arrangements and business meetings scheduled.I am so pleased to have found Rosemount. It is in a good location in the entertainment district near the CN tower and many cafes and with easy access to the waterfront and public transit. The staff are friendly, helpful and respectful. Jean is especially attentive as a concierge opening doors even when busy and assuring excellent music as one enters or exits. Each other concierge is helpful so someone trains and supervisesnwell.Everything advertises lives up to what is stated from the exercise room to the business Centre to the large meeting room with sofas and fireplace. The rooftop common area is large and has three or four areas so that individuals can find quiet spots and small groups can socialize.We did have difficulty with the TV remotes and would have appreciated cleaner windows and removal of blue paint on the balcony floor and red smear on a balcony window given we were in a premium suite newly renovated at a considerable cost. Premises were clean and housekeeping responded to our requests for natural cleaning products. All requests were met in a timely fashion. There was much nearby street construction because of pandemic delays to needed infrastructure work. Also thereIs a laneway where trucks back up and are noisy. Shutting windows and patio door does assist but the no fresh air. All in all the pros far outweigh the cons  it is a better value than the nearby Marriott or even Ritz Carleton,",

You'll end up paying for an overpriced room with deteriorating appliances and dirty dishes. Enjoy !",

The rooms are nice but the noise in the hallway from other guests was over-whelming...especially after midnight! I made a comment to the staff an they said 'that there was nothing we could do'! I selected the Rosemont because of their fitness facility...again, another major disappointment! The equipment needs replacing and supervision. Most of the cardio equipment needs maintenance or is out of order...I made a comment to the staff an they said 'that there was nothing we could do'! I had a relative visiting me and the front line staff did not know how to obtain a visitor parking permit and how to buzz people in from my room.There is no information in the room about the facilities and services available i.e. room service, location of gym, internet access, parking, etc... I made a comment to the staff an they said 'that nobody else has made a comment'. This poor customer service has unfortunately left me no choice but to find alternate arrangements for my colleagues and I for future visits.",

The apartment received lots of natural light, was very clean, excellent bedding, the kitchen was equipped with all basic cooking appliances.The Rosemont is located in the Financial/Theatre District, near buses and subways just round the corner, just 2 blocks away from the famous CN Tower. We loved the place, but didnÂ´t like the fact that when we needed talk to someone from the administration we just had to leave a message on their answering machine, and nobody got the call back, makes you feel so lonely!!! Besides, they gave us only 2 card keys, it was complicated considering we were 5 people, when we asked for at least another key they refused to give it to us. Anyway, it was a small matter, the place is ok, a good deal, considering we payed just usd 43 pp/day. I`d stay there again.",

      "title": "Not bad but too many false fire alarms from tenants cooking improperly!",
      "text": "I stayed here in 2007 back in the furnished suites and it was very nice. I am back here temporairily in an unfurnished suite. The building is tired and worn looking now however they are renovating but it will not be done until mid 2017. The appliances are still older white ones and not stainless but I hear they will be upgrading those too and there is older carpet in the bedrooms and laminate throughout. The kitchen has nice granite type tiles.. I think with this building you pay mainly for the location as it is almost $2000 for 650 sq feet but it is right downtown Toronto and that includes utilities and amenities such as a fairly good gym and rooftop patio. No pool or whirlpool. It is a pet friendly and lots of dogs here so that is one reason I returned as I have two little dogs.One main issue is the fire alarm keeps going off constantly. This was an issue last time too in 2007. I heard it is from people cooking in their suites and opening their apartment door to filter the smoke out which sets the alarm off. It happens alot.Another issue is, I find there are alot of younger people (teens and twenty year olds in here) now. Not sure if their parents co sign and pay as I cannot understand how they afford it but I have had to call security a few times as of constant running down the hallways on weekend nights and loud parties. Last weekend the police had to come to stop the party at midnight and get all the people out of the condo two doors down.My advice is, if you want this location, then check this place out, if you can put aside the fire alarms, potential for parties and a younger crowd, and like a pet friendly building and do not care about construction or an older suite with appliances. I am here only for a year as I plan to buy a place nearby so needed something quick and just for short term but living here long term for me, would not be ammenable. I have been here since Oct 2016. The staff is great though and very accomadating which is a plus.",

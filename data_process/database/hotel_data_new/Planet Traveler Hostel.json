      "text": "During my recent stay at Planet Traveler Hostel, I discovered a welcoming haven with a few noteworthy aspects to share with fellow travelers. Overall, my experience was delightful, although there are some considerations to keep in mind.The hostel's interior is impeccably maintained, offering a comfortable and inviting ambiance. It's important to be aware, however, that rooms on the top floor require ascending three flights of stairs. While this may pose a challenge for some, the tranquility of the top floor compensates for the climb.The hostel staff were a standout highlight, providing excellent assistance and guidance throughout my stay. Their warm and helpful attitude contributed significantly to the positive vibe of the hostel.Situated in the heart of the city, Planet Traveler Hostel provides easy access to daily events, enhancing the overall experience for those looking to immerse themselves in the local scene.One aspect worth noting is the presence of a dog on the premises. While some guests may find this endearing, it's essential information for those who may have concerns or preferences regarding animals.The hostel's heating system is commendable, ensuring a cozy and comfortable environment, especially during colder seasons. Additionally, the well-kept kitchen facilities offer a range of breakfast options.In conclusion, Planet Traveler Hostel stands out as a comfortable and enjoyable retreat, with a few considerations to bear in mind. If you seek a centrally located hostel with friendly staff and inviting amenities, this could be the perfect choice for your next travel escapade.Wishing you happy and memorable travels",

      "text": "Our whole experience was mainly tarnished by the behaviour and attitude of a male staff member (Robin). He was friendly at our check-in, but then his attitude completely changed. The first day he barged inside our room, a only Female dorm, while he was vacuuming without even knocking. Me and my friends were shocked since we were changing but thought we did not hear the knock and tried forgetting about it.He did the same the next day and when we confronted him he was arrogant and did not care at all. As a female I did not feel safe in the room and expected to have that male staff member barge in at any time, which is unfortunate since we made sure to pick an all female dorm. it is also located next to a church where there is a camp of homeless people and during the night there is a lot of noise just so you know. I really would have left a better review if did not have the experience i had with that male staff member. He does not reflect well on the hostel at all.",

The rooms were nice, and it was great to have a full sized locker and a 'private' bathroom for the room you were staying in. Also the single toilets along the corridor were useful for the times when someone was showering!The activities offered were popular and fun. My only 'issue' (and this is purely to do with me) is I would prefer it to be in a central location. I like to walk everywhere and it was a good 35/40 minutes to get to the entertainment district. But that is my personal preference; it is near a lot of different transport options!Printing was free, and the staff were always down for a chat/to offer advice. Also the luggage storage was great - I stayed over in Niagara for a night and came back late the following day, and the staff were welcoming/did not charge at all for luggage storage.I am coming back to Toronto at the end of the month and will probably stay here again!",

It had a big window and a full length mirror, as well as complimentary towels and bottled water which were a plus.The breakfast was great, unlimited bagels/bread/spreads/cereal/tea and coffee from 7am-1pm â€“ the wide duration for breakfast meant the kitchen area was never too packed as nobody was rushed to eat at a certain time. Thereâ€™s also free tea/coffee and popcorn available throughout the day, and youâ€™re able to use the fridge to store your own food and cooking utensils to cook for yourself.The staff are friendly and helpful and on hand to assist with any issues you might have. Theyâ€™ll also do things like print travel documents for you and give you local recommendations if you ask. I also heard they will book day trips to places like Niagara Falls on your behalf. There are activities every night if you donâ€™t know anyone and want to make friends, bingo was actually more fun than expected!The hostel itself is clean and modern with nice common areas â€“ the roof terrace being the highlight. Thereâ€™s a great view of the Toronto skyline. Location-wise itâ€™s very close to the trendy Kensington Market and you can walk to most places downtown within 30-40 mins, or get the subway/streetcars. The location means youâ€™re next to â€˜realâ€™ neighborhoods, as some parts of downtown can seem a bit sterile/band with all the skyscrapers and similar buildings. Also close proximity to places like Chinatown mean there is a range of affordable, good food nearby.Only slight downsides is there are no staff between 12-7am so if there was an issue in the night youâ€™d have to wait until morning. If you lose your keycard after midnight you wonâ€™t be able to get back in the building, so keep it safe if you have a few late night beers!Also the common areas are locked overnight so you canâ€™t get up in the middle of the night to get a glass of water etc. Additionally I was on the 1st floor and the music from the bars/clubs in the local Kensington Market area was quite loud from the positioning of my room, I could hear the bass which went on until the early hours. This wasnâ€™t a huge issue for me as I am a nightowl and was out most evenings myself, but if you want a quiet night this might be worth keeping in mind.Also my room had air conditioning but it wasnâ€™t possible to open the window, so it could feel a bit stuffy at times, however I understand this is most likely a security precaution as the room is at street level.Overall I had a great time in Toronto and Planet Traveler was a big part of that!",

It's perfect.  Literally around the corner from Kensington Market with its alternative cafes and bars.  20 minute walk will get you to King St West and half an hour to the harbourside (alternatively get the street car from a block away).  The hostel itself is spotless, well laid out, comfortable rooms with en suite shower rooms (in a small hallway so not off the room, if that makes sense).  Ground floor common area and kitchen, with breakfast included (plenty of cereals, bagels, toast, fruit) good for meeting people, as is the amazing roof terrace with stunning views of the city.

The walkway from room entrance to beds provides such an intelligent buffer taking away some of the awkwardness of getting ready in the morning while others are sleeping. The lockers in the walkway have outlets inside so you could keep your devices locked up while charging - Great modern design everywhere- Rooftop views are great!- Great amenities: breakfast, 3 Mac computers, communal TV in the lobby where I caught some Premier League matches and the latest Game of Thrones episode - Laundry seems cheap enough, though I didn't use it Cons: - It's a good but not GREAT location. Still a ~10 minute walk to the nearest subway station - This is a bit of a minor quibble, but not having access to a fridge between 12 Am - 7 AM was a bit inconvenient. I had some food products I wanted to travel with that needed to be refrigerated, but since I was checking out at 6 AM I had to take them out the night before. Maybe have a fridge on the rooftop with 24 hour access? I have no qualms about this being voted as one of the best hostels in North America. Very much recommended.",

      "text": "I stayed at The Planet Traveler for three nights at the end of April 2016 as a solo female traveler and had an amazing experience there. The hostel is situated inside a restored historic building and it is extremely eco-friendly with modern yet simple decor. The hostel is centrally located in a FANTASTIC neighbourhood on College Street and is within short walking distance (5 minutes) from the quirky, vibrant and diverse Kensington Market and Chinatown neighbourhoods where you will find lots of unique shops and a variety of ethnic restaurants. The hostel is also very close to Little Italy. You can get from the hostel to Toronto's downtown core area by foot (20-25 minute walk) or via a quick 10-minute streetcar ride (the streetcar stop for downtown is only a 5 minute walk from the hostel). Public transport is abundant and easy to find and two subway stations are also situated nearby (Bathurst and Spadina). The staff that I interacted with during my stay at Planet Traveler were so friendly and helpful and they always appeared to be in positive moods. They were very knowledgeable about the city and its attractions and neighbourhoods and how to get around from place to place. I liked that I was provided with a detailed tour of the building upon my arrival, which was great. I stayed in the 6-bed female dorm and although it was a small room and a little tight for six people, it was incredibly clean, the metal bunk beds were new and sturdy, and the mattresses and pillows were super comfortable. My bed was pre-made when I checked in which was a nice touch, and towels were provided. Each bed had two power outlets and a reading lamp, which made charging my phone in the nighttime very convenient. There were individual metal lockers located in a separate foyer area before entering the dorm (locks were provided as well) and the dorm had its own ensuite washroom with a shower. It was great to have a washroom so close-by! The common areas in the basement of the hostel were really comfortable and cozy, with lots of couches and wooden tree stump stools and a flat screen TV. There were MAC computers for guests to use and the fully equipped kitchen was spacious and new. The complimentary breakfast was served from 7 AM to 1 PM and it was tasty and satisfying enough for me. It consisted of bananas, a wide assortment of cold cereals with milk, bagels with jam and butter and coffee and tea. There were a couple of wooden picnic tables for seating. The Wi-Fi connection was very fast and strong everywhere in the building, which was great. The rooftop patio was one of my favourite parts about this hostel. There was an indoor portion with seating and a self-serve bar area and an outdoor area with wooden tables, potted plants, and couches. I loved sitting on the rooftop in the early mornings and evenings while admiring the beautiful panoramic views of Toronto's downtown cityscape and skyscraper buildings along with the CN Tower. There were also great views of College Street and the Little Italy neighbourhood from the other side of the patio. During most evenings, the hostel staff organized group activities for all of the guests on the rooftop patio. I participated in the trivia night and it was so much fun and it provided me with the opportunity to meet some cool new friends as well. Other amenities that the hostel offers include: laundry room (with a washer and dryer for a small fee); bicycle rentals for a fee; free and secure luggage storage room; and free local calls. I especially loved the relaxed, casual and laid-back atmosphere at the hostel and the friendly, social and welcoming vibe. This is not a party hostel and I enjoyed the fact that I could get a good night's sleep. I have nothing negative to say about my stay here and would highly recommend this hostel to anyone who is traveling to Toronto, and especially for independent and budget travelers!",

Room was clean and tidy, shared bathroom was well maintained - although 1 between 4 rooms didnâ€™t really seem enough in the mornings and an extra toilet accessible on each floor would have been good. Great rooftop views. Plentiful breakfast to set you up for the day. Make sure to book a parking space before you arrive - we had and had no trouble but there werenâ€™t that many spaces available so best to book to avoid disappointment",

      "text": "On the morning that I was checking out, one of the employees (Robin) proceeded to have a very aggressive argument with me over a check out procedure. I simply forgot to bring the duvet cover and my towel down from my third floor dorm. I was annoyed and said \"oh man, that's f***ing annoying, I have to go back up to the third floor\" all to myself, under my breath. He then accused me of treating him with \"disrespect\" saying he didn't have to put up with that kind of language directed at him, threatened to cancel my future booking with the hostel. I think this was racially motivated, especially after noticing the fact that all the guests who stayed there were white.Not wanting to further escalate the issue, I went back upstairs and got the duvet cover and towel. I came back down and tried to restart the conversation on a better foot, tried to shake his hand. He continued to act aggressively towards me, wouldn't shake my hand or even put the incident in a better perspective. I tried everything I could to make the situation better. He even tried to deny me the breakfast that was included in my stay, tried to kick me out right at that point after I brought down the duvet cover and towel. He then proceeded to cancel my future reservation...after I complied with all his demands. I was taken aback with the heat and aggression he decided to use in the conversation, tried several times to explain that I didn't direct what I said at him, to not take it personally. He continued to escalate the situation, talking over me, cutting me off mid-sentence, bullying me in front of other guests and even at one point put them in the position of a public jury as he called out over to where they were sitting and told them to give their opinion over the interaction. Needless to say, this was shocking, embarrassing and completely unnecessary. I literally went to my car shaking and started crying when I got in the car. I've never experienced such an incident with a hostel in my life.",

When I told him a couple times that he should not let the bartenders' dog eat his vomit he got aggressive, came to our table and slapped me in the face (with the hand he just threw up into) after what we got in a little fight. Personally that messed up my Toronto experience and I wish I would have chosen a different place to stay. Other than that the place has potential to be a good hostel and the rest of the stuff seems nice.",

One Saturday we were out and our friend moved out of our room for an email saying could we report to the reception we may need to be moved around. So myself and my partner went back to the hostel to find out the problem. They had double booked our room and told is they didn't have us in the system booked in until July and that we had not paid for 11 days (which is a load of crap) we paid on time every Tuesday and its quite expensive too. We were asked to show our receipts that we had paid so my partner went up to the room to get the receipts off the window sill to find that all our stuff had been packed up and put into the hall! He was horrified that they has touched our belongings. In the mean time I had found 2 receipts from the last two payments made. The staff were unable to accommodate us and told us to pack our bags and leave. We were told to pack our bags in the hall in front of everyone staying there which was so embarrassing making is out to have done something wrong! I've never been so humiliated. I only had great things to say about the hostel until the way we were treated that day. Overall the hostel is very clean. Rooms are very small and over priced.Out of principal I would not stay here again",

There's free wi-fi and nice modern kitchen but the dishwashers, free internet Mac terminals, free-call phone booths and modern climate control just all add to the cost of your stay which is embedded in the price.  There are plenty of travelers who don't need to make calls, don't need to use the computer for more than a couple of minutes at a time, don't use dishwashers, and don't stay in the room and yet they are paying for all these extra services.  Also the bar at the rooftop has music going till late that makes it hard for anyone below to sleep unless your room is at the back of building.All in all it's an OK place, they try pretty hard to make it communal and lots of travelers who are otherwise more inclined to not socialize will find this a great place, but really those who just want a cheap place to stay and are social to begin with, will find the extra costs associated with all the modern appliances quite annoying.Lastly, the room doesn't have any hooks, chairs, tables, no trash bin and nowhere but the floor to put your backpack/suitcase.  Hostel is also not close to TTC/train stations.",

The staff were absolutely vapid and actually made me cry due to how unwelcomed I felt.Be wary of shared dorms, as you will be charged extra if someone in your room stiffs them.This hostel should have been a great experience, due to the lovely building, however the staff was incredibly prejudice as well as many of the other guests made me feel as if I didnt belong, and was not good enough for the hostel. The \"rules\" changed on a case to case basis, as they flat out refused a fellow guest to extend, when others had been there for months.All in all I left and moved to a more friendly hostel in the neighbourhood.Unless you are a really cool hipster and instantly click with the staff, they will make your stay entirely uncomfortable and will condescend every move you make.I give this -100 as a rating, and will pass this on to everyone else I know looking to travel in Toronto.",

I really like here, the bunk beds are little noise, and the rooms don't have fresh air (meaning there is not windows that open) just an opening vent high above the door.. The private rooms share one bathroom which is again modern and well maintained. My first stay, I have to say was very pleasant. Not major complains. Thanks for the nice stay!!",

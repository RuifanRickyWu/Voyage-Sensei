So, Toronto Furnished Apartments and a snug 1 bedroom condo seemed to be the perfect solution. It was very convenient, in a well-managed and secure building, close to everything we wanted to be close to for our 'experiment'.  There were a few minor issues with the apartment, but these were all addressed in a very timely fashion by the properties manager whose office is very close by.  All-in-all a very positive experience for our first time experiment in short term property rental.",

The day before we arrived I had an email from them advising that the person in the apartment we'd booked wanted to stay another few nights, but they could put us in 140 Simcoe Street instead.  I was slightly worried but I need not have been, Tara in the office arranged everything perfectly with booking.com and 140 Simcoe, the concierge were expecting us and our keys were waiting.  It was seamless and the apartment was STUNNING!!!! I would definitely book with them again.  Beautiful hotel, wonderful stay.",

I stayed over a month and was generally comfortable in the one-bedroom with den apartment. The con is the living area is a bit dark. The window is not very big. The bathroom is quite small and has no window. There was only one light in the bathroom. I had to request a change in the shower curtain because low lighting. The bathroom needs to be upgraded. The kitchen is modern and has all the appliances including a double door fridge with an ice and water dispenser. There is a separate laundry with a washer/dryer combo.  The property manager was generally responsive (within 24 hours) to my queries. The building has 24 hours security.",

There's a lot of good restaurants and pubs around as well. Everything's within walking distanceI'd reccommend TFA to anyone.. Value for money",

Access to transport could not be better.  Osgoode subway station is less than an minute away and I found walking to trendy Queen Street W and Eaton Centre was a mere short stroll.  The location was perfect, but you want to know about the flat, don't you!Cleanliness: 10/10 ( and I'm really fussy)Amenities:  washer/dryer, iron, hairdryer, all excellent tried and tested.Wifi:  totally reliable The office for this flat is just downstairs next door.  Haim in the office could not have been more friendly and helpful.  This man could give a masterclass in customer service.My only criticism is that the couple next door could use some marital counselling or volume control, lol.  They won't be there when you arrive, so don't let that put you off.",

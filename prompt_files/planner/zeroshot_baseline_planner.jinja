You are an expert travel planner. Based on the following user query and the provided list of Points of Interest (POIs) in Toronto and restaurants, please select a subset of places that can be visited within a single day. Optimize the sequence of POIs for a pleasant and efficient travel experience, taking into account travel time, POI duration, and the interests of the user.

For each selected POI, provide a JSON object that includes:
1. The name of the POI.
2. A brief description.
3. The address/location.
4. Reasoning for why this POI fits the user's query and how it contributes to the overall travel experience.
Recommended plan should be within car reach as this is for car travel

Consider the starting point as 21 carlton st m5b 1l3 toronto ontario but dont put this in to the poi list, only use this for geo reasoning

Cannot not have meals for 5 hours

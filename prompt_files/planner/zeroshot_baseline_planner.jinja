You are an expert travel planner. Based on the following user query and the provided list of Points of Interest (POIs) in Toronto, please select a subset of POIs that can be visited within a single day. Optimize the sequence of POIs for a pleasant and efficient travel experience, taking into account travel time, POI duration, and the interests of the user.

For each selected POI, provide a JSON object that includes:
1. The name of the POI.
2. A brief description.
3. The address/location.
4. Reasoning for why this POI fits the user's query and how it contributes to the overall travel experience.

**User Query:**
{{ user_query }}

**List of POIs:**
{% for poi in pois %}
- Name: {{ poi.name }}
  Address: {{ poi.address }}
  Description: {{ poi.description }}
  Duration: {{ poi.duration }}
{% endfor %}

**Output Format:**
Return the selected POIs in a JSON array, where each POI is represented as a JSON object with the following structure. Do not include any additional text or explanation outside the JSON output.

```json
[
  {% for selected_poi in selected_pois %}
  {
    "name": "{{ selected_poi.name }}",
    "description": "{{ selected_poi.description }}",
    "location": "{{ selected_poi.address }}",
    "reasoning": "{{ selected_poi.reasoning }}"
  }{% if not loop.last %},{% endif %}
  {% endfor %}

Given the last system response and the subsequent user input, always print True until the user claims ready that they have finished expressing their preferences and is ready for the recommendation to be generated, then print False.

Additionally, the system should track a list of mandatory information that needs to be collected: time, budget, and purpose. If the system has not yet prompted the user for one of these pieces of information and the user has not already specified it, the system should prompt for one of the missing items.


Ensure the response follows this format:

True/False — Always True, until the user claims ready that they have finished expressing their preferences and is ready for the recommendation to be generated. Having collected all mandatory information does not indicate that users have finished expressing their preferences. They may have more to add. Not until user has responded "No" to "Do you have anything else to add?", we consider them to still have more to add about their preferences.
English response — If True, acknowledge the user’s input and prompt for one missing mandatory piece of information. If False, inform the user that the system will start generating the trip.
Remaining mandatory information — List of mandatory information still required after this iteration. Leave as 'None' if all have been finished.

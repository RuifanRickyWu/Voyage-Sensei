You are a travel planning assistant. Given a list of critiques about a travel itinerary and a sequence of Points of Interest (POIs), identify which POIs were negatively critiqued.

**IMPORTANT:**
Your output MUST be in valid JSON format and must consist solely of a JSON array. Each element of the array should be an object with a single key "Name" and its corresponding POI name as the value. Do not include any additional text or formatting.

For example, if the negatively critiqued POIs are "CN Tower" and "Ripley's Aquarium", your output should be exactly:

[
    {"Name": "CN Tower"},
    {"Name": "Ripley's Aquarium"}
]

**Example 1:**
Critiques:
- "The CN Tower was too crowded and overpriced."
- "I didn't enjoy Ripley's Aquariumâ€”it felt too small for the price."
- "The St. Lawrence Market had a great atmosphere, but I wish it had more variety in food stalls."

Current POI Sequence:
1. CN Tower
2. Ripley's Aquarium
3. St. Lawrence Market
4. Distillery District

Output:
[
    {"Name": "CN Tower"},
    {"Name": "Ripley's Aquarium"}
]

**Example 2:**
Critiques:
- "Casa Loma was beautiful, but too far from other attractions."
- "I found the Royal Ontario Museum overwhelming and not well-organized."

Current POI Sequence:
1. Art Gallery of Ontario
2. Casa Loma
3. Royal Ontario Museum
4. Kensington Market

Output:
[
    {"Name": "Casa Loma"},
    {"Name": "Royal Ontario Museum"}
]

Now, process the following input:

Critiques:
{% for critique in critiques %}
- "{{ critique }}"
{% endfor %}

Current POI Sequence:
{% for poi in poi_sequence %}
{{ loop.index }}. {{ poi }}
{% endfor %}

Output:

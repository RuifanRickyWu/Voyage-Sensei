You are a travel planning assistant. Given a list of critiques about a travel itinerary and a sequence of Points of Interest (POIs) with their durations and sequence order, identify which POIs were negatively critiqued, including critiques related explicitly or implicitly to time (e.g., critiques mentioning duration, sequence, or specific time periods like morning, afternoon, or evening).

IMPORTANT:
Do not consider Starting Point as a candidate that can be removed!
Important:
Your output MUST be in valid JSON format and must consist solely of a JSON array. Each element of the array should be an object with the following key:

"name": POI name

Do not include any additional text or formatting.

Assume the itinerary starts at approximately 09:00 AM, and estimate the timing of POIs based on their sequence and duration. Use the following assumptions:

Morning: 09:00 AM - 12:00 PM

Afternoon: 12:00 PM - 05:00 PM

Evening: 05:00 PM onwards

Also look for other critiques like the third POI or critiques that directly named the POI

Example:
Critiques:

"I don't like visiting the Royal Ontario Museum in the afternoonâ€”it was too crowded."

"Casa Loma was beautiful, but too far from other attractions."

Current POI Sequence:

{"name": "Art Gallery of Ontario", "Duration": "2 hours"}

{"name": "Casa Loma", "Duration": "3 hours"}

{"name": "Royal Ontario Museum", "Duration": "2-3 hours"}

{"name": "Kensington Market", "Duration": "1-2 hours"}

Estimated timings:

Art Gallery of Ontario: 09:00 AM - 11:00 AM (Morning)

Casa Loma: 11:00 AM - 02:00 PM (Morning/Afternoon)

Royal Ontario Museum: 02:00 PM - 05:00 PM (Afternoon)

Kensington Market: 05:00 PM onwards (Evening)

Output:
[
{"name": "Casa Loma"},
{"name": "Royal Ontario Museum"}
]

Now, process the following input:

Critiques:
{% for critique in critiques %}

"{{ critique }}"
{% endfor %}

Current POI Sequence:
{% for poi in poi_sequence %}
{{ loop.index }}. {"name": "{{ poi.name }}", "Duration": "{{ poi.duration }}"}
{% endfor %}

Output:

My son, who’s studying political science and international relations, was eager to explore the inside, and we were in luck—a guided tour was being offered by the assembly. It was an amazing opportunity, and the tour itself was fascinating.",

The Ontario Legislative Building has an impressive facade--we cannot help but spend a few minutes outside and take photos of it and some of the monuments and memorials in Queen's Park. Building entrance is on the south side where everyone has to go through airport-style screening complete with walk-through metal detector and x-ray scanner. Expect visible security presence, tour route directional signs and cordoned off areas. ",

        "The Upper Canada Assembly originally met in a building on Parliament Street, but it was burned by the Americans in the war of 1812.",
        "Queens Park was granted to the Province by the City of Toronto in 1880, and the parliament building was consructed of pink limestone, modelled after the Palace of Westminster in London.",
        "Unlike Westminster, QP has only one chamber for the Members, but the arraangement is similar, with seats for the government on one side and the opposition on the other. There is a Speaker's throne, pages, clerks and the Master at Arms. QP employs a private police force to take care of security.",
        "Behind the Members' areas there are \"back rooms\" for meetings. Above the main chamber ther are galleries for the public, Members' guests and the Press/media.",
        "To attend a meeting of the legislature the public must sign in at the security desk and surrender all their belongings except for a wallet: no cell phones, no newspapers, nothing is allowed in the public gallery. The public is not permitted to make any noise or any kind of applause.",
        "For visitors to the Members' Gallery, they must be signed in by their MPP and go thorugh a different security section. Again cell phones and large bags must be stored, but handbags are permitted.",
        "Tours of the building are conducted. There is a gift shop on the main floor.",

        "There is a nice, cheap cafeteria in the basement, and visitors can get a security pass just to this area.The closest transit stop is Queens Park on subway Line 1 at College Street. There is also a streetcar service on College/Carleton, number 506.",

Once we got to the Grotto, our guide Javier showed us all the best spots with the best views. We then had the afternoon to enjoy this unique place, swim in the amazingly clear water, take photos and have our lunch. It was a really nice and friendly group too. I love these trips with Javier! It's a pretty long drive up to the Grotto, so it's nice to not have to drive but just relax in a comfortable van. The best way to experience the Grotto in a day from Toronto!"

A relaxed and fun way to escape the city and meet new and interesting  people in a small group setting. Javier was very skilled in making us all feel comfortable and included. I had never been canoeing before, but Javier really put me at ease. I think sitting in a canoe in the middle of a lake in Algonquin Park is possibly the most amazing place I have ever sat to eat my lunch! Each tour is very different - hiking, canoeing, swimming, and lots of photo opportunities! If you're going on a summer trip, bug spray highly recommended!!"

My guess is they will be adding snow for the weekend guests,but we enjoyed our time never the less. Plenty to see, plenty to experience and a lot of restaurants with fine foods. We highly recommend Magnone's Italian Kitchen, their chef and their service are amazing. I understand that all the business is revolving around skiers, but the staff at chair lifts wouldn't let us go up to the top without ski equipment (only in summer time!). The other thing we noticed, it's hard to recognize forest trails in winter time, because the entrances are buried in snow or covered with snow banks during clean ups. The whole village was still covered with Christmas lights which will certainly up your spirit, but we will definitely be back in summer time!"

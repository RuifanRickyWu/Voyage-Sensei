I always take photos of my hire car at collection. They charged me €460 and have yet to send me any correspondence (they said I would have an email within the hour). This on 19.4.24. I travel regularly to Spain, am aware of this type of scam, but have never had any trouble before this. It’s fraudulent behaviour…Should have read Trust Pilot reviews, says it all."

        "We rented a vehicle from Thrifty on February 12th at Sky Harbor and through slight of hand at check-in ended up paying $244,93  plus 15%  tax for lost damage waiver (coverage I personally have on my insurance). I told the attendant that i did not need it. However he charged me anyway and did not show me a sign contract, simply printed a form and put it in a folder. I did not think much about as i assumed that upon return on February 19th that i would be printed off a receipt with all charges shown. When we went to pick up the Nissan Rogue it was full of scratches and dents. We asked the attendant to walk around and do  a write up (it was Super Bowl weekend and there were not many vehicles around). He flippantly told us to takes photos as evidence (very unprofessional). Upon our return on February 19th, the attendant in the garage told us that they don't print out invoice/receipts like they used to but will email the invoice. being trusting and time challenged we didn't think that this was a problem. Upon receiving the invoice by email the next day with the charges, we now see it as a set up. Recommend to all travelers to Phoenix, stay away from Thrifty at the airport."

        "My colleague and I chose to book a car with Elite GTA to drive us from my home to Pearson Airport because their price was comparable (within $5-$10) to other companies.  The driver was so kind, calling me 10 minutes before pick up to see if we wanted a coffee (it was the morning and he was going to stop to get coffees if we wanted one). The ride was smooth and the driver was very pleasant. We opted to take the 407 to save time and the 407 charge was pretty much that charged by the 407 (no mark-up, or very little by Elite GTA).  We were very satisfied with the service that we booked a ride for our return from the airport. For our return trip with Elite GTA, we were greeted by another driver who, like the first driver, showed up a few minutes early to the airport to pick us up. He texted me the door # that we were to greet him. The SUV was limousine-like, very fancy!! The driver had water, cookies, and mints for us which were pleasantly unexpected! Loved their service- would definitely book again with Elite GTA."

During my short ride he mentioned another client and that tip should reflect his waiting time, very unprofessional.

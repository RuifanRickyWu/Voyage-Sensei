It has looked pretty much the same since then, with its doors open to locals for worship much of the ensuing years. My Great Grandfather, who lived in St Lawrence Hall for the entirety of the depression and then some, spent his Sundays there and his wife, my gran, made oies for their suppers.  Excellent acoustics, if you're lucky, you might catch a practice or a concert there...lovely architecture,  a calm and tranquil spot to reflect, and the gardens next door in the park are gorgeous. Well worth a visit. "

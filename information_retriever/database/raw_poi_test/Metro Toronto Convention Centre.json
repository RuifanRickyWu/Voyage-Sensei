It covers a square city block with hotels that include restaurants and bars at each end,I don't know if they are actually affiliated with the center or separate entities. The place is massive with 3 huge areas: 1 for assemblies, an exhibition hall that's bigger than the assembly hall and what looked like it could be an area used for a sporting event but was vacant during my time there. There are then 7 other levels of meeting and break out rooms. There were over 7500 people attending the Parliament and the facilities ( common areas, meeting rooms, restrooms) were always clean ( this was a week long event). Especially impressed by the clean restrooms with the huge crowd we had. There are at least 5 hotels and more B&B's with in easy walking distance of the center. A great place for a convention. Then there are all the amazing restaurants also with in an easy walk plus a food court across the street. There were food vendors at our event and also banquet facilities. We did need ID to enter but that may not be the case for a concert or sporting event. The Parliament did provide free secure wi-fi but not sure if the center itself does. May depend on the event."

In one section of the building the floor numbers were reversed.  Instead of the floors at the bottom starting at one and then going up in number, the numbers got higher as you descended.  Perhaps, this was intended to reflect Dante's Inferno, where the lower levels actually resembled the hotter and hottest parts of hell.

Service is efficient and the food was good! One of the best features of the Metro Convention Centre is that there is indoor access from Union Station, from both GO and VIA trains -  perfect for bad weather. I've arrived by UP Express from the airport and walked to a previous Cardinal's Dinner while a rainstorm raged outside - so helpful. The south-side parking lot is wonderful for those who are heading for the Gardner Expressway - the first traffic light south on leaving on the south lot takes you to Lakeshore Boulevard - that helps to make leaving downtown faster! Parking is close to the CN Tower, the  Aquarium, hockey arena, downtown in general."

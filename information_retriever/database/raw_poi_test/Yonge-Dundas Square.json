There is a fair bit to see here - The Eaton Centre, a busy shopping centre boasting more than 230 retailers and dining options - A performance at the Elgin and Winter Garden Theatre, or a “banquet burger”—at Fran’s Restaurant and Bar, which stakes a claim to inventing both the burger and the term. If you do not mind heavy crowds and loud performance street music then you might just enjoy yourself."

The place is not very beautiful, but what it is, it is totally alive. There is always something going on there."

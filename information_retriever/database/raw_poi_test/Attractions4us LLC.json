We felt that while the visuals were nice to look at, the actual story was not. For the amount we paid the length was quite short and the tale was unremarkable. The building it took place in had lumps in the wall for pillars and pipes that distracted from the visuals. No one was monitoring the area so there were children running around disrupting the experience. We had gone to Van Gogh and thought it was a stunning retelling of the life and art of Van Gogh. Thought we’d enjoy this experience for the same reason. King Tut paled in comparison and unfortunately would not recommend."

I paid the extra for the VIP package and received nothing except for my landyard and a cushion to sit on during this 30 minute very boring movie and there was less than a half of room with fake artifacts.  I came to see it from Goderich so it also cost me the price of a train ticket to get down to see it. They make it look so good on their facebook page but when you arrive its shocking to see how little this presentation consists of. We also noticed the staff wouldn't look us right is the eyes as they probably realize how they are ripping people off.  They should be investigated and charged for all the money they have stolen from people thinking this is a one of a kind show worth seeing ..... which it is definitely not  The pictures I attached is basically the whole display .....not much . Hopefully all these bad reviews found here will help you save money as they keep deleting the bad reviews and keeping the good ones that were probably written by their staff as there is nothing good about this display and taking good money from people just to see the expressions of shock when we realized we had just been ripped off"

It was only 12:10 (our start time was 12:30pm) So, an early start time only meant we could get into the \"holding pen\" early. I had no idea it was a \"show\" with start times. The fact that you could get in up to an hour early led me to believe that it was a self guided walk through and being let in early meant you would start walking through earlier and would maybe have more time to peruse everything.

Thankfully, I found a handful of folding chairs tucked away in a dark corner and we sat. ",

So I popped back out and grabbed a couple of chairs for my mum and my aunt. I figured we surely wouldn't be there for long, imagining that we would move on into other rooms. Alas, no. We sat there for 40 minutes watching what essentially amounted to a sort of realistic cartoon depicting the journey that the ancient Egyptians believed a dead pharaoh would take through the underworld. It had virtually nothing to do with King Tutankhamen in particular and certainly had nothing to do with the discovery or excavation of his tomb. I imagined seeing the pyramids and the endless dunes and images of Carter's expedition.",

Instead, it was a 40 minute animation-type video without much in the way of interesting facts. It was like watching a glorified TV show, and one that wasn't very interesting.

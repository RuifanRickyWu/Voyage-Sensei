Gabby was friendly and knowledgeable and gave us some history along with showing us the sights.  A great tour and a lot of fun!"

I had a free day and decided to choose the 'best of Toronto' tour and was lucky to be guided by the owner herself. I had an amazing time discovering the city, from the AGO museum, to the best Margarita in town,to the market where i could find the best mustard(!), even giving me great tips of where I should go in the evening for some live folk music - Gabrielle tailored the tour to my specific tastes and I had the most amazing time discovering a new city, and made a new friend too. I highly recommend booking a tour with Guided Toronto!!!"

Having lived here for 7 years I thought I knew all there was to know about my neighborhood, but I was very wrong. It was amazing to learn so much, uncover many hidden gems, streets and be lucky to have a tailored tour to our interests. Of course, all the while getting our steps in for the day. My advise is, take this fun tour and don't forget to bring your walking shoes! "

        "My husband and I had 24 hours to make the most of our trip, and opting for Guided Toronto was the best choice we could have made. From booking the tour up until the meet up, everything was coordinated and communicated efficiently.  We chose the free walking guided tour: ARTS, FOOD, CULTURE. And yes, you read that correctly, it was FREE!Gaby, our guide, was on time and had great energy from the start. Upon meeting her we knew we were in good hands. She was super knowledgeable and we learned a lot of historical facts. She walked us through a lot of sites off the beaten path as well as iconic landmarks. Overall it is a 2 hour walking adventure so be sure to wear comfy shoes and bring water!Of note, this tour is rain or shine. It happened to be torrentially raining the morning of our tour. But sure enough, Gaby reached out to ensure that the tour would go on. Luckily the day cleared up and we were able to explore the sites as planned. We would highly recommend choosing Guided Toronto if you're looking for a real and fun way to explore the city. It truly was a memorable experience. PS: This particular tour is F R E E. Be a decent human being and leave your guide a tip."

She's clearly passionate about her city and it's history and was able to answer all of the questions we threw at her. The tour was the perfect length in both distance and time, and was thoroughly engaging throughout. The group sizing is also perfect with a maximum of 15 participants in any tour which is intimate enough to always be engaged whilst allowing you to mingle amongst yourselves when walking between locations. I'd highly recommend Guided Toronto to anyone visiting the city, or looking to learn a little more about where they call home."

Gaby is extremely knowledgeable - not only about things like the history, significance and stories behind various attractions, but also other more niche, quirky information that I don't think you'd get elsewhere, e.g. great insight into the artists and murals featured on Graffiti Alley. She also gave me great ideas for places to go and things to see in the city. I would definitely recommend this tour as a great way to get to know the city with a fantastic tour guide! "

We packed so much into the few hours it was just fab. (Grange Park, Art Gallery, Chinatown, new Town Hall, Osgoode Hall and loads more)  Gabby our guide, was so friendly, knowledgeable and great fun...I got the feeling she tailored the trip based on the groups interests as we went.  Be sure to have your walking shoes on....and best of all...I’m sure Guided Toronto are doing a promotion at the moment on this tour....Make sure to put this on the top of your agenda!  "

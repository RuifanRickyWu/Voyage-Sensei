I see others with similar issues and I think the company is now out of business, but the sketchy part is they are still showing as open on their website and taking people’s $. Also unfortunately it looks like the chef passed away January 2021 according to FB so the business is definitely closed. I am out over $300."

Due to COVID-19 this tour was cancelled but the website was not updated to reflect this. 5 people showed up that evening (we didn't know the other 3) and waited for Chef Scott to show up. He didn't. Someone found a # for him and by chance he was closeby. He came by, apologized profusely for the error, even offered us a whole lobster to take home. He promised to contact everyone within a few days to reschedule or refund us. It is now mid-November and after multiple attempts to get in touch with Chef Scott we are unable to do so. I feel ripped off and very disappointed because I am a regular visitor to St. Lawrence Market and I was very much looking forward to experiencing it from a different perspective. I hope the others who showed up that evening had better luck getting reimbursed than I did. I would not recommend Toronto Food Tours."

When we fly out of Toronto, we make a point of staying an extra day to enjoy the city and take a tour with Toronto Food Tours (we have done eight tours so far).  We loved the Ossington Strip tour.  It included an excellent Spanish Tapas restaurant, a Japanese fusion restaurant and a classic Indian grill.  All of the selections were excellent and were paired with a cocktail or wine selection.  Chef Scott has great stories about the neighborhood, the Toronto food scene and the \"chef\" business.  It was a great evening and a chance to sample some of the best that Toronto has to offer.  I recommend it to anyone interested in getting to know another great foodie destination in Toronto."

We’ve been to old Chinatown many times and have tried lots of interesting food but figured we could always learn something new, and did we! Even though he gave us the chance to override his choices we stuck with them and he didn’t disappoint. The duck...the squid...the seafood fried rice was a surprise of the first order. The restaurants we went to were places we would not have gone to but oh we were glad we did and we will go back. We then went to a dim sum restaurant. We told Chef Scott we’ve done dim sum for a LONG time but what we ate was so fresh—not like any of the same items we’d had before. All freshly made, not frozen pre-made. Next we had the Chinese version of porchetta (Italian roast pork/pig). Off the chart. Going through a Chinese (oriental) market was a learning experience. He always had stories and information that were appropriate, important, informative and funny.",

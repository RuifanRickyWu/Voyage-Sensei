        "My husband and I recently visited Lula’s while in Toronto for a couples getaway. We reserved a table for their Pre Fixe Dinner and Show package and absolutely enjoyed our time. The lesson was fun. The people we’re friendly. And while yes there are “ professionals” who have been going and dancing for quite some time showing off their moves, it did not intimidate us one bit to get out on the dance floor ourselves. And quite honestly we enjoyed watching the regulars while sitting down and catching our breath. Time honestly flew by! Our dinner reservation was for 7:30pm and next thing we knew it was 1am! We will definetly return! "

(Jerk chicken was yummy but pretty spicy, calamari were perfect, crab cake was delicious and desserts were a hit at our table.  8 people all enjoyed their meal.   Salsa dance lesson was great.   DJ music was fun;  the 12 pc band was FANTASTIC!    Dance floor very crowded.  Would be nicer to have a bit of room to dance.  All in all, a very fun, entertaining evening.    Waiters Julio and Lulu were both terrific!    Mostly filled with under 40 year olds, but any age fit in."

        "Lula Lounge is fabulous. I have been to Salsa Saturday twice recently, once with my husband for birthday dinner and dancing, and once with my girlfriends for a fun night out. I had an amazing time both times! Such fantastic music; dancing to their live bands is such a treat and so much fun. The staff at Lula are wonderful, always working hard to make sure everyone has a good time. I want to especially mention Sara and Melany in the coat check who were lovely and very helpful, and kept our stuff safe and secure so we could dance and not worry about anything! The wait staff and bartenders are also super, and their margaritas are my favourite in the city! My ONLY criticism is that the break between band sets feels very long, although the DJ certainly kept us all dancing during that time.  ",

In total, this was a $200 bill.  I can think of many amazing meals to be had in Toronto for that amount.  ",

For $54 you get a 3 course meal and the choices and portions were perfect. At 9pm there was a group Salsa lesson on the dance floor. Perfect for those of us who have never Salsa'd before. It was great fun and the floor was full. The remainder of the evening had live music, drinking wonderful cocktails and great friends. I highly recommend it for any occasion. BUT if you are interested in dinner and making a night of it, MAKE RESERVATIONS! When we left there was a line up at the door and after 8 don't expect a table anytime soon."

The 3 course dinner and salsa dance lesson was well worth the price. Live music played during dinner. Only critique was that the dance instructor was hard to see due to being on the floor too and the entire restaurant taking the class. Wish she was standing on a platform to better see her salsa steps. Great place for a Bachelorette party! Overall, a great time with awesome food and dancing!"

        "I just attended a yearly benefit at the Lulu Lounge! I was there 2 years ago and the food was amazing!  I am gluten free and lactose intolerant and a foodie so I am not your average patron! However I did bring other people with me that can eat anything on the menu! The offerings are slim and with the new prices of food this was not a cheap dinner! Most in my party ordered the same meal as the other alternative meal we were told is too spicy! The Vegetarian Red Pepper Tamales did not taste like tamales at all. It was like glue! The guacamole tasted old and they also added quinoa! You already had a starch why not add a salad with that? Perhaps they should rethink their menu! It could be fabulous as was the event!"

The friendly staff work super fast...the sound is brilliant and the menu changes seasonally. In the past year or so, they've literally raised the roof, put in new bathrooms and repainted. I attend countless concerts there every year and have produced and hosted events at Lula as well. There's no place like home!"

        "I've only been here once as I was visiting the city- and it was SO much fun.  I went with my boyfriend who loves to latin dance.  I was nervous as we had taken lessons 4-5 times prior to this and I was feeling intimidated.  But don't.  There is a lesson and there is a wide variety of dancers.  I enjoyed watching some couples who clearly have been dancing for awhile and others who definitely had two left feet but I think we all had a lot of fun listening to the music.  And the band was amazing.  The energy was electric.  ",
        "A really really good time, thank you Lula Lounge for a fun night out in the city."

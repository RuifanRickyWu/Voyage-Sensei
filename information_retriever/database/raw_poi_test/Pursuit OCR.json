  "description": "Pursuit OCR is Canada's largest indoor obstacle course! With over 30,000 square feet of adventures inside, you'll be laughing and sweating for hours! Our facility is 18+ (unless arranged through a schoolboard arranged visit) and is designed to let adults feel like a kid again. Our obstacle course is unlike anything you've ever seen at two and a half football fields in length (750 feet/230 meters). When was the last time you got to play in a ball pit? Well we've 100,000 balls four and a half feet deep! We are also home to the first ever indoor pedal powered Drift Trike raceway! Get your Super Mario Kart on and pedal your way around our separate raceway (included with admission) winding your way under our obstacle course! Also onsite is a free mini arcade when you need to catch your breath. If you're looking for a fun fitness based outing, you're coming to the right place!",

        "That checked us in was so nice and accommodating. However the person that was giving us instructions introduced the Assistant Manager Ashley who threw her hand up with her back Turned towards us. She didn’t take any interest in even making eye contact with us. We then begin to see her in areas we were in like she was looking for something to find fault in what we were doing. She was so nice and pleasant with the other guest. However as we encountered her and she saw that we were not pleased with her demeanor towards us she started trying to engage in conversation and we told her at that point we didn’t want to talk to her she was not interested in talking",
        "In the beginning. We felt uncomfortable being there around her it was not inviting. I would not recommend to have any interaction with her as African Americans which she is also because she definitely treated us like we were not wanted there."

The most incredible staff and facilities. Inclusive, bright, happy place for all fitness levels and comfort. They have navigated the shutdowns with such grace and attention to health and safety of everyone who comes through their doors. Grab your tickets soon, because they are in high demand!

Left the facility with many fun, lasting memories and definitely can't wait to be back! Feeling the pain today but how often can you work out without even knowing it?! I'd definitely encourage everyone to go try it at least once! You'll become addicted!

You can finish the obstacle course really quickly and you probably won't resort to the course for the majority of the time.",

They also run fitness classes, but we didn't partake in them. The price isn't bad. We got a discount off the usual price because we're first responders. It's nice to be recognized. I'll definitely come again."

We both have shoulder injuries so we opted out of a few of the areas which is cool in itself that there is no pressue to do it all.  There were many areas to rest and overlook the fantastic facility.  The staff are incredibly helpful and very personable.  At only $20/person it was a great way to play and find that inner kid again while getting some fitness in.  Next time we will bringing a group with us.

Once you walk in, there is a line up but don't let that fool you.  Just head over to the iPad and sign a waiver first.  After you are done, then line up to buy your ticket(s).  Do NOT forget to bring your driver licence or else you are not getting in.  I waited approximately 5-7 mins. only, it moves pretty fast.  They have change rooms and lockers (bring you own lock).  Once you are inside, ask the friendly staff where to start. Now, it's not like Ninja Warrior, no Salmon ladder or Sea of poles, etcq.  This is from beginners to advance levels.  Some obstacles are easy and others are challenging.  All participants are positive and encouraging.  Learn from each other and have fun.  (Upper body strength is encouraged).  $20.00 for a Day pass and you can stay as long as you like.  You get your money's worth.  I don't remember the last time I paid $20 and have that much fun.  This is great place with a group."

        "I booked Persuit for my 30th birthday because who doesn't want to feel like a kid again?  Everyone, including myself were having so much fun at this place.  It is jungle gym designed for adults.  Lots of obstacle courses, jumping and racing.  Total package for a fun and active time.  The ticket you purchase is for the entire day however, after a few hours you will be tiered so don't plan to be here the entire time.  They do sell snacks and there is a water fountain for use however, in terms of actual food there are no option at the place as well as in the neighborhood.  This is something that I think they need to look at and improve on.  You get super hungry after a few hours of playing around.  Recommend, until they figure this part out bring along some snacks for yourself to keep full and energized."

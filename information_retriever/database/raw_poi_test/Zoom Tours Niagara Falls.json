The driver took 10 stops for pickups which made the trip travel time to 3 hrs instead of 1.5 hrs. Will not recommend anyone to use zoom travel."

The shuttle had spots that they would pick up and it was nice that they waited for those that missed it the first time. The bus ride didn’t seem that long. The tour guide/ driver was very knowledgeable and funny. The boat ride to see it up close was beautiful and absolutely breathtaking. The views from the hotel dinner was the perfect location to see the view. Maple syrup tasting was a cool new experience. The buffet was good, plenty of options. Seeing the Niagara Falls at night was a totally different experience. Highly recommend this tour to everyone! Worth it!"

We loved the small group tour with 7 of us, it made it easy to maximise time at each stop. Our driver Garry was experienced and skilled in driving in heavy traffic. We found his advice helpful on where to go to catch the cruise, where to meet him and when, where to get good photos. The highlight of our day was the fallsview lunch which we booked with our tour as an add on option.. The lunch at Fallsview grand buffet was very good and the views across the falls are truly awesome. Highly recommend booking Zoom tours to Niagara Falls."

We were picked up bang on time. At this point I should mention Johnny. He was our tour guide and he was absolutely fantastic. Involved the group, made everyone welcome and cracked one liners all trip. He’s obviously a clever guy because he had all the info too. I can honestly say he made the trip for us. ",

        "I went on the Day Tour to Niagara Falls that included sightseeing and the boat trip. Overall, the trip was excellent, and our driver and tour guide, Dwayne, was fantastic (if you’re reading this Zoom Tours, then give him a promotion!). ",
        "I have to say I was a bit nervous after reading the small number of negative reviews on here, but honestly, I can’t fault the trip. The only minor issue was that we were not collected from our hotel of choice, and instead asked to meet downtown at another hotel. This wasn’t a huge issue for me personally, and is totally understandable given the need to balance the needs of the schedule, but this could perhaps be an issue for others.  ",
        "Other than that, the day went really smoothly, and I really enjoyed Dwayne’s excellent commentary throughout the day on the social history and geography of the region. On arrival in Niagara we were on the boat within minutes, and then we had 90 mins after that to explore the area before heading off on the bus to a series of other interesting stops. Dwayne also went above and beyond at Niagara on the Lake, risking the wrath of local residents and traffic control to take us direct into the centre of the town so that we could enjoy an extra 30 minutes of sight-seeing and   ice creams.  The circling community transport minibus (official town transport) made our military-style fly-by extraction onto our minibus from the main street very exciting.  Finally, despite some pretty awful traffic, we arrived back in Toronto by 5:30. One of the best tours I’ve ever been on – I would highly recommend it."

We requested a hotel pickup but were told after the fact where we had to meet the bus.  This required an uber ride to a coffee shop downtown.  Traffic in downtown Toronto is the worst I have ever experienced.  The Boat ride was the highlight but the other stops did not offer much.  Better off just booking the boat ride on your own.  We opted for the optional buffet at the Sheraton.  It was a nice buffet but not sure it was worth $50 per person.  The tables they have set aside for the tour group did not offer a view of the falls.  We did not make it back to the pickup point until after midnight then had to wait for a ride back to the hotel."

Taking the tour really saved om the hassle of parking and just maximized time at all the locations. It was easy to get picked up from hotel in the mini bus. It was super comfortable even though it was a full bus. We loved seeing Niagara during the day. Have a great buffet dinner at the 13th floor of sheraton overlooking the falls and get back out there for touring the parkway. And it was a treat to see it at night with the falls being illuminated. Of course, we had to do the hornblower cruise and get right into the falls and that was SUPER fun. Recommend waterproof shoes LOL. But eventually we dried up! 10 out of 10 and would do it again!",

I was asked to take a cab to where he was waiting which was very far from my location and costed me extra dollars. The driver mentioned he would refund me the cab fee for the trouble he caused. When I got in the taxi the driver called and changed the location and was pressurizing me to come fast siting 45 kms away. He was concerned that other tourists are waiting and it was not my mistake he missed the stop. Then I finally boarded the bus and I did not enjoy any part of the travel.

        "A terrific tour by day and night to Niagara Falls and the region around. Johnny, our tour guide, was fun and knowledgeable, sharing a lot of stories along the way. We passed through different areas of the Niagara region, including vineyards, a small chapel, and going through Niagara-on-the-Lake, first stopping for a brief view of the Niagara river, with the US on the other side and the opening to Lake Ontario, and then a 40 minute break in town for a brief stroll on the main street, including a stop for Ice Cream, admiring all the nice buildings and flowers and some souvenir watching. The final stop at Niagara Falls was all that was advertised. The Hornblower ride was quick to get on and then the ride into the falls is marvelous. We ended up adding the buffet dinner at the Sheraton in the end and didn't regret it. The views to the falls and city from the balcony are great. The food choice was nice, and saves you time. A brief stroll through the center, including the crazy Clifton Hill ('Las Vegas' is more and more inflated with extravagance) before the night show (glowing falls and a bit of fireworks) and heading back to Toronto."

        "We were picked up on time from designated location, everything was organised well and Gary our guide was informative. Air conditioner on the bus was not working properly so hot 2 hour trip there and back to Toronto. Some confussion for us and the other passengers at Niagara Falls as the bus had no number or markings and it was not the only black bus. All in all we had a great day any gluten intolerant travellers the Hard Rock Cafe at Niagara Falls has a variety of selections and the nachos is awesome. They were the fourth restaurant we tried."

        "Unfortunately due to bad planning on the tour operators behalf this day was spoilt. After travelling to Canada from England to experience a once in a life time visit to Niagara falls, the trip was left very short and disappointing. ",
        "I booked the day and night trip to make the most of our time visiting. ",
        "I opted for this particular tour as it was sold as everything I needed it to be. ",
        "I was grateful that it had the option of hotel pick up as I was travelling with my elderly mother. ",
        "The days leading up to the trip I had tried to contact to get confirmation for pick up times with no success. I then had to ask the hotel were I was staying for help. They eventually got through and I was told at 8pm the night before they were still deciding and I will get an email. ",
        "I was then email to let me know that we would be getting picked up at 1pm at a different location 15 minute walk away. ",
        "We arrived at the location with plenty of time to spare. 1pm came and went with no update. Around 1.20pm I tried calling the contact number again with no luck. ",
        "1.35pm I was sent a message to say the bus had broken down and a replacement would be with us in 10 minutes. Another 20 minutes passed before the bus arrived. We were then told that they were late due to road closures and no mention of a breakdown. ",
        "We spent the next 2 hours picking people up and the driver then deciding he wanted to drive a different bus. (not because of breakdown issues, but because he prefered the other bus) so a detour to change busses. ",
        "Traffic was bad as it was Canada day which is understandable but this was the constant excuse given. What I don't understand is why if you are aware that it will be a busy day did the company not plan for this, setting off earlier or even better not to take bookings on what I can only think is one of the busier days of the year! ",
        "Ali our driver, tried his best to keep our spirits up an was informative but after hours of detouring, picking people up, changing buses, traffic, and having to drive past places on the itinerary and not getting to enjoy it, everyone on board was extremely deflated. ",
        "We stopped at a few locations and was given 3-5 mins max to jump out , get a picture and return to the bus. Other locations we just drove past and couldn't get out!!",
        "We did not arrive to Niagara falls until 7.15pm!! We were rushed to the boat, having to run to get there! ",
        "I had separately booked to go on the zipline and the ferris wheel which we missed out on both because of time!! And I can not get a refund for these! ",
        "Others on the bus had booked dinner and were rushed to eat as fast as possible! We then got to watch the fireworks at 10pm and were told to be back at the meeting point for 10.10pm. ",
        "It is very busy at that time and again this was rushed! We had to push through crowds to get back. When we got to the meeting point the driver was not there. I walked further down to see he was already on the bus and driving out the car park! ",
        "Another older couple had not returned yet and I don't understand why he wasn't at the meeting location! We had to then tell him to go and find them!",
        "When we arrived back in the city at midnight. I was again shocked and disappointed to be dropped off at the location we were collected from!! The roads were clear and no longer closed so there was no excuse! To drop off two women in a location they don't know in the pitch black in the middle of the night with no phone battery is very irresponsible! (Especially when again, we were meant to be dropped at our hotel door!)",
        "This trip was meant to be a surprise but with all the messing around I had to explain to my mother and the surprise was spoilt. ",
        "Completely let down by Zoom Tours! Bad organisation and lies! What was meant to be a fantastic trip was filled with lies, missed opportunities and disappointment."

        "This tour said it would pick up @ any toronto pearson airport hotel. My hotel was on their list on the app getyourguide where i booked. Friday around 2 pm (the day before) they call saying they didn't have my hotel location yet for pick up. my tour started at 1 & i get a message 6 pm saying something along the lines of I need to meet @ Pearson to not delay departure times longer due to traffic &my pick up time was now 1:30,& i had go to be there 15 minutes early. they said to take the free hotel shuttle to get to the airport. I wait their approx an hour early so I wasnt late. two others on the tour were waiting. 1:30 comes I call to see where they were as they told us be early, so you think they would have done the same. The person tells us \"oh hes delayed in traffic downtown itll be 10 more minutes. ",
        "Our guide was Syed.. we board & there were guests on alresdym What really up I find out he already gave info to them &  he keeps saying \"remember I said\" to things, and no I don't remember since you only told part of the guests. So I missed that info. I dont think any info should have been given until everyone was boarded. He also went through his housekeeping speech & to be on time when another group comes on. so 3 times total was annoying to hear repeated. He had a very thick accent so it was hard to understand sometimes ",
        "My booking showed the bus came with free wifi. Yet he refused to give us the wifi password. ",
        "I read reviews that people have gotten free maple syrup testing so I was excited for that but we did not get this. ",
        "On our way he kept saying \"so I've drove a lot of famous people but I chase the money & don't get it but don't chase the famous people cause I don't care, & they come to me\" or something like this, yet he kept name dropping celebrities he's drove for, so for someone who \"doesn't care\" he sure talked about it a lot. ",
        "We were told specific times to be back at the bus for the certain sights. Once we had maybe 15 minutes & yet these people decide to be 6 minutes late. I don't know why we didn't just leave if they couldn't respect the times given when he told us multiple times to be on time. ",
        "We were given about an hour to go view the falls before the boat, & he refers to the falls as \"the stupid falls\" i was very upset by this bc you are dissing one of the wonders of the world & we paid money to see this, as a guide you should be positive about the sight not saying negative things. Syed didn't bother walking around with us either. He continually told us \"no snacking or eating because the meal is a buffet and anything you don't eat is served the next day\"",
        "He then asked who was all going to the dinner, & I felt very singled out when I didn't raise my hand & he said to me \"why not it's only 60$\" like he just wanted more of my money. I would rather go explore, & I have allergies so it was safer for me not to. He also told the people for supper \"tell them your with zoom tours not me, I have a bad rep with them\" ",
        "As this was an evening tour I was under the impression we would be taking the boat tour when the falls were light up and for the fireworks but this was not the case. ",
        "Syed recommend a spot to stand to view the light show and fireworks up higher on a platform close to the hotel the guests were having dinner at. He told us \"oh if you don't stand here you will regret it\" I had made my way over there thinking this would be good and stood in the corner. Well part of the falls were blocked off by the info center building, & the part you could see had all the light posts on the edge of the sidewalk so trying to get pics they showed up.I felt so far away. I ignored his suggestion, & go down to the barricade where there wasn't as much of a crowd, & I loved that the view was so much closer. Then he asked where I stoo once I got back I told him I didn't like the view up higher & he almost seemed annoyed I didn't listen. ",
        "Before we went on the hornblower, we were told to meet at 10:10. He said there will be an alarm at 9:50, to give a 10 minute warning, & its only a 5 minute show & to meet at 10:10. I see it is 10:05 & the fireworks werent done yet, but I didn't want to be late and him take off. so I rush over to where & bus was parked I got there at 10:09 missing some of the fireworks in order to arrive at the bus on time. He tells us 10:10 yet we didn't even leave until after 10:20 because some people decided to not show up on time. so it would have been nice giving us a time after the fireworks and enough time to walk back to see the whole show. ",
        "I felt off when I got to the bus he said \"oh give me a review now so you don't forget\" yet our tour wasn't done yet as we still had to get back to Toronto. Then on our way back he tells us \"oh the tours over now\" & got no info. Now he offers the wifi in order to do the review. While waiting I had seen reviews about certain guides with this company begging for tips after they got dropped off & that's when I noticed he had a paper saying \"please tip 15-20% of the price you paid for our service\" there were reviews of people saying they would stand infront of you while trying to get off the bus, and trying to intimidate you or beg you for the tips. one of these reviews mentioned a guide who was referring to the falls as the \"stupid falls\" so I was like oh great this is him and this is last thing I need is to be hounded to give a tip. ",
        "I had watched what he was doing while dropping people off in downtown toronto. He would get off the bus. Hold out his hand to help the guest down but was standing infront of them blocking them off and asking for a tip. He would continue trying to beg them until they gave in. Yes he did give us some information, but for any of the stops and even at niagara he didn't stay with us at all other than on the bus & to be late picking up after being told to be 15 minutes early. Just didn't feel like his service was great. Also I am against people begging for tips. If your service is good people will tip. You should not need to rely on begging guests for the tips. also the booking said tips were optional. ",
        "I came up with a plan to avoid this, and when he held his hand out I did a quick jump to his side so I could get infront of him and create some space so he couldn't box me in & I said thank you and hurried off. He then called out to me and said \"no tip?\" and I told him \"sorry I don't have any cash on me\". I feel like if I didn't see these reviews I would have been one of them  trapped & I really wasn't carrying any $ on me so i was glad I prepared for getting out of that situation. ",
        "I chose not to tip as well after the fact I seen the pricing for the hornblower it was only like 30$ (approx). I paid 200$ with tax, and I assumed that the stops we made along the way for the smallest chappal, flower clock and whirlpool were all paid activitys. I seen you could pay $ if you wanted to be on the boat during the light show, & i would have paid extra for this & wish I had the option. he was no where in sight to ask if we could chose to pay for this and still be able to make the bus, so i had to miss this. He offered a helicopter ride that wasnt even operating bc of the weather, so i dont get why he wouldnt offer this. I understand some of that $ would go to fuel, and some to pay for the wages, but for what I had gotten I could have done that all myself on my own if I was more comfortable driving in bigger cities. So he took the downtown people first, & this is when I noticed him honking his horn a lot. I thought that was quite unnecessary  He atold me \"oh your hotels too far I'll take you to the airport\" it was already about midnight and I'm thinking great, we won't get there till 1230 am, and I still have to call my shuttle which could take an extra 40 mins and another 12 minute drive so I'd be back closer to 130 am. In the tour info it showed this tour was 8-9 hours. I booked the 1 pm tour so the tour should have been finished by 9 pm then & us dropped off at the hotel. that's an extra 3.5 hours I wasn't expecting to arrive back that late when I had to be up at 6 am.",
        "Seeing the falls though was incredible, the boat tour and light show was amazing. I'm happy I went with my instincts and chose to go down lower because I felt like it was a better view.",
        "I just don't appreciate being told to arrive early, yet you can not do the same when I already had to go out of my way to get to a spot to meet after thinking for months I'd be picked up at the hotel. I also don't appreciate people begging for tips. That makes me 100% not want to."

        "The trip started off terrible. The driver showed up 45 minutes late, in a bus that had the check engine light on, the door didn’t close all the way, and stalled in the middle of the road. We had to stop to switch out buses at the airport. He then was on the phone with someone arguing about having two empty seats on his bus. So we had to make another stop to pick up more people. So we didn’t even get out to Niagara until 530pm. The whole trip was rushed, we didn’t get any time at all to enjoy the viewpoints or scenery. We were instructed to get off the bus, take a photo, and get back on. We finally get out there to get on our boat, and he had us literally running through the streets to get to the boat tour. No time to enjoy anything. The itinerary says they are skip the line entries- they were not. The boat trip itself was pretty cool. But again, we were rushed from the boat tour to dinner, because he told us the food was closed at 9pm. So again, no time to enjoy the falls. The dinner was really good, great selection and good food, however, we did not get to pick our own table, we had to sit at the same table as the whole bus, and we definitely did not have a view of the falls from our table. The itinerary also said we got free time to explore Niagara, we had none of that. It was super disappointing, especially since we paid so much for the experience. We really didn’t get to experience much of what was listed in the description. ",
        "He told us many times that traffic was always this bad and that we picked the worst time of the year to do this activity. If this is normal traffic, why did he not plan accordingly to pick us up on time? Or the company plan the trip pickup time for an earlier time to make up for time spent in traffic? Or even offer a discounted rate for the busier time of the year? ",
        "I wouldn’t recommend this company at all. So so unorganized."

        "This tour has a lot of potential but did not live up to expectations and other reviews. First of all, we were not picked up at our hotel. After choosing our hotel on the list of pick up locations, we were informed the day before to take the airport shuttle back to terminal 3-Sheraton for pick up. I picked this specific tour because it picked up at our hotel. Very disappointing start. After our group of 6 were picked up, we then drove 25-30 min and picked up a family at another hotel, who were 30 min late and we waited on them which ran our tour behind schedule. Such a rude family with lack of concern for anyone else on the tour. They continued to be late for returning from the boat, late for lunch, late finishing lunch and allowing their children to ruin the 1.5-2 hour bus ride both ways. Nothing was addressed by our guide, Johnny, in fact he praised them for their great parenting, just trying to get a tip. Our whole tour felt rushed. We  had no free time at the falls, only quick picture stops, no free time at Niagara on the lake, no shops open b/c we drove through b/f they open. Maple syrup tasting was fun and the boat ride was definitely the highlight. The lunch was horrible. Bad food, long lines at the buffet, lots of empty buffet bowels and rude servers. The view was nice, but that is it. I originally did not book lunch b/c I thought it was expensive, but felt pressured on the tour. Just think it was easier for the tour guide b/c he did not plan to get us the free time at the falls as advertised. For almost $200 per person, this tour was not worth it. ",

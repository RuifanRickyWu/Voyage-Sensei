We learned so much about what goes into making gin, fun facts about gin, their unique 64 time distilling process and then got to craft our own gin to our own tastes. We also really enjoyed the food we ordered. Looking forward to enjoying our gin at home - the Gin-tastic x 64 Stripper and the Gin Stripper, and coming back for more experiences at Spirit of York!"

Our guide Steve did an excellent job of mixing history of the industry from a local perspective, technical bits about distilling, and fun facts. I’ve been on quite a few brewery and vineyard tours, and this was a high quality tour while being accessible to folks who aren’t knowledgeable about the process. We all appreciated his approach to tastings, where he gave some background on the spirits but let us talk about what we tasted rather than “give away” the tasting notes. I appreciated this, as it sparked good group conversation. ",

We had to flag someone down and pretty much had to go get our food when we saw it appear at the bar.  Lots of staff cleaning glasses, standing behind the bar, on their phones, and not making eye contact with customers. No one approaching tables. The host kept seating people but never made eye contact again. No way to get a second drink. Probably could have left without paying but we did go to the bar to pay. Didn’t leave a tip since no one served us. Pretty uncomfortable atmosphere. So weird!"

What a great decision that was. The spirits (especially the gin, which is my go-to) were exceptional, and it was cool to hear about the distilling process and see the actual process occurring around you in the tasting room. My only regrets are that I didn’t schedule a tour, and that I didn’t have room in my suitcase to take a bottle or three back. Will definitely return next time I’m in Toronto. "

  "description": "The Kindred Spirits Orchestra (KSO) has been performing to a great acclaim, sold-out audiences, and standing ovations at the Flato Markham Theatre and at the Richmond Hill Centre for the Performing Arts, as well as at the CBC Glenn Gould Studio in Toronto. Led by the charismatic Maestro Kristian Alexander, the KSO is enjoying growing popularity among York Region's residents and continues to attract avid audiences across the Greater Toronto Area. In 2013, 2015 and 2019, the KSO was presented Awards from the Government of Canada for the \"extraordinary work of the Kindred Spirits Orchestra promoting Canadian music and Canadian composers in the community as well as for the orchestra’s community outreach and educational programs”. Between 2016 and 2019, the Government of Ontario awarded 21 members of the KSO for their contribution to the development of arts and culture in the community.",

He is an excellent conductor to lead his professional KSO musical group, I’m looking forward to see the concert on Oct 17 2020 by KSO : Beethoven Fifth Symphony, Erik Kreem’s Waltz and a world première of a Violin concerto by Werner Chan.   It would be spirit inspiration during the pandemic this year."

A friend invited me to Handel's Messiah, and I was a bit surprised by the size of the orchestra, and how tight the performance was. The 4 soloists were just as good as anything else I've heard in the genre, as was the choir. The woman who introduced the orchestra and the conductor also had a little preamble with facts and trivia about the work, which was interesting, and lasted just long enough. The venue was also comfortable. I highly recommend KSO to local Marhkamites looking to add some culture to their entertainment roster, Torontonians willing to brave the trip, tourists, everyone!"

They were capably led by their master conductor Kristian Alexander, who knew exactly how to showcase the hidden gems of his orchestra to enhance the stellar sound of each soloist. I was also very impressed by the high calibre of the performers, and would highly recommend to anyone who has an appreciation of classical music to experience the wondrous music of the KSO. It'll be a pleasurable night out for one and all."

All very worthy performances. ",

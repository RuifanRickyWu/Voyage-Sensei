        "I went 30 mins before show time and the seating area was mostly filled up so I sat at the top last row. However, the seating inclines downward so you have a great view from the top, and I liked being at the top because nobody was sitting behind me and I didn't have to worry about blocking other people's views. I brought a blanket to sit on, and some cookies to eat. Also remember to bring bug spray because the sun sets during the show and the mosquitoes come out. Some sort of cushioning like a blanket or pillow is necessary because the seating area are rocks and you won't be comfortable without something to sit on. The price is pay-as-much-as-you-can but they really push and recommend to pay $20. I gave $10 because before hand I went out for dinner so I didn't want to pay so much. The show and actors did a great job, and this is a great outing to do."

We also cycled on cycle share bikes - there’s a docking point right next for the amphitheater and it’s a nice ride along the lake from downtown Toronto (apart from the hill at the end!)."

        "Went to High Park for the production of “Romeo and Juliet”.  One friend went at 6:00 (at opening) to stake out a prime spot.  She brought blow up single sized mattresses to place on the ledge seating then a thin blanket to go on top.  That made for fairly comfortable seating. Bring a pillow or rolled up blanket or scarf to lean on otherwise you will lean on very hard cold rock!  The rest of the gals showed up between 6:30 and 7:30.  Shoe starts at 8:00.  We all brought picnic snacks to munch on.  The place filled up fast.  The volunteers will try to pack you but resist because you need some space to move around or shift your body.  Beware if you are tall as there isn’t much room for legs. It was lots of fun.   The play itself was very entertaining!  It took a while to get into but eventually it got good.   We picked an incredible bug free cool night.   People are all very friendly and courteous.  They ask for the donation before you see the play and recommend $20 but you can give as much or as little as you want.  One friend forgot her wallet and didn’t pay at all and there was no problem. "

        "The theatre that is produced here in the summer is amazing.  The seating in the amphitheare is very uncomfortable - bring extra padding to sit on, bug spray depending on when you go, and don't get packed in to close - make enough space for yourself that you can stretch out your legs without kicking the people sitting in front of you (say 6\" at least on either side of your butt)."

        "This is a great thing to do on a weeknight. If you want good seating in the ledge stadium seating be sure to come early. Gates open at 6pm. However if you aren't too fussed, we got there by 7:30 and had a blanket to sit on the grassy hill beside the chair seating in the upper section. You can buy concession food or bring your own food. We are at the Mexican place across from High Park. Great performance. Suggested donation is $20 per person but you can pay what you can. "

Although there was a van selling snacks and hot drinks,  I did bring my own picnic for dinner and it was worth it to ensure I kept a good spot. I did, however,  forget to bring a blanket or towel to sit on and it did get a little uncomfortable after a while, to sit on the grass.  "

We encourage others to make a donation because those productions are amazing and I doubt the actors get payed what they deserve. "

        "This is a marvellous way to spend a summer evening with a group of friends or family. The performances are presented in a compact 90-110 minutes with no intermission. That makes them a great introduction for people exploring the particular Shakespeare work for the first time. Yes, they're abridged but they move along at a good pace and include all the essentials.",
        "We generally wait for the season to get started and check out the reviews before we decide what to see but, generally speaking, the performances are highly regarded and most get very positive reviews. The company does an especially good job incorporating the outdoor environment.",
        "Leave the car home. Parking is tight. Take the Bloor-Danforth subway line to High Park Station, exit via High Park Ave. and cross Bloor St. W. to the park entrance. It's a 10-minute (900 m) walk along Colborne Lodge Dr. to the Amphitheatre.",
        "Pack a picnic lunch and one blanket for every 2-3 people in your party. Aim to arrive at about 5:30 pm and you should find yourself quite close to the front of the line. Gates open at 6:00 pm; performance begins at 8:00 pm. Admission is pay-what-you-can with a recommended donation. This year it was $20 per adult with no expectation at all from children. That means you can treat a large group for the price of a single ticket to some of the other shows in town. It really is a bargain. Bring cash. They accept electronic payment but the cash line moves much more quickly.",
        "Once through the gates, make your way down to the front of the amphitheatre and set out your blankets on the ground, right in the centre, up against the concrete wall. Sitting here, you can lean against the wall and stretch your legs out on the blanket and you're close enough to the action to feel part of it. The ushers will position two more rows of patrons between you and the stage but they won't have anything to lean against. The slope on the ground is quite steep so you'll have no problems seeing over their heads.",
        "Now you can enjoy your picnic in the park while you wait for the performance to begin. On selected nights, you can join a free backstage tour at 6:15. This is well worth your time and offers a peek into the accommodations required to present a show in the great outdoors rather than inside a traditional theatre."

        "Decided to see Hamlet while visiting Toronto for a few days, after seeing that we could reach it by streetcar. Thoroughly enjoyed the play, it was a great production! Wish we had brought insect repellent and cushions-the mosquitos came out about 20 minutes before the end of the show. We saw that food was available there, since we weren't driving, thought that would be difficult. Food and drinks were pricey($3.75 for water), so we stuck with snacks we had brought. Getting there by streetcar from hotel took about an hour and 15 minutes, then a 20 minute hike-uphill to reach the amphitheater in the center of the park. It was a bit dark walking back out through some sections of the park-but at least it was mostly downhill! There were 3-4 other people also walking so we weren't completely alone. It was an adventure for us, we enjoyed it -but don't want anyone to have the impression that it was an easy way to get there!"

Furthermore, the outdoor theater is in it's natural state which reminds me of Italy and other European countries live performances. There is a small fast food area where you can buy food and  rent out blanket, and back rest. Overall, an enjoying evening and experience. Bravo to the cast!! Gina "

The seating is on the grass on a hill terraced with concrete strips (think railroad ties), which provides both a comfortable ground seat and back support.  There is simple food available, and you can rent a blanket for the evening for next to no cost.  Most people bring their own food - anything from sandwiches to fancy cheeses and meats.  I was pleased to find that the audience behaves like an audience, in contrast to my home area outdoor events where everybody talks over the program.",

It's staged in a lovely grove of trees with a well-constructed permanent stage and a multi-tiered amphitheater carved into the hillside opposite. Acoustics & lighting are excellent and there's not a bad seat in the \"house\".",
        "Every year, the schedule has a comedy and tragedy on alternate days.The admission is \"Pay What You Can\" with a recommended donation of $20. Ive seen people pay much less with no problem whatsoever at the gate. ",
        "These Shakespeare plays in an awesome outdoor venue performed by talented professional actors would cost $100 a seat in a comparable downtown theatre. Shakespeare in High Park alone is worth a trip to Toronto."

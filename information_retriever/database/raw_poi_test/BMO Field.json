The seats on the sideline are well covered.  It rained non stop for the entire match, but everyone in my group was completely dry throughout.  The concessions and bathroom were easily accessible and clean.  My beer was much cheaper than I'm used to in the USA.  Thanks BMO Field for a 5 star Soccer viewing experience!"

        "Getting a “free” ticket for a seat related to my Atlanta United FC season tickets, did not allow me to choose the seat.  Consequently I was on the last row (highest) on the second level.  It was a very long walk up a lot of steps.  Not for the faint hearted.  The view of the field was good, but related to the position I was in, it was difficult to see the big screen to see close ups of the action.  I would not pay for that seat for a future match.  The atmosphere was very good however, food choices were fair, but expensive - although all stadium food is expensive related to what I am used to in my home stadium in Atlanta.  Service was quick, lines not too long at all.  Unusual way to enter the stadium, that even after going through security was still behind a closed gate for a while.  Location is absolutely perfect.  Beautiful view right on the water’s front.  Great park and walking area just across from the stadium if you have spare time when going to an event."

        "I went to my first MSL game at BMO field with three friends, including a fanatic soccer fan visiting from Russia.  I had heard very good things about the atmosphere at BMO field, and I wanted to show off to my friend North America’s best soccer team.  We drove down from Ottawa and got four seats in the supporters section from my cousin who has had season tickets from the beginning.  We got to the game 1/2 hour before the start, but two of the tickets wouldn’t scan and we were told to go to the box office.  We waited there for 45 minutes, and then were told two of the seats had already entered so were null and void.  It seemed dozens of others were also having the same problem.  My cousin attested they were his personal tickets and had not been resold or sent to anybody else.  He then texted his buddies in the stadium who replied that all the seats were still empty.  Nevertheless, they would not let us in, so we had to buy two more seats (in another section from the originals).  When we finally scanned in, we found people sitting in our just purchased seats who had the same seat numbers.  We showed an usher our tickets who said he didn’t know what happened but we couldn’t sit there.   We then tried to go to our original seats, but by this time someone was sitting in them who claimed they belonged to “his boys,” although he acknowledged that he did not have a ticket for the seats.  When I went to show him my etickets, my phone battery died so I no longer had proof of having any seats at all (the box office had taken our paper tickets). Another usher came and asked to see our tickets which I could no longer show, and then he wanted to escort us out of the building because we had no tickets. My friend then called my cousin who convinced the usher that we were there legit.  We were then seated in random seats (two and two) only to have another person without a ticket for the seats show up and claim the new seats belonged to his friend.  Eventually we found another two empty seats in the back row with 4 minutes left in the first half.  Whole thing was a total nightmare, although my Russian friend found the whole thing quite funny (and more entertaining than the actual game which TFC won 3-1."

The stadium is great and had good facilities another reviewer said these were poor but god help him if he went to an Everton FC game as that really would be an eye opener! We had fantastic seats with no obstructed views again unlike watching Everton but it was a great experience to see a game and be able to drink in the stands which sadly we are unable to do back home they even had a beer guy so you could buy while the match was going on the only disappointment was that TFC didnt win but the Mexican fans were friendly and it was great there was no segregation like in England. My sister in law bought a TFC shirt to go the match in but me and my brother could not bring ourselves to wear a red shirt due you our rivals on Merseyside playing in them! All in all it was a great night and we will all root for TFC now in the future and hopefully be back to see an MLS match in a full stadium."

These tickets are for a shockingly poor view that you have to be over 6ft to have a chance to see the game at all but totally unsuitable for children so we ended up trying to find a point that we could all see the game to no avail so we ended up going to the other end of the stadium so we could watch it on the big screen-the first time we have spent 300 bucks to watch a game on the television.

There can be so many people using it that it can be dangerous for the crush. Best to wait for the traffic to thin out."

I’ve had numerous facials and laser removal sessions with Ana and I couldn’t be happier with the service, expertise and results. I’ve tried out several other estheticians and salons in the past but I’m glad to have finally found one I can trust - will be a customer of Ana’s at this studio for life! Highly recommend to anyone who is looking for honest advice and friendly service."

She informed me about her product line, but never put pressure on me to purchase. This was really important to me as I have been to other spas where pressure is applied to buy a lot of products. The whole experience was excellent. I will be back in a few weeks for more treatments and to buy some products.",

        "Over the past three months I was extremely stressed and it started to show on my face. I had developed acne, and the scarring was so extreme that I was embarrassed to go out and no amount of makeup looked good to cover the scars. I went to the Beauty Studio for a solution and the esthetician there Nataliya Patriki was so amazing and she introduced me to some amazing Dermalogica products. I used the Medibac collection which is for acne prone skin. I used the Clearing wash in the morning and the Microfoliant rice enzyme scrub which was extremely gentle for the skin. I followed that my applying clearing mattifier which was so gentle and applied so smoothly on my face and prevented breakouts during the day. I then applied Active moist to retain the moisture in my skin, and it was oil free which I loved. Following that I applied the Sun screen to protect my skin. At night I using the clearing wash, then the Microfoliant, and followed it by the gentle cream exfoliant which penetrated to the deeper layers of my skin, then I used a sebum clearing clay masque to pull the oil out of my skin. To prevent breakouts at night I used cleaning gel, and followed it by Active moist to lock in moisture. This routine really helped me to control my acne.",
        " ",
        "Now the issue of scarring was  really lowering my self esteem so Nataliya recommended a few sessions of photo facial which uses lazer beam to penetrate to the deeper layers of the skin and regenerate new cells. On my first session, my pigmented skin became darker, and over a couple of days it crusted and the dead skin fell off. I noticed the same pattern and lighter and brighter skin formed underneath the pigmented skin. I was extremely trilled with the results I have more even luminant skin. Although its not 100% My skin has dramatically changed for the better over the last few weeks, and Nataliya was so amazing and patient. I really recommend her salon The Beauty Studio for anyone who has the same concerns, you will feel comfortable and at home."

After analyzing my skin, she reassured me that I didn't need the birth control pill to achieve flawless and breakout-free skin.  I entrusted her fully with my skin and started receiving facials from her as well as following her skin regimen advice at home.  My skin on my wedding day was perfect! Even before my wedding day, friends and family started commenting on how beautiful my skin looked. I also had my eyelashes done with Nataliya and they looked stunning and very natural. I was blessed with getting pregnant with my daughter soon after my wedding.  If it wasn't for Nataliya giving me a medication-free solution for my skin, I might have still be trying to get pregnant till this day! Thank you Nataliya for the beautiful skin and my daughter!"

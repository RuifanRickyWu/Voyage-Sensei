You look through the windows and the view is projected onto the walls surrounding the plane. Graphics probably could be a bit sharper or more detailed but they were quite good and responded as expected. I flew it into, among other places, Wiarton. There is a very large selection of airports to fly into. I am familiar with Wiarton airport from having flown my Cessna 172 there so I could judge the simulation and it is good. The one thing it does not have is motion of the plane but that is only found on the multi million $ simulators. The person who acted as our instructor was very good."

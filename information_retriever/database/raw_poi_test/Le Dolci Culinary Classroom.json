There are so many options out there for cooking and a lot of the smaller classes were too expensive, were part of larger groups, or pre-recorded classes.",
        "I asked my colleague if they happened to have put on any cooking class events before, and he said no but his sister had done a few baking classes recently. So I reached out to Le Dolci Bakery and they went through a few options for us and we decided to do their apple pie class.",
        "The team absolutely loved it. They were able to interact with the chef while baking and still able to chit chat and laugh along with each other. I have a team of over achievers over here and they were able to create some masterpieces (pics included). Some baked theirs right after and others froze them for future eats. ",

        "Recently my daughter and I attended a Cake decorating class at Le Dolci and had a blast! All the hard work is done for you - when you arrive, you have a table set up with cakes baked and ready for assembly and a tub of icing, turntable, spreading tools and aprons (although you can bring your own if you have one). Attendees are required to wear masks and tables are generously spaced, so the environment is very safe. They also offer virtual classes and kits that you can order and there are classes for a variety of types of baking and suitable for a variety of skill levels. Our instructor Zoe was friendly and helpful - she demonstrated how to assemble the cake and decorate it and was available for questions and assistance. She coloured the icing for us and piping bags and tips were provided as well as sprinkles and dragees so that we could decorate to our hearts' content. We each left with a beautiful and delicious cake (if you've ever sampled one of Le Dolci's cakes or cupcakes, they are superb! ) Lots of fun and suitable for a novice baker! We plan to return for a future class - perhaps something more challenging like macarons or bread!"

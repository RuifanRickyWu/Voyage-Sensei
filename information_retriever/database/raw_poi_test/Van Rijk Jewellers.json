        "Vast selection of high valued products. Secure facility. Polite. Knowledgeable. Based upon other reviews, buying from their existing supply may be a good option.  I was not there to buy so cannot personally comment on this part of their offering.",
        "The possible selling option (asking them to buy what I had) was not what I had anticipated.",
        "I share my experience with you to help others have a more informed approach.",
        "Alec explained to me that the “product” (the item as it was presented, based upon my selection of pieces) was not what was being valued.",
        "Stones (diamonds, emeralds, topaz, sapphires, etc.) would be removed from the setting (nominal value, if anything) and then the gold melted down to be reused.  Product settings, approximately 10-15 years old, were advised to be outdated.  Some were bulk shopping and therefore not valued as named items may have been.",
        "The pieces were inspected – including the stones - then everything was gathered up and weighed together by type of metal.  The offer received was less than 10% of the current estimated retail value. While I had not expected anything close to retail (even stores cannot always sell for full 'retail'), I was significantly surprised by the percentage offered.  I learned a lot about “breakup value” which is something one does not learn when initially buying jewellery.",
        "From a selling perspective – I am left with the understanding that unless heirloom or high-end, the product may be worth only a fraction of what one imagines.  I am in no way an expert in this field but am grateful for the lesson.",
        "For now, I will hold onto my pieces and wear them with love and affection as Alec suggested."

        "Overall I felt that VRJ did change my perspective on the service they can give.  I felt I got a fair negotiation that leaned towards the watch I was purchasing as the winner.  The watch I purchased was in great shape and complete with box and papers. I foresee going back in just about every time I am in Toronto but will always be looking at watches which are priced fairly (given their inventory, I think you can always find one if you do your homework and diligence).",
        "I have gone from giving them 1 star based on how I felt treated upon first contact, to 3 given how Alec went out of his way to remediate, to 5 given how happy I am with my current purchase."

I had seen a number of businesses and individuals offering to purchase old gold, jewelry and watches in the Toronto newspapers.  We now have a Toronto Classical radio station rebroadcasting from Collingwood and I had heard Alex Van Rijk advertising regularly.  So I decided to see what he would say about my Rolex. I was somewhat leery when I visited him.  I didn’t know what to expect and wondered if he would try to “low ball” with comments about poor markets, poor demand, etc.  When we sat down ( I had called ahead and made an appointment), he asked about the history of the watch.  He then set to work getting the serial number, and researching the watch, checking it’s condition, etc.  I was very impressed and very pleased with how he conducted his business and how he arrived at what ",
        "I considered was a very fair offer for my time piece.  He offered me 3 options for purchasing it, told me what he would sell it for and how much he would profit from the sale.  I found him to be very open and honest and professional.  I highly recommend him."

        "July 2019 I attended at Van Rijk to get 4 items appraised. I met with the owner Alec Van Rijk. During the course of appraising these items, Mr. Van Rijk broke two earrings, ruining one pair entirely. He broke them by rubbing them roughly against a hard slate object in an attempt to determine the quality of the gold. Mr. Van Rijk acknowledged what he had done and offered another pair of earring as a replacement. Given I was at his establishment in order to obtain a valuation of the earrings he had ruined, I had no ability to assess the reasonableness of his replacement offer.  To say I was shocked and angry was an understatement.  Stay away!!!  I have also filed a claim with the Better Business Bureau (#1397910)."

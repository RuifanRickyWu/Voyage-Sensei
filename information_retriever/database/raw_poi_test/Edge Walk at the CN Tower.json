  "description": "EdgeWalk is the \"World's Highest External Walk on a Building\" (Guinness World Record), a full circle hands-free walk on a 5 ft (1.5 m) wide ledge encircling the top of the Tower's main pod. Visitors walk in groups of six, while attached to an overhead safety rail via a trolley and harness system. Trained EdgeWalk guides encourage participants to push their personal limits, allowing them to lean back over Toronto with nothing but air and breathtaking views of Lake Ontario beneath them. Designed with the highest international safety and security standards in mind, EdgeWalk runs 1.5 hours, with the outdoor walk lasting approximately 30 minutes. Tickets include a keepsake video, photos and certificate of achievement. Participants also receive a CN Tower re-admission General Admission ticket + SkyPod (includes access to LookOut, Glass Floor/outdoor SkyTerrace, SkyPod Levels). EdgeWalk operates seasonally from spring to late fall, 7 days a week, and hours of operation fluctuate depending on daylight.",

You walk around the CN Tower 400m above the ground, you feel so free, I admit I was a bit nervous before, but as soon as you're up there, you just feel so good and relax!! We even had the chance to watch a few minutes of the Blue Jays game which was playing down there!! ü§©ü§©ü§© That was awesome!!!!"

        "I was given the gift of the CN Tower Edge Walk to celebrate a milestone birthday. I had wanted to do it ever since I saw Jann Arden and Rick Mercer do it on his show 12 years ago. It delivered on all I expected it to be. I had a blast. It was made extra special by having family members share the experience with me. All the staff were excellent and I felt totally safe. It was absolutely perfect weather so the view was spectacular. It was interesting looking down at the Toronto Blue Jays playing baseball in the dome. Rebecca (aka Domino) did a superb job of guiding us through all the moves on our walk. She was informative and funny. It‚Äôs wonderful having photos and a video of the experience. I would go again in a heartbeat!! Highly recommended."

        "Did the vm tower edge walk at night and it was simply amazing. First off we felt like stars as we walked in the door and they started clapping for us like we were astronauts-it was a nice touch. They put safety as a very high priority and our guide was fabulous! ",
        "It‚Äôs definitely something to try if you ever come to Toronto.  I highly recommend."

        "We went as a couple along with a friend, and due to traffic and circumstances we needed as much buffer time as possible, right up until the very last moment they would allow us to enter and begin. The Edgewalk team was accommodating and understanding, and we got in just in time, so we thank them profusely for how they were right off the bat-- before we'd even begun! Then as we began to suit up and get going, it became obvious how the experience and knowledge they had was giving us all the comfort and encouragement needed for any fears or jitters. Our guide was a superb young lady who helped make the time up there so much fun, often helping us forget our fears (at least for a few moments at time!).",
        "We felt as safe as it can get; their process is rigorous, the suits, harnesses, and cables system is no joke. You will be tested by multiple team members, and they go the extra mile to ensure everyone is made to feel fully confident in every aspect before even entering the elevator to go up.",
        "Also, we'd like to mention that you receive a video of your group's Edgewalk, as well as a couple photos, and you can purchase the full pictures which are very reasonably priced. You'd expect to be gouged, but this is not the case, so that topped off the whole thing.",
        "100% recommended for anyone who is interested in one of the most unique experiences you can have, creating a memory to last a lifetime!"

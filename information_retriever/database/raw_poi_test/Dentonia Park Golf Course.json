  "description": "Situated astride Lake Ontario, Scarborough is a district heavily influenced by immigration. With a number of low-rent shopping and dining options making it a highly affordable part of town, and boasting one of Toronto's largest shopping malls, the otherwise green suburban neighborhood is a good place to go for bargains and discounts. It also draws in photographers. The spires, archways, and cavernous rooms of the BAPS Shri Swaminarayan Mandir Palace are filled with breathtaking art, architecture, and detailed reliefs – it’s like entering a different world, The ruins of columns and installation art at the Guild Inn makes a free-for-all exploration site, while the big-name draw for young photographers is the menagerie at the Toronto Zoo. While many visitors shirk Scarborough as too suburban, its houses are some of Toronto's most mystical and haunting architectural beauties. And for adventure lovers, it has river-rafting and some unique hiking trails.",

We played for a $22 twilight rate in the middle of the day and you can take the subway there if you want. All Par 3s, most holes are in the 100 yard range, with a couple at 120-150."

        "My daughter and I together with her fiancée and his brother played another twilight 18 here.  For a public pay and play golf course it is pretty well maintained and has several great holes.  The greens are small and the average hole just over 100 yds with one or two slightly longer requiring a 7 iron from the tee.   We had no delays and equally, we didn't cause any hold-ups either.  There are some pretty steep climbs to greens or tees and as such I couldn't recommend this if you're struggling to walk through either age or illness.  18 hole took us slightly over two and a half hours to complete and was a very pleasant evening."

        "My daughter and I spent a few hours here playing 18 in the twilight hours for $20.  She's had a few lessons here and so felt more comfortable playing.  It can be a tight little course with small, shallow greens.  The 11th is certainly a daunting shot from the elevated tee to a postage stamp sized green nearly 200yds away.  Most holes are a PW drive.  The greens were quite slow and some of the tees are from mats but otherwise a good little course.  The stream is a bit pungent on a warm summers night."

Dentonia is the queen of par 3 courses primarily because it does not cut corners and throw in some giveaway holes. The whole course is well designed and totally unexpected given that it is just outside a subway stop."

        "This 18 holer is a beaut! If you can hit a high backspinner no more than 150 yards then this course is for you. Its more of a short game putting test than a full examination of ones full repertoire of shots on say a Par 72 6000+yard course.  The course and greens are excellent year round. The clubhouse is clean. The Pro his name is Brian is friendly. They hav 3 net-cages for warming up, very well maintained. There is a superb putting green chipping area. My only gripe is that on about 3 holes the tee boxes are astro turf."

My wife really enjoyed the experience and might just make a golfer out of her yet! The course was pretty much how I remember it growing up. The conditions were decent for a par 3 and the staff were friendly and helpful. One thing of note is that it is very hilly and they do not allow power carts out on it."

Played 4 times last week, went out as a single at 7am, and pretty much had the course to myself in front of me. Beautifully well kept course, for a city course. Played a Sat afternoon this month with my g/f and finished in about 3 hours. And yes, they have a beer cart. :)"

        "This quaint little par three won’t wow anyone with its beauty or finesse but if you’re itching to play a little golf before moving on with your day – fit in a quick 18 here in less than 3 hours give or take depending on your company! More accomplished golfers need their wedge and putter only, while a 9 and 7 iron might prove handy for others. The course visibly needs some TLC - teeing off on turf at several holes isn’t appealing for golfers and pin location is curious on some rather large greens. Overbooking does bring upon waiting times so you have to be somewhat assertive with people in front of you as marshals are seemingly there for a joy ride only."

        "Dentonia Park Golf Course is a small, hilly par 3 course on the eastern edge of the city of Toronto. Unfortunately, it has tried recently to rebrand itself as a destination for more serious golfers, which I think is a mistake. ",
        "The course, built into the Don Valley ravine, is quite pretty and offers some interesting playing challenges such as sand traps, water hazards and plenty of trees. With its relatively unintimidating length, it would be an excellent setting for less sophisticated players: beginners, for example, or families, or people who aren't competitive golfers but still enjoy the game. There is a need for such courses! ",
        "Dentonia, however, has recently become more stringent about rules intended to honour the traditions of the game, including respectful conduct and suitable attire. No arguments there, but Dentonia's interpretation and their enforcement of these rules seem entirely unreasonable and inconsistent. An acquaintance was told -- despite the fact that he was wearing an athletic, mock-neck shirt -- that he would have to buy a collared shirt from the pro shop if he was to be allowed to play (interestingly, during my game at Dentonia yesterday I saw more than one player in a t-shirt).",
        "My foursome's play was delayed more than once yesterday as the grounds crew went about their business, operating well outside the concept of \"respectful conduct\". We had to wait to tee off at the ninth hole while the crew scattered grass seed, and on the twelfth hole the mower actually drove around me as I attempted to take my second shot. The mower then followed us onto the thirteenth hole.",
        "Dentonia Park expects too much from its patrons given the quality of play it is able to deliver in return. In my opinion, Dentonia should be a bit more respectful of the players while not taking itself quite so seriously."

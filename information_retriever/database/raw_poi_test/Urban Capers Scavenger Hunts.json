There were 12 of us, but it would also be fun for couples or smaller/larger groups.  The event was very well organized and we found the clues to be just enough of a challenge to keep it interesting.  If you are an AGO member, call when purchasing your tickets because the price includes admission to the AGO.  There is a prize for the winning team which is pretty cool.  After the adventure is over, you can stay at the AGO if there were areas you still wanted to see.  Overall, a fabulous afternoon of fun!"

        "I had the very great pleasure of taking in this tour this past weekend for my birthday.  I booked a large party and initially, I failed to see the time of the tour until after I booked 12 tickets.  Well, when I realized my error and 6 guests could no longer come, they were quick to refund me for the people who couldn't come.  It was quick, they were kind and that experience alone had me looking forward to the actual event.  ",
        "It was well planned, well executed and very professional.  Prizes were handed out to the winning team and the team with the best name and afterwards we all got to enjoy drinks and an appy at a nearby bar.  I had 2 guests who dressed up in the era.  They were awesome.  My only suggestion is to include a little something for those who dress the part (literally).  HA!!",
        "We loved being able to actually go inside the buildings and learn a little about the history of the distillery.  Yes, the buildings are old and make a beautiful picture (we saw a couple getting their engagement photos done and 2 weddings).  Yes, it's a touristy spot with some pretty amazing sculptures (the 3 legged spider, the heart and the LOVE sign) and restaurants (Soma, El Catrin, Brick Street Bakery) but there is a story to tell.  I've been to the distillery a number of times and never knew I could venture inside and learn about it all.  This tour allowed me to do that.",
        "The organizer (Jodi I think) was lovely.  She filled us in that the company has really taken off in the last year and they hope to have more events like it in the future.  They are currently putting the finishing touches on the Curse of the Mummy caper which we can't wait to try.  All of my guests complimented me on my choice of activity and most of them agreed, they would be back for another tour.",
        "Responses to other reviews:  this is a new and developing company.  So, they may not have the money available to throw around on prizes.  If you're unhappy with the quality of prize, politely decline it.  I'm sure in the near future, they may no longer ask for their materials back to use on another group.  And even if they do, they are being environmental conscious.  What would you honestly do with the reading materials if you took them home?  Toss them away, right?!  ",

I understand that we may not be the smartest people on the planet but we moved through each clue easily with very little difficulty and we still ram out of time.

The variety in the types and difficulty levels of the clues meant everyone played a part in solving the murder mystery.

One note: If you want to spend time seeing the excellent museum exhibits, you should probably do so on a separate visit.

Groups were started at different locations within the ROM ( Royal Ontario Museum) so crowding around clues was avoided. Purpose of event is to discover clues on who murdered the museum curator. For those who enjoy murder mysteries and solving puzzles, this is it. Make sure you get there 15 minutes prior to start time so you can review the package.

No effort whatsoever from the 2 girls running the \"show\", and when we were done (its 2 hours, took 1:15 to complete) we ran into them and they gave us a heavy eye roll and told us to wait till it was the final time as they proceeded to walk into a bar.

One of the things we were worried about is that we may have to interact with lots of random people in order to solve the murder but it really is just you and your team working through clues using the museum to find the answers. We started off not really engaged in the game not knowing what to expect but once it started we were having an amazing time trying to find answers to clues.

        "Our group of friends tried out the Murder Mystery at the ROM to celebrate a friend's birthday recently and we had so much fun. The experience exceeded our expectations and it was a great way to enjoy the ROM. The creators have done a great job connecting the ROM's history and exhibits to the Murder Mystery clues and story. Plus you get an awesome gold magnifying glass if you win (which we did)!"

        "Went to ROM urban Capers event at the ROM and had fun trying to solve the murder mystery. Organizers were funny and engaging in preparing for the event as well as the recap. A great time to spend a few hours with fri nods and become awed at the cool artifacts at the ROM (your tix includes admission too!).   Will definitely like to try their other adventures. "

        "Did the Murder at the ROM and although I have been to this museum multiple times, I explored different parts and learned new things!  Questions were well-researched and we had an AMAZING time working out the various parts of the mystery.  Our team was 4 adults in our mid-20s and it was one of the best interactive activities we've done!  It was just intellectually stimulating enough and so much fun!",
        "The staff were also wonderful to work with. ",
        "Would highly recommend for others and I know our group will be back to do many more Urban Capers events!"

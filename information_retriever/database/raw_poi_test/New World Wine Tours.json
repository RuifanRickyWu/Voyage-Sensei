We hope to join them again when they can start to offer in person sessions."

My father called me right away after the wine tasting to tell me that he was so impressed with Mackenzie and how he was so knowledgable and charismatic. I echo his sentiments. I am so happy with our experience and so happy that my dad loved his father's day gift. Thank you Mackenzie!"

In addition to sampling some of the best pastry bites around town, we got an impromptu graffiti street tour and we even went off script when McKenzie went out of his way to ask questions in the field to local businesses and patrons whenever we wanted extra info on things around town.  On our last stop at a Portuguese bakery for tarts, McKenzie wrote us out a list of wineries to visit on our self-guided tour the next day, even drawing us a map and telling us of places for free parking.  Our guide is a world traveler who not only regaled us with great stories,but also answered any question we had of the area, the people, and the economy of Canada.  I highly recommend a private tour and we can’t wait to come back next year when pot is legal to take a Pot & Pastry Prommenade!"

A majestic place with breath taking views. We took a boat ride into the falls. A must do. Our journey continued to the Coyote vineyard, a lunch stop at Ravine vineyard where the food was fresh, local and delicious. On the way back to Toronto we visited 2 more vineyards, Stratus and Kew. The wines at all of the vineyards were of high quality and unique. We are so glad that we took this tour. If you are staying in Toronto don’t miss a chance to go to the falls and the Niagara-on-the-Lake region with this company."

The best tour came from the most commercialized vineyard but the best service came from the first vineyard we went to. Fred at the vineyard was welcoming,  informative, and very pleasant."

The tour was exactly what we needed: super fun, relaxing and memorable! The lunch spot was amazing - right on the lake and we got beautiful weather. All the wineries were really cool and we purchased some amazing wine! Truly a great day with an awesome tour guide! Definitely book this tour - I would highly recommend it!"

It's such a  unique experience and different from the typical wine tours. Mackenzie, our guide was fantastic. He was very accommodating, and he had great ideas to make our event more catered to us, and made the experience more special for us.  If you want to do something different with a big group, I highly recommend the Queen West Pastry Crawl!"

There were two of us in the car and we had the benefit of an in-depth tour of the area, avoiding the usual tourist traps and yet having the time to see everything that was worth seeing. We were not rushed and so were able to see the rural beauty and timelessness of the area. Our questions on wine (and food and architecture and travel) were all answered and Susu took us to places that she felt we would enjoy based on our conversations. I will never forget our last vineyard, Queenston Road sitting out in the late autumn sunshine, soaking in the wines, being allowed to savour the simple beauty of the place and enjoy the company of our hostess at the vineyard, Jodie. This sensitivity to our pace and reading us as clients was much appreciated and I felt it was more than just a couple of tourists being given a quick run down of the area. Thanks Susu and Mackenzie for organising. "

He was extremely knowledgeable about Toronto and the food scene.  Upon pick up, he asked us where we had been & what preferences we had so that he could cater the tour to meet our needs.  We hit 8 spots on this tour in total and were able to get see many of the areas we hadn’t been to in one afternoon.  Mackenzie made a point of showing us some of the city highlights and made a special stop at a mural of a squirrel b/c of a conversation my friends brought up on the tour.  I would hands down recommend this tour if you want to see and learn more about Toronto and of course experience the delicious food scene.  My only regret is that we didn’t get a photo of us with our great guide!"

Our 5-hour journey started in the Distillery district/area, which included many shops/restaurants - all palates could be pleased, and Mackenzie was adamant about pleasing the disparate palates/allergies/interests.

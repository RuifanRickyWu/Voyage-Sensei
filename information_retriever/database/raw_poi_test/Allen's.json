        "Extensive menu - from burgers, pizzas to lamp shanks and grilled red snapper. I had the latter - which was ok but overcooked and very small portion. Suspect that pizzas, and burgers and diner type food is the best type to chose. My father declared the lamb shank with champ delicious. We should have ordered extra vegetables. The restaurant was very busy as  concert was on at the popular music hall next door. Our waiter was polite but slightly brusque in his explanations - no doubt due to the crowd pouring in. Pleased we booked ahead."

        "But the worst part was the miserable waitress. Maybe a bad day but when you sit down late to the table and you ask if you can order a drink and you are told \"I've been trying to take a drink order for some time\" perhaps it's a bit snarky. ",
        "Our desserts were delivered incorrectly and one of my friends got a dessert that she thought was hers so she ate half of it. When the waitress came out with the correct dessert she basically asked her to give the half eaten dessert to the friend who should have been given it in the first place. Seriously?! Finally the agreed to simply give a new dessert to both girls but not without making a bit of a deal about it. I don't think our waitress cracked a smile all night. ",
        "With a lot of great restaurant choices on the Danforth I'm not sure if go back. "

        "While in Toronto, it is such shame to report that while we had an amazing meal and attentive server; however, the host was shockingly rude. She had an issue with my area code when calling me back after I left my number on their reservation call back system (\"oh great, now I have a 403 area code on my phone bill\") and when we arrived at the restaurant this same host appeared to size up our casual appearance and seated us right next to the drafty front door despite better seating being available. I was further disappointed to learn that our host was the owner's wife. My partner lives in the neighbourhood and frequents the restaurant regularly.  I will be recommending we find new restaurants to spend the $120-$200+ we usually spend there and encouraging our friends and family in the neighbourhood to do the same."

A lovely backyard patio and an extensive beer and wine list are just icing on the cake. "

        "The food was very good and was cooked \"homestyle\". The portions were quite large and they did an excellent job with the wine pairing. The service was friendly albeit a touch slow but only because they were really busy.  The place had a really nice ambiance and we will definitely be returning. "

        "My first trip to Allen's I was as interning for a photographer who took sympathy on me, a 6'3\" 140 pound art student (~1988). Just being in a restaurant or eating something other than grilled cheese or KD at that time was a big deal, let alone having one of Allen's now infamous burgers. The food, patio in the back, and atmosphere were things that at that point in my life were like something in a movie.",
        "I've come along since then and been back regularly over the years... playing bodhran on St Patrick's day (blackened potatoes, stout and wobbly Irish dancers) first date with my partner of 16 years (I was late and nearly blew it), on return after years away in Japan to find Dora's next door had opened up to make a good thing even better, and as a local pub near our first house (life before children!). We live in the West end now but go back a few times a year before a concert at the neighbouring Danforth Music Hall (tonight it's Billy Bragg!) ",
        "So I'm biased about Allen's. I can tell you about many occasions here – where I sat, what was said and what I ate. It’s the kind of place you remember.",

The service is prompt and what may seem like a curt attitude is just staff working very hard. Packed with locals and tourists alike, Allen’s has had a special buzz about it since it opened a quarter century ago.",

        "We have been coming here for years. The beer menu is peerless in this city. The food had always been good and no probs with the professional-grade service. There is live music some evenings and the owner makes an effort to create a NYC Irish pub vibe. We sat beside famed rocker Geddy Lee and his family one afternoon, as we ate. We stayed away from Allens for a period, due to the owner's stubborn attitude towards the then-new no-smoking laws. In our opinion, it was inexcusable for any eatery ownership anywhere to oppose such clear-headed thinking, because it wazzam (was and still is) disgusting to try and enjoy meals next to smokers. Thankfully, wiser heads prevailed and Allens, with its wonderful backyard patio trees, makes for a fine time. I am done. The end."

        "The food is decent, but not extraordinary, although it definitely positions itself as a pub that is closer to an old style steak restaurant than a pub/bar (If you want a younger/funkier feel... and a better menu, go a bit further east on the Danforth... same side of the street... and check out the new place \"Factory Girl\" which also has a good terrace).",
        "There's a good choice of brews, and a decent wine list... and, as I said in the heading, the burger is really quite wonderful... but be warned it is exactly that... a BURGER... you have to order separately and pay for... the lettuce and tomato, the cheese, the bacon, the onions... etc etc. It's fine, a little over the top since it actually adds up quite quickly (no fries either, they're extra too.. and not that good frankly)..",
        "The bottom line, an interesting experience... just not everyone's taste. Probably worth checking out if you want something a little 'older' and formal."

        "If you're planning on dining with your kids ~ don't take them to Allen's.  We went this past weekend because we were entertaining some folks from out of town, who enjoy drinking good scotch.  Upon arrival, we were rudely greeted by the host and he condescendingly informed us about their \"child policy\" ~ which is, “no kids allowed after 8 PM”.  He seemed agitated and made us feel rushed and unwelcome.  ",
        "Fortunately, the waiter was very kind and thoughtful.  Your food and drink menu was enticing and everything was cooked to perfection.  Sadly, we only half enjoyed it, as we sat in tension, gulped everything down, and checked our watches every 10 minutes.  When we were finished with our meals, we didn't feel comfortable ordering dessert or any of their famous scotch and left promptly at 8 sharp.  As we walked out the door, I was so bloody mad that I wished we had chosen to walk out after our arrival.  ",
        "Unfortunately, we will probably never return to Allen's, and we will share our experience with others - especially those with children.  We understand if they have to have \"a policy\" about children, and would have taken that into consideration if we had known ahead of time.  However, that does not excuse the rude and unwelcoming greeting we received upon entering their restaurant. ",

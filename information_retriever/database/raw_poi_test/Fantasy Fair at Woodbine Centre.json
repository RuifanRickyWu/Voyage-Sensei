You could plan birthday parties at a cheap expense. And the best part aboutthis place,  its COMPLETLY FREE!"

        " ",
        "At first glance on Google it has a 4+ rating and we thought it would be a good place to bring our four year old to kill some time. We made the mistake of showing our daughter the pictures of the attractions, because upon our arrival (and sadly after ordering two tickets via Groupon) there were barely any rides functioning. The rides that were functional were sometimes operated by employees who had to work two different rides simultaneously. All of the stores lining the paths of the park were closed and through the windows you could see they were mostly deserted, some with filled with garbage.",
        "The whole place seemed extremely forgotten and not clean. When I say not clean I don't mean a little dust here and there, that is normal/acceptable. I mean everything had a layer of what felt like grime all over it and I wanted to rinse myself off within 20 minutes of being there. The bathrooms are sadly in the same (if not worse) condition and no place to take a child.",
        "Safety also didn't seem to be as important as cleanliness. The playground for kids to climb in was ridden with duckt tape and zip ties, with the nets not being fully fastened in some spots. And while such playgrounds use zip ties in their design, you could tell some were put there to fix a tear. I was nervous going on this playground with my daughter, as it didn't feel safe. The arcade had a gate for locking up during closing and this was being propped up by a vending machine on wheels on one side and a broomstick on the other. ",
        "The employees seemed miserable and I would be too if I worked there. They seemed distant and not at all with their heads in the right state of mind to watch out for children's safety. Some even seemed strung out or under the influence of either alcohol or drugs.",
        "The mall where it's located is just as bizarre and depressing as the fair. Weird stores with junk, almost more of a flea market with closed stores all over. The patrons were also a very strange crowd, with people lingering and not giving us a safe vibe.",
        "All of this for a steep price of 48 Canadian Dollars with the groupon. We went on the three rides we could and left rather quick to sit in a hotel lobby for our time before our flight, because that was much more comfortable/clean/safe than Fantasy Fair. Don't bother going here unless you want to pay to see a mini-amusement park and mall in a failed state. I'd give it no stars if it was possible."

And they could most definitely use more benches and sitting areas for resting and for parents. Its also crazy they don't have Wi-Fi.

And then she print out single ticket over to me and she said to me , that she not supossed give to me cause i buy that for my elder son.but she give it to me this favour for me.after this  i though she is very kind person and im saying thanks to her.",

We went for the ice cream (stranger things 3) in 2019. My dad just stepped in to the washroom for a warm welcoming of dirt and cockroaches.  This made me almost puked because they scare me a lot, but another thing is we wouldn’t be able to get ice cream anyway! It was false advertising of something because it was just closed. One more thing is that the bathroom was in the food court. So I repeat do not go here. My dad even has a video."

My only negative comment was housekeeping, my husband and I ate and sat  at the subway, the housekeeper had their cart parked close to our table and it was just there the whole time we were there. Why couldn't they park their cart somewhere that's not accessible to the public, it was really an eye sore and unhygienic."

There were kids there from barely walking to around 12 years old, so it's great if you have kids of varying ages in your group. You don't have to pay to get into the fairgrounds, but you DO have to pay if you want to get onto the rides. This is great if you are going with multiple adults that don't want to ride (like grandparents) and they can keep watch of the kids that are not going onto that ride for esample. Be sure to wear proper sneakers if you want to do the rock climbing wall. They are very strict about this. Food on site is quite expensive, so I recommend going into the mall and enjoying the food court food; it's more reasonably priced. Lot's of free parking in the outside parking lot."

We came here with my 3 year old son and my husband brought him on all the rides. There are around 7-8 rides there, and an indoor playground. The whole park is more dated but the rides are quite fun and there is good variety. There is a train ride and carousel for younger kids and indoor playground but most of the slides are closed down.There are lots of snack options like Baskin Robbins and Sweet Jesus as well. We were a bit hesitant to go on the ferris wheel as it makes a loud banging sound and seemed quite old and creaky.As well, my husband got some whiplash from riding a small rollercoaster ride with my son because he is around 6'3 so I would recommend the ride for taller adults."

One thing that really added to the experience was the large robotic dinosaurs that were played all around fantasy fair.

        "You can take your kids to a nice lunch and an indoor playground for way cheaper...the washrooms is so disgusting and not family friendly.... no nursing rooms, the mall is cold cold and uncomfortable the tap water in the washrooms is only cold to freezing the kids did not want to use these facilities we tried a few in the mall because fantasy fair washrooms smelted so gross and was so dirty was out of toilet paper and hand towel ",
        "Also I remembered the ticket price being under $20 for an all day pass last year when I did my child birthday party here ",
        "PLEASE CLEAN UP THE WASHROOM. TURN ON HEAT, AND WARM WATER IN TAPS, ADD WATER FOUNTAINS TO REFILL WATER BOTTLES, ADD A NURSING ROOM AND FAMILY CHANGE ROOM, ADD A COIN MACHINE FOR THE COIN RIDES, CLEAN THE PLACE AND LET SOME LIGHT IN.... AND LOWER THE TICKET PRICE BACK TO WHAT IT WAS HOW CAN YOU CHARGE $32 FOR KIDS RIDE AND ONLY ALLOW THEM TO BE ABLE TO GO ON FOUR RIDES......OUTDATED RIDES.... WORST EXPERIENCE YESTERDAY NEVER AGAIN"

        "Visited on Tuesday night —ALL 3 of your signs say that the park closes at 7pm, however,  the supervisor stated that website closes at 8pm. We came to the mall to shop with 2 children (and knew about the $10 before last hour closing and decided to purchases passes to the rides) they were so disappointed because now we have to wait for extra hour. The supervisor on duty was honestly friendly and was very attentive to what I had to say. This is FALSE advertisement. Instead of using paper to re-do hours, why not make different signs for off season/on season hours? Makes so much more sense.  ",

Our regular hours of operations are posted in the park, however it does also say on that sign that “hours are subject to change”.  We also have our summer hours posted on our website.  I understand that not everyone looks at the website but this is really not something new that we have implemented, it has always been this way.  I will speak to the owners regarding this situation and to see if he is willing to change the hours of operation signs.",

        "Went for a “special” outing with the kids (4, 2 yo old and 5 mo). Family pass $95 (5 Mo free). For the money, we didn’t see a lot of value. The kids did have a good time though - as kids do. Rides were working except for the “iconic” Ferris wheel. We went early, so no lines - that was a bonus. Overall, it’s run down and needs either a reno or a demo. We saw amps in plain sight, not even camouflaged. Personally, he worst part about it were the washrooms. They were filthy and disgusting. I opted to change my baby on the counter instead of the baby changer. Cringed at toddlers using facilities. Not sure if we’d go back as it is now."

My nieces certainly had a lot of fun between the rides and the play zone.  There are a few drawbacks. One is the staff.  With the exception of one smiling staff member, the others all looked depressed and like they wanted to be anywhere but there.  It would create a better atmosphere if they hire employees that were cheerful, talked to the children, etc.  ",
        "Another drawback was the temperature.  It was a bit hot in there.  No AC.  Finally, a bit of updating is needed.  2 of the rides weren't running.  The dinosaurs had broken pieces etc.  Now, despite the drawbacks we had a good time."

        "If an indoor venue encourages the attendance of small children during the summer months it must tell people LOUDLY AND CLEARLY that the venue is not air-conditioned. ",
        "Fantasy Fair gave no such warning and the temperature indoors last Saturday July 20 grew hot enough to become a potential safety concern for children running around the space. ",
        "Air conditioning vents are all over the ceiling but multiple staff confirmed to me that the air conditioning was \"not working\" and that their understanding was that the owner, (I'm told his name is Chris), had no plans to fix it, preferring instead to use the lower cost ceiling fans. Make no mistake, these ceiling fans did NOT properly control the temperature. As for the staff, they appeared uniformly unhappy. They were competent and helpful, but clearly miserable in the heat as well.",
        "The owner's apparent unwillingness - or perhaps financial inability - to repair the air conditioning and ensure a pleasant and safe environment for guests and staff made my wife and I wonder how well the rides were being maintained. ",
        "Unlike temperature, neglect in ride maintenance may go unnoticed by the public until a catastrophe occurs. That thought occurred to us around the time the heat became completely unbearable. ",
        "We were forced to leave, despite the fact that we had paid for the expensive \"passes\" which, it turned out, didn't cover half the rides there (those cost extra), while two of the approximately six rides that the pass did cover, were not operating.",
        "The whole experience felt more like a crooked carnival, trying to con citizens out their hard-earned money, rather than the wholesome family fair it tries to present itself as.",

        "It was overall a great place to spend time with family, especially younger kids, as the rides were mostly entertaining and enjoyable. However, we did notice some safety concerns that we felt should be addressed. On one particular ride, the drop tower, we felt that there was not proper safety protocol put in place, or followed. On most attractions in other amusement parks (I suppose this would be the exception), the staff with the responsibility of operating the ride give the riders a heads-up about the restraints being lifted and put down. After the ride, we were not told to keep our faces or arms away from the restraints when they were abruptly lifted, resulting in the restraint coming into contact quite roughly with my face. While I was not extremely injured, I believe this is a safety concern that must be addressed whether it was lack of safety protocol altogether or failure to enforce it on the staff's part, to ensure future customers stay safe. While I have great respect for customer service representatives and employees, I felt the staff at the Fantasy Fair were slightly unconcerned with customer safety and created an overall unfriendly atmosphere. I have been coming to the Fantasy Fair for a while now, and sincerely hope that the situation can be rectified."

      "text": [
        "I have walked the length of Bay Street from Front Street and northward to Bloor and beyond for exercise. I would recommend it to you for the same reason just to get another view of Toronto. Bay Street closer to Bloor is of greater interest to me. I did find the Manulife Center and went in for a visit. I did find on three occasions the audio store at Bay and Bloor and went inside to see how overpriced the merchandise is. I believe that there is a Chapters bookstore near by and I did visit it for a long rest one afternoon. By knowing the extent of Bay northward to Bloor I was able to discover many places of great interest to me. Finding alternative routes to those same places was pleasing and rewarding to me as well because I travel on foot as a geographer here. Bay Street helped me more than I thought it might just because I knew where it was in relation to other places. I have fond memories of walking along St. Mary's Street and St. Joseph's Street and the area between Yonge and Bay going in the direction of St. Michael's College and its library and the university to the west. Wellesley and Charles Street area also did deserve my attention so I have walked in that area once or twice on my way to Bay and westward to Queens Park. I know that this is the high rent district and I could not readily find an affordable place to live here. This is where approximately my admiration for Bay Street ends if it were not for my discovery of the subway station complex.  That is a different story worth telling anybody who will listen. I have yet to recover fully from using the subway and understanding how the metro system works inToronto. That was perhaps my greatest discovery and biggest lesson. We do not have anything like this where I live. The almost total dizziness I experienced to view and understand the operations of the underground at Bloor and Yonge was repeated when I got to the subway station complex at Bay and Bloor. I had never experienced or seen - with two or three levels of underground lines - such a complex operation at either place. I knew what I had missed studying in school. Waiting for my subway was an adventure during rush hour as I let several crowded trains go by before boarding one with fewer passengers. It took me a long time to know where to go to catch the train that I wanted to take for reaching my destination. I had some fun making mistakes in traveling on the subway - mistakes that I did correct. Like the signs leading people to the correct trains. I have not come from a city with an underground subway so I when I saw the large underground station on two or more levels and their construction complexity at Bay Street I knew that I was in a different place for travel adventure especially having to take moments of reflection to understand what is happening at Bloor and Yonge. I am not coming here to shop as I am not a shopping fanatic at any time of the year. The underground shops around Bay Street Metro stations deserve your attention if only to walk by and browse on your way the subway underground. For the reasons just mentioned the areas around Bloor and Bay and a little farther south do hold my interest especially the two library-like buildings which I visited twice. Yes, I will agree to a limit that your estimate of Toronto as a place to make your vacation here a most memorable visit should not depend on you having walked along Bay Street south of Grosvenor or College in large measure because there is so much here that can be found in many other large cities of this same physical dimension. This conclusion applies more to the area south of Grosvenor. I found parts of Bay Street south of College to be boring and not very attractive. Yes it is convenient to walk along this street to avoid Yonge and other busy streets, but I did not see much to make me want to take pictures and speak favorably about this street to friends back home. More cultural vitality can be found elsewhere in this city. Some parts have little to see to make it a memorable place as a tourist attraction in my opinion. Maybe the planning was not on target for getting more of interest to be found along this street but tall buildings in a crowded area do not make it a place to discuss reasons to visit Toronto. At times I found it boring to walk by the tall buildings not knowing or caring what was inside. I have never driven a car in this area and I think that I would be afraid to under take such an endeavor for safety alone. Now you might understand why a trip in the underground or subway does seem to have its advantages. I have always preferred to travel by the underground or use the subway if I did not want to see what was above ground. Pan-handling people can be found here in larger numbers than what you had suspected perhaps. There is one advantage for taking the subway and then later walking the same  distance above ground. You can estimate how strong your endurance is for undertaking such a walk and how accurate hour estimate of distances is between subway stops. Now for people from far away places with little knowledge of large cities of this nature maybe Bay Street south of Grosvenor and College might be an attraction that I did not find to make me want to write a letter back home. I walked by the tall buildings as I browsed the stores in the underground shopping areas. Too many tall building made me want to explore the Needle tower for another adventure like nothing I had experienced in the past.  I will concede that walking near Union Station and near by streets as crowded as they were was another chance for me to understand how the Canadian transportation system works in bringing many pieces together for the benefit of people. Walking inside Union Station is worth your time for this reason alone just to see how the subway links together with railway train systems. In this regard Toronto is like a city designed by the Swiss for efficiency.  Wellington, King, Richmond and Queen streets were places I wanted to see.  Since I had walked along Bay Street I did see them and got some benefit from seeing them once or twice. Benefits to be gained were abundant. But I do not have to return here for another visit for anything extra. Sky scrapers are almost everywhere here. Things for me to learn were abundant. I like to test my knowledge of the city streets by taking alternative routes to get to different places and my experience in walking along Bay Street did give me that advantage as I was able to find places just because I had walked along Bay. Knowing how to get to the Commensal Restaurant or Nathan Phillips Square by knowing where Bay Street took me was most helpful. Do not dismiss Bay Street  as being totally useless for gaining accurate travel information. Whether or not there is a lot less going on along Bay Street I will leave that up to you. Whether it has much to see as a tourist attraction I have different responses to that question. Depending where you are - north or south of Grosvenor - to a large degree will also depend on what you came to see in Toronto. Sky scrapers are for me are like visiting Disney land. Like wise the subway system and connections with other forms of transportation. Certain problems found in many cities closer to my home can be found here  Was Toronto a safer city to visit because of the rules for safety in effect?  In some respects seeing the sky scrapers and subway connections in down-town Toronto near Wellington, King and Queen Streets and farther south was worth my time. I would not dismiss the value of getting to know Toronto just because some parts of Bay might not be totally pleasing to the eye. I was able to find many places like the German Goethe Center and downtown buildings like churches just because I had walked along Bay. Go there!"

Bay St is good to traverse when you want to avoid the hustle and bustle of Yonge St or University Ave.  There is a lot less going on Bay St.  It is a bit of dead zone, especially after the corporate suits have gone home.  Using Union Station and the Air Canada Centre as a base for Bay St., it acts as a launching pad for where to start your Toronto city adventure.  You head east, you have Yonge St and the life Yonge/Dundas Square and the Eaton Centre, you head west, you have the CN Tower, Chinatown, Little Italy.  Bay Street only helps to get north to south (more so after the construction of Union Station will be complete) through the heart of downtown.  Other than acting as a marker, there is no need to see Bay Street."

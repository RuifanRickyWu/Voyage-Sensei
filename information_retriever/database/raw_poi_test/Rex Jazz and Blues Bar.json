        "The Rex Hotel Jazz and Blues Bar are located at the heart of Toronto Downtown. This place defines a 'cozy place.' The music started at 8.30 PM, as they mentioned on the ticket.  We bought a ticket for Roberto Occhipinti Quartet. We preferred to sit in the bar section, which was very influential in comparing the price and quality.  I can suggest buying a ticket from the bar section if you like. You can see the main scene, don't worry. To have the best personal music listening experience, I suggest going with a maximum of 2 people. You can even feel meditating on the music while you go alone and sip your drink. Rex Jazz and Blues Bar are highly recommended for a relaxing night experience. Prices are fair; you must wait a while to deliver your order. That is the only negative side‚Äîoverall good experience."

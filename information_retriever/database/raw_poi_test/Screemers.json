The one haunted house the one actor/worker had Iâ€™m assuming was his girlfriend and a friend hanging out in there while people were walking through. Was the worst haunted attraction ever!!!! ",

If someone doesn't want to be touched, I want to be able to see them before long enough not to. I get the scare. I love fear and working with it. But touching someone without permission is triggering. Please adjust. It would be just as creepy, minus the trauma."

        "I attended the event on Oct 15th, 2021. There was heavy rain and the rides were not functioning and half of the attractions were closed. While at event I received an email from Sales @ Screemers that stated the following:",
        "\"Hi Everyone,",
        "Due to heavy rain fall we will be closing early you are able to use your tickets any Wednesday, Thursday or This Sunday. You don't need to change your ticket just show up and we will be able to scan tickets.",
        "Thank you for understanding as we are trying to make this experience as great and safe for everyone.",
        "Thank you",
        "Screemers\"",
        "After receiving this at 8:30pm (I was at the event for 1 hour), I opted to leave on account of the rain and the fact that half of the attractions were not open including the rides. Reading that email I figured I'd be able to go on one of the Wednesdays or Thursdays.",
        "I decided to go on Oct 28th and when my ticket was scanned they said that i could not enter because my ticket was previously scanned. I showed them the email that i had received that said my ticket would be able to be scanned and without reading the email, they told me, that in addition to the online ticket, I needed to provide my physical ticket (it's a ticket that lists the attractions at the event. There's nothing to scan or any kind of ID # on the ticket). I had thrown this ticket out because, well it was garabge. I told them that the email did not state that I needed to keep the physical ticket and they said that \"it wasn't their problem\".",
        "Instead of arguing I left and emailed customer service, detailing my experience and their response was this:",
        "\"Hello",
        "The email was for people who were obviously not in the house already. There is no way to scan a ticket that has already been scanned.",
        "Thank you\"",
        "Apparently it was obvious in their previous email that the email didn't apply to people who were already at the event...although I have a hard time understanding how someone picks up on that without it being actually communicate din the email.",
        "Regardless, the whole experience was terrible. The associates and customer service team are a joke and I would reccommend going to one of the many other Halloween attractions that are available in the area over Screemers (Halloween Haunt, Legends of Horror, Horror Hallways etc) all offer a truely great experience!!"

        "Me and my bf went for a date night was fun enough but would have to say I would never go back alot of the decorations while your walking around could be better they look cheap n could have come from the dollar store they should have a lil fog an scary music a few displays were pretty cool like the It .The characters who are walking around trying to scare you should really try harder to look the part some of their make up looks thrown on an wack.The bar does not have much to offer but my rum n cokes were really good the beer they offered was super gross they had drake playing love me some drake but would have rather enjoyed scary music even something like the monster mash.  it would be way more fun if they had more rides n games. Speaking of the games you don't even have to win my boyfriend just had to pay a certain price an we were garanteed a stuff animal which kinda takes the fun out of it. The houses seemed as if they were all the same in the end. Was a great night over all but like a said going once is enough just to say yea I've been"

There was one haunted house called \"the darkness\" it is so dark you can not see a single thing - took the fun out of it. I will continue to go to Halloween Haunt at Wonderland."

Hallowe'en Haunt has been known to spy on Screemers to steal their ideas and styles; and the lines are out the door! so what if you have access to rides if the lines take up half your night?  I think if you are looking for an actual haunted house experience, you will thoroughly enjoy this venue!"

        "We paid $100 for two people for only 7 attractions including the VIP pass. This may seem like a very good deal, but it wasnâ€™t. The haunted houses were very short and not scary. In addition, there are only a few rides that are children rides. You are definitely better off going to Halloween Haunt, for less than $100 for two people (without the VIP pass) with access to 20 haunted houses and all of the rides Wonderland has to offer! Screemers did however have amazing Halloween decorations up which was great to take pictures with, along with the vampire bar and lounge."

        "Have visited this with friends for several years and always have a blast. It consists of about a dozen haunted houses with people jumping out trying to scare you. The layout of each house is very different and they do a great job of casting staff and designing costumes. You can also buy drinks and food and ride the Ferris wheel and several other CNE attractions at night. Lineups are usually nowhere near as heavy as Wonderland's Halloween Haunt which is also a big plus."

  "description": "Situated astride Lake Ontario, Scarborough is a district heavily influenced by immigration. With a number of low-rent shopping and dining options making it a highly affordable part of town, and boasting one of Toronto's largest shopping malls, the otherwise green suburban neighborhood is a good place to go for bargains and discounts. It also draws in photographers. The spires, archways, and cavernous rooms of the BAPS Shri Swaminarayan Mandir Palace are filled with breathtaking art, architecture, and detailed reliefs – it’s like entering a different world, The ruins of columns and installation art at the Guild Inn makes a free-for-all exploration site, while the big-name draw for young photographers is the menagerie at the Toronto Zoo. While many visitors shirk Scarborough as too suburban, its houses are some of Toronto's most mystical and haunting architectural beauties. And for adventure lovers, it has river-rafting and some unique hiking trails.",

This park is transitioning to Canada's first Urban National Park and no doubt there will be more trails and more areas as time goes on, but is is already a really worthwhile place to spend a day in the country in the city. Start at the Twyn Rivers trailhead. If you head north two of the well-marked trails (Vista and Orchard) form a nice loop of almost 5 k. We liked that so much we took the Mast Trail south as well before we called it a day. 30 minutes from downtown. Best with a car but you could do it by taking public transit to the Toronto Zoo and finding the north Vista or Orchard trailhead from there. Other trails are supposed to be nice as well but we did not try them yet. Next visit (and we will be back). "

        "We've visited about 30 National Parks (and Park Reserves) in Canada, and countless provincial parks.  The ball has been rolling on making Rouge River into a National Park (NP) since 2011, but much remains to be done to reach the NP standard, notably better signage (no directional signs from the road, no NP signs in the park), better parking, better facilities (washrooms), more diverse trails, and maybe some \"red chairs\".  Currently, this park seems better suited to locals making short visits to an area, rather than travelers visiting to get a fuller experience.",
        "Currently the park has five main sections:  the river mouth,  the campground, Twyn Rivers, Zoo Road, and Bob Hunter Memorial Park area.  We spent a day strolling (none of the trails we tried would qualify as a \"hike\") around the river mouth, Twyn Rivers and Zoo Road areas.",
        "The river mouth area (signs still indicate Toronto's Rouge Beach Park) has a nicely-restored wetland, a delicate sand peninsula where river meets lake, a beach (likely crowded on a hot day), and a view of waterfront Pickering, especially the nuclear generating station.  Hiking is limited to a nice but very short boardwalk beside the wetland and the paved waterfront cycling trail.",
        "At Twyn Rivers, the parking lot holds about 15 cars;  a few trees could be sacrificed for expansion.   The few interpretive signs on the short Glen Eagles trail are holdovers from the former Rouge Valley Conservation Area.  We saw lots of blue jays and other birds, and had some good views of the valley.  The trailhead on the north side of Twyn Rivers Road seems to be a slim gap between bushes, but in an hour rambling along trails, we saw no trail maps or markers (nor the Celebration forest memorial). ",
        "The Zoo Road area was the best part of our day.  Parking was permitted on the street the day we visited (signs were covered, probably because the Toronto Zoo wasn't using the overflow parking lots nearby).  There was a large parking area on the NP / Conservation Area grounds, but it was closed off.  The only NP logo we saw was on the canvass tent / park office on Zoo Road, but the office was closed during our visit (in October it's open Wed to Sun only).",
        "The short walk around the restored Beare wetland was pleasant (except for a freight train passing on the adjacent track).  The view from the tower (a short walk south of the park office)  highlighted the results of decades of efforts to preserve and restore the natural appearance to the Rouge River valley.  Former properties have been acquired and re-naturalized.  Even the former landfill to the east could pass for a large hill.  As far as the eye could see, it was river valley and vegetation, with no sign of roads or buildings (except for train tracks and a large electricity transmission line).  Pretty impressive for still being within our most populous city. ",
        "Coming from out of town, we wanted to see more than one area of the park, and we weren't confident that public transit would be adequate to get from one area to another.  We will probably visit again (we often pass through this area), but not for another 5 or 10 years - hopefully by then this will be closer to the caliber we expect from a National Park."

        "A wonderful place (in the City) to get away from it all and connect with nature. Various entry points and trails provide different landscapes and views to swoon over. It’s amazing how many people don’t know about The Rouge or take advantage of it. We’ve done guided hikes and exploration on our own as a family and it’s a beautiful gem we are so lucky to have!"

        "Enjoy nature near the city year round. Rouge National Urban Park is a wonderful place to walk, hike, bird watch and it's all free of charge. During the off-season there is free parking. It's also close to the Metro Zoo. Ponds are a great place to observe water fowl, turtles and beavers in the spring and summer. The rivers host spawning salmon in the fall. There are spectacular views and look outs and various levels of challenge from walking on the flat to climbing up steep inclines. In addition, the site includes some interesting historical buildings."

        "Rouge Marsh Trail: A stunning view of the largest remaining wetland in the City of Toronto. The trail is a very short walk, great for skill level. With an abundance of nature photography opportunities, the trial is limitless for someone with a creative eye. Also great for selfie-takers!",
        "Mast Trail: A great hike that I’m looking forward to doing in the summer months. As there is no winter maintenance for Rouge Park, there was a LOT of dog droppings and it was extremely slippery – particularly when you get to the uphill areas. The downfall per each season, however, is the lack of signage throughout (from beginning to end). At one point, there is a fork in the road (three different trails) and you’re not quite sure which one to go down. In the summer, this wouldn’t be a major issue, but in the winter it may have been risky. My friend slipped 3 times, but I found it fairly intermediate in the winter. Definitely do it in the summer if you’re new to hiking!!"

And it's so relaxing! I highly recommend this place for exercising, just relax at the shores of the creek or for a picnic."

        "Simcoe day is a busy holiday, lots of summer cottage traffic and crowded beaches, but this year I was looking to find a quick and close getaway for an afternoon picnic swim. We’ll Rouge Park is great. There is a kind of 60s/70s working class/family vibe going on...tons of families from the Indo/Canadian; Asian Canadian diaspora with fabulous picnic meals on display. People set up sun tents and umbrellas and swim and lounge. A train passes overhead. The mouth of the Rouge River meets Lake Ontario with fishing possibilities and paddling through march grass. There are paths for hiking and the sandy Bottomley swimming beach is perfect. I was reminded of my childhood when working class families would venture all throughout Canadian towns looking for affordable relief from the summer heat and where families bond. The makeup of the cross section of families has shifted a bit from my childhood, but beautifully so. A reminder of some of the multi-cultural direction of a city like Toronto that works. And my puppy had a ball too. Lots of dogs."

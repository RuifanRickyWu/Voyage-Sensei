        "I took my wife here to experience some humour. I asked them if we could see some stand up comedy. They said to see Chris Locke and Steve Patterson. They made a lot of what I thought was improv. They just seemed to be winging it. Their jokes were all about their discomfort with male on male sexual contact. When I teased them a bit, saying \"Say something funny\", they teased me back for awhile. I didn't say anything, but then when I went to get a beer, they had me thrown out. It was my wife's birthday.

The venue is super close to the subway, the stage has a great presence and sound, and THE SHOW! I laughed so so hard! Some of the performers are also producers and were so friendly to speak to after the show. They said they hold the show monthly there, very worth checking out if you are in the city!"

        "Went to the Danforth location  last night to the Back to the Future show and it was awesome! As there is a lot of improv in the show each show would be a bit different.  Although there was audience interaction the days of heckling are long gone thank God!!!  They also serve food and drinks right to your seat.  My only complaint is the space is small and they really pack them in very tightly so if one was to get food it would be difficult eating it in such tight quarters. I see someone else commented that the show space was very hot and luckily last night being early spring the temperature was comfortable but can definitely see how it would get hot in the summer month with so many people packed into that space.  Regardless, we really enjoyed ourselves and the only negative was our jaws hurt from laughing so much!!  Will definitely be back!!"

The tickets where reasonably priced at $10 and the show itself was hilarious. It was my first time at an improv event so I wasn't sure what to expect but all the teams and Jason the host nailed it and I was laughing out loud all evening. The bar staff where friendly and the place has a good selection of reasonably priced beer. If you are in Toronto this is a brilliant place to go and have a good laugh. I highly recommend checking out the catch 23 show if you can."

The price was $50 each evening, and this was because he is a big name. I see regular nights go as low as $10 for a evening of entertainment!  Contrary to what I have read online, I found the venue to be clean, organized, not too loud. There is a full bar. I didn't look for a menu so I'm sorry I can't comment. The bathroom (women's) is clean. There was no bad smell from the kitchen as I have read online. Check online for their schedule...there are lots of big comedians, and tons of beginners.",

But the worst part was the jokes were terrible. It seemed the entire audience were friends of the comedians, many being fake laughing loudly. Honestly the jokes were poor, I've seen far better at Yuk Yuk's & Second City. Don't waste your time & money here."

It's also a more intimate seating area and makes it feel more important and better quality. The location is great, right across from Ossington subway station on Bloor. It's located in a very good and trendy neighbor hood. Lots of places to eat and drink at before or after the show. If you want comedy in Toronto come to this place."

Big names often show up here after their headlining shows elsewhere in the city and every now and then a surprisingly well known comedian will do a small intimate show here for an insanely low price. I saw Scott Thompson do stand-up here once for $5, before he did a show in NYC. That sums it up right there. ",

        "\"Exhibit A\" was certainly an interesting twist on shoes from and about crime.  Lots of thought went into what to include and the background of the exhibits.  \"Dressed to Impress\"  A trip down through the 80s.  Great examples of shoes from that era.  Be sure to watch the movie, it has great material from that era.  There was supposed to be another exhibit \"Behind The Scenes\" on the main floor but the doors were locked.  Also the 3rd floor exhibit area is closed at the moment.  So although the open exhibits were interesting, it is not great value for entrance fee.  Other museums reduce the fee when a large number of exhibits are closed."

Unfortunately, (well fortunately for the museum) it was so crowded that we tried waiting in line for our \"turn\" to read the displays, and it took over 20 minuets before we were able to read the first one. After reading the first one we figured we would be able to move on to the next.  The line didn't move.  We finally just got out of the line and looked at the displays over peoples shoulders. I know we missed a ton of really good information and interesting details but I didn't want to spend 3 hours in here.  Instead, we ended up in here around 45 minutes.",

Mrs Bata spent her life collecting shoes, some over 4000 years old. It is beautifully presented and curated. The museum has the biggest collection of shoes in the world. We saw more of her collection at the museum of Art in Ottawa, displaying magnificent Inuit shoes. A must go."

It takes you through the history of shoes and has a section on shoes in different religions that was fascinating.  The whole place uses shoes as a tool to discuss history, culture, religion, race, and privilege.  (I do not think it will offend anybody’s political sensibilities unless you are very pro-colonialism & slavery.  It is not commentary on today’s political hot buttons.) If you are looking to see lots of glamorous shoes of today, you will be disappointed.  They are here, but not the focus.  The future exhibit was boring compared to the rest of Bata’s exhibits, but it will appeal to science people and eco-minded thinkers.  It was well worth the C$14, and it is open on Mondays unlike most museums here.  (There is a good vegetarian restaurant near Bata called Fresh, if you are looking to eat nearby.)"

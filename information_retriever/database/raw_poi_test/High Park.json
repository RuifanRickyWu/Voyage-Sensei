My suggestion is to mark the gates with numbers (These are areas where the dogs are able to roam freely) . This numbering system will help to navigate the park with confidence. We wondered around but was constantly wondering where we were. The park is wonderful but definitely not easy to find your way around. Make sure you have lots of time to ask people where you are in the park."

However, I feel that I must add to the comment about the disgusting toilet facilities. While I haven't experienced these particular washrooms lately, I have been in other ones in Toronto parks and they are disgusting, embarrassing really. I live in Port Credit and ride my bike a lot in both cities. There is a huge difference in washroom maintenance between the two cities: Mississauga cleans them; Toronto doesn't. This is inexcusable for Canada's \"premier\" city. If it's a matter of funding, then don't waste precious dollars on silly things like renaming Dundas Street when you can't afford to provide the basic amenities people should, and do, expect from their cities. It's not rocket science."

After a short walk from the restaurant parking lot we saw a number of photographers aiming their telephoto lenses at a conifer, and with the aid of binoculars we soon saw the mother on the nest and the father in a nearby tree. We didn't see the two chicks: next time. Afterwards we drove down to the ponds in the southern part of the park and admired the ducks and a lone turtle sunning him or herself on a rock. Nice walks in beautiful late afternoon sunshine. Highly recommended, especially in this time of Covid!"

The gardens were beautifully maintained. A number of washrooms were available throughout the park area. We travelled by Subway to High Park Station and it was a short walk to enter the park at Colborne Lodge Drive, Bloor Street West. It's about a 20 min walk (1.5kms) to the Zoo section.

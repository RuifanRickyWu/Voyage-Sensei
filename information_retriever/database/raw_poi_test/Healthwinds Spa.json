Areas were wrapped in plastic and well sanitized. Fresh white linens and white towel as well. Due to COVID showers and steam room not available (for obvious reasons) but look forward to being able to check them out.",
        "2) My therapy was EXCELLENT. Sue was the therapist that worked on me today. Very knowledgeable about energy pathways and did a thorough assessment of my body both hands off and hands on before beginning treatment. ",
        "3) I was given homework and exercises to do in the interim! I’m so thankful for professionals who share their secrets - it makes me want to go back for more!",

The event was not only extremely well executed by the staff at Healthwinds, but Kailee Kline was extremely accommodating to us throughout the organizing of the event and the day itself.  The facilities are clean, well equipped, soothing and very well maintained.  Lunch was provided to us during our event and the food was plentiful and very tasty.  The staff was not only highly qualified, but easy to talk to and very open and informative about the types of treatments they were providing.  Thank you for a wonderful event Kailee and the Healthwinds team."

        "I don't have any complaints about the massage therapist,  but there wasn't a heating blanket on the table and the air condtioner was on with a very loud fan. I requested the therapist to ask the reception to turn it off as it was very distracting. Overall, i had a medicore experience and would not return."

Her integrity is impeccable: careful selection of products, and staff, to deliver on promises. Her staff is attuned and deeply caring. I leave always better, wondering why I didn't book a massage sooner than I did. (For those requiring deep work, see Katerina, a gift to athletes and others requiring deep work. And Victor is an extraordinary healer.) ",

        "I have been working a lot lately and have been finding myself quite stressed from work. My husband insisted that I go to a spa to relax and just get a way from it all. I decided to go to Healthwinds as I've heard great things from my girlfriend who goes there religiously. I went for an hour massage, manicure and facial and was blown away with the level of service that was provided. I have chronic back pain and the masseuse really took the time to help relieve the strain from my lower back as well as show me different types of stretches that I could do on my own that would help relax the lower back muscles. The facial left my face glowing all day long that even my husband noticed a difference. ",
        "All in all Healthwinds is a true top notch 5 star spa experience. The staff is extremely professional and friendly. I would definetly recommend this spa to anyone who is looking to pamper themselves."

        "I was very excited to try this spa. I finally waited for 8 weeks for my next facial and made an appointment. Receptionist was very nice, spa is very nice, welcoming and warm.",
        "However, I did not like that I was not told to change into a robe or use the steam room/sauna.",
        "I came in 15 minutes early and simply sat waiting. I then asked the receptionist if I should change and/or if I could use the steam since I am in for a facial (it only makes sense).",
        "She said no, I shouldn't. Then told me to change into a robe, later she told me to go into the steam.",
        "The facial was very disappointing. Probably one of the worst ones for a very pricey price. The esthetician barely did any extractions. About 8. Then simply laid mask upon mask. There was no \"cleaning\" or the wand used to disinfect my face. ",
        "Overall, the location is great with lots of parking (1 hr free). It is a very chic, modern, calm setting. I would never go back to this spa again. :("

        "As I have not had many massage therapy sessions in the past, I was somewhat skeptical about the outcome, but the level of professionalism and knowledge the staff at Healthwinds had really blew me away.  From the moment I walked in, I was very impressed with the level of service in the main greeting area, and the sheer size of the location (much bigger than expected).  My wait time was virtually non-existent and we started right on schedule.  The registered massage therapist (Lindsay) really made me comfortable and walked me through any key items and insights as we went, to ensure she met my expectations and listened to me.",

        "Upon entering Healthwinds, the reception area is bright and lovely with a juice/tea/snack bar and a shopfront full of all kinds of spa soaps and sundries including robes, flip flops, scented epsom salts and essential oils (I really enjoyed looking at and testing these products).  Beyond the doors and into the spa waiting area, it is relaxing and zen-like, flanked on one side by a strange, albeit sooting electric fireplace and \"water wall\".  Spa music plays and there is a nice tea station behind one of the partitions as well as flavoured water, iced tea and apples to enjoy while you read magazines and wait for your services (I was quite impressed by how discreet and respectful the staff was when they had to pass through this area or refresh the beverages).  However, the change room was perplexing...though bright and minimalist (literally), it had almost no toiletries or spa products, save for the hand soap and hair gel in the common area and body wash/ shampoo/conditioner in the 2 showers.  It would have been nice to have some moisturizer or some of the other products out front showcased in here.  Change room was clean but could have been cleaner and would be much nicer if it was more spa-like instead of gym-like...could absolutely use an overhaul and some TLC. The steam room needs some updating but was a nice experience.  RMT Chris gave me a very attentive and thoughtful massage (75 minutes for $118), a perfect balance between her training and intuition and I would definitely re-book with her.  Value of services is very good, prices and array of services are excellent.  No free parking, you can park on the street for one hour or in the Green P parking lot in the same building (I paid $7.00 for about 2 hours). All in all, I will add Healthwinds to my list of spas, albeit further down on the list as one of my backups.  If this spa had a better change room experience and more amenities (i.e., sauna and whirlpool) my rating would be 4 out of 5."

I wanted to see a Maple Leaf's game whilst in Toronto but they weren't playing so we ended up going to see the Toronto Marlies instead (I think basically what would be equivalent to their division 2 / feeder team to the Leaf's) and it was a great game at a fraction of the cost. My wife has never been to a hockey game before and loved it, the atmosphere was great. The venue itself is easy to get to with food and drink stalls all around it that weren't actually that bad value. Well recommend"

Tickets are around 30 dollars vs 150+ for the maple leafs. I don't have any knowledge about hockey, but when in Canada wanted to see a game. Looking at price this was the best option. AHL league is a good level from what i understand. Speed of the game about the same, tactical a little bit less than nhl. However i didnt notice, because i dont know nothing about tactics in hockey. Anyway i had great time and it was bobblehead night so also a free gift"

        "If you like hockey and you are in Toronto, come to see the Toronto Marlies at the (newly re-named) Coca Cola Coliseum @ Exhibition place. Seeing a hockey game at the Coliseum is a wonderful, noisy, fun-filled event. Tickets are very reasonably priced and there's not a bad seat in the house. There are pre-game activities, in between period events and lots of music too. Families and groups of friends have a great time. The Marlies may not be as great as they were last year but there are some future Toronto Maple Leafs in the making. So if you visit Toronto but want to have a \"small town, community feeling\" then come out to a Marlies game! The Coliseum is easily accessible by public transit, GO transit and walking from Liberty Village area. Parking tip- there is a lot directly below the arena area and it is the same price (usually $15) as the surface lot. You stay warm, out of the elements and get this great deal!"

No soup spoons on the table we had to ask for them, had to ask for water, they were serving from both the left and the right- no training at all.  The food was just ok but a huge disappointment from past years as they moved to a fixed menu from a buffet.  We won't be back for sure.  Whoever was hired to do the catering is an embarrassment to the Royal."

        "I was pretty much blown away by the The Royal. I've seen horse jumping on TV but this is a big deal.  Some attendees are dressed formally and I can say that I have never seen so many tuxes and gowns in one place.  Not knowing that this was the case I had on jeans and a dress shirt.  But that was OK because a good portion of the crowd was also more casual and in jeans.  It was amazing to see. My wife loves horses and this was a surprise birthday present. Even watching the set-up and measuring of the jumping course was interesting as were the other events such as the Canada vs.US in a polo exhibition. The other events also had gorgeous horses and well attired participants who seem to be masters of their craft. The riders in the main event were all world class with Olympic champions, world champions and participants from at least 7 countries.  This isn't a casual horse show at the county fair, this is the best of the best and it feels like you hold your breath and lean into the jumps and you cheer them all on - both riders and horses. The men were generally very dapper and the women were stunningly beautiful with gowns, jewels, heels and almost like a bit of a yacht club meets Kentucky Derby meets State Fair with the world class horse events, horses and riders.  Unforgettable and I'd return to Toronto just for this event. It was work to keep my jaw from dropping here."

You can get stir-fry to eat while watching the game! No stir-fry in ACC!! It's always a little bit cold in there during hockey games so winter clothing is a must have. Hat and coat. Lots of cheap parking outside and underground. I love this place, it's not as modern or classy as the ACC but it's a hundred year old building so it has it's own charm."

The only downfall with the venue is there are no restaurants or bars outside the arena in Exhibition Place to go before the or after the game, you have to leave the site and go to Liberty Village about a 15 minute walk or 10 minute drive.

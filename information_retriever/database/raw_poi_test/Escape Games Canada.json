This place was pretty nice, I like how they set up up in the lobby to wait, we did The Unknown first and I absolutely loved it, we were on edge the whole experience. The second room we did was Mindshaft, I could have completely done without this room, it’s not really a typical escape type room more of a multiple brain teaser room that you play over and over until it’s time to progress to the next room. We were so bored in the final room, we could have walked out before our time was up. If we lived in the area I would still have loved to come back and done some of the other rooms they offered."

I would not suggest this room for beginners but I would encourage everyone to go get some escapes under their belt and then come to this place. It’s worth the premium price. ",
        "Lastly, a star in this room is the hint mechanism. It actually allows you to continue trying puzzles/working things out rather than fighting over whether or not to call for a hint. It helped us pace the game really nicely and it works wonderfully in the narrative."

      "text": [
        "I'm actually writing this review some time after I went to Escape Games and did their \"Noriko\" room, however the entire experience is still completely fresh in my mind (And in a good way, I mean). I've been to several other escape room attractions across southern Ontario, but this one blew all those other ones out of the water by far. Allow me to list the pros and cons of this escape experience to let you know my opinion on it as a novice escape room fanatic:",
        "+ The atmosphere/production value was second to none. Of all the escape room attractions I've been to, this is the only one where I truly felt immersed in the world the game presented. Sure, there were a few non-authentic props here and there, but that's just being nitpicky if you're to complain about it. The room truly felt scary, without needing to rely on jumpscares or other typical scary elements. ",
        "My favourite memory of this rom: I went with my brother and his friends, who are all your typical early twenties dudebro type figures. When presented with a new area to explore, all of us were bottlenecked at the entrance arguing back and forth 'No, you go first! No, you go first!'. It was hilarious to see these macho dudes all terrified to enter a room. ",
        "+ Speaking of the atmosphere, the story of the room was excellently crafted. It's not just one of those rooms where they throw you into a room with a bunch of puzzles and go \"here, get out.\" They truly tell a captivating story to get you hooked in the room, and give you a meaningful goal to achieve while in there that concludes the story. It was such a wonderful touch and really spoke miles about the dedication these guys put into their experiences. ",
        "+ The tech of the room was also amazing. This isn't one of those rooms where the only things you're doing are finding the codes to combination locks. There's some seriously high tech stuff in here that adds a level of professionalism to the already rather breathtaking experience. We experienced no technical difficulties either, everything worked perfectly smooth from start to finish. ",
        "+ The staff was very friendly and helpful, me and the woman at the front desk had a nice conversation before we did the room and the gentleman who came to greet us at the end was also quite willing to talk about the room and our performance. It made me feel very welcome and definitely left a smile on my face. ",
        "- Now, here's one of my two complaints if I had to choose any: This room seemed almost too easy. The website listed it as an 'advanced' room and recommended you play with 7-10 players. Even the woman we bought tickets from commented on how we might not be able to complete the room considering most of them were first-timers and there were only 5 of us (The bare minimum the room allows). We completed the room with over 20 minutes to spare! I can't tell if we're all just very smart, or if the room is overcompensating on the difficulty. ",
        "- The hint system was both great and not so great. It was great because of the tech and how it was implemented, I found it a very innovative way to create a hint system rather than just the usual \"Speak into the walkie talkie to get a hint\". However, a fair warning for anyone wanting a hint: These are not 'hints'. A hint, in my mind, should gently nudge the players in the right direction for how to solve the puzzle, pointing out things they may not have noticed and giving them a clue on how to solve it. This is not the 'hint' button, it's the 'okay dummy, let me show you how to solve this' button. It essentially gives you a complete walkthrough on how to solve a puzzle. So fair warning, don't press one of the hint buttons unless you're absolutely stumped and don't mind essentially skipping the puzzle. ",
        "Well, there we are! My complete review of Noriko at Escape Games! An amazing experience from start to finish, just a few details short of being a perfect 5/5 experience. I wholeheartedly recommend, and am quite excited to go back and try one of their other experiences. I was afraid my brother's friends wouldn't be as into it as I am (I'm a super geek and they're... the opposite), but they all couldn't stop talking about it for nearly hours after we went! We're all very excited to go back and try out \"The Unknown\", as we could hear the screams of it's victims from all the way inside the lobby. I bet that one's a treat!"

We were divided into two groups, a group of 5 in Mayan and a group of 7 in Prison. While we did not manage to escape, we enjoyed every minute of being in the room. The staff was very friendly, they greeted us, helped us set up, walked us in the room, gave us flashlights when we asked for it, and at the end when we did not finish the game, they walked us through the rest.

        "We did the Unknown, Myan Curse and Bleak Prison. Other reviews made these sound like it would be such an awesome and intense experience. Maybe these people don't get out much. It wasn't that great. Nice sets, but not scary or intense. The staff weren't  friendly and were in fact fairly short with us. We came as a large group and did three of their rooms. They were not welcoming and it seemed like we were just a pain to them despite the fact that we dropped over 600 bucks there for 45 not very entertaining minutes. It was actually the worst customer service I've had in quite a while. Overall it was very disappointing and it really took the whole groups energy down a notch. Don't listen to the reviews making this sound like you will be involved in something incredible. Its not. There are better ones in Toronto. I would recommend you try somewhere else. We wish we hadn't chosen Escape Games Canada and just spent our money elsewhere."

The puzzles were great but there was not enough of them, as there is an actor and because of him the game has many different twists. As far as I know, there is also quite a few different endings to it. A very special adventure, you should definitely try it. Unfortunately, they don't take pictures which is really bad."

I would say this particular room is not for beginners but for a more experienced player you must try this out if you are in the area! ",

        "I can’t say it enough, the quality of these rooms is phenomenal and the staff are wonderful!",

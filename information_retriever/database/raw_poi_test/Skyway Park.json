For me the service I received was excellent! I chose the valet service, brought my car to their lot, went in, paid, was told where to wait when I returned, was given a vehicle number to quote and the number to call shuttle when returning (returning at 3am) and the shuttle was right there to pick me up and take me to airport, no waiting, dropped off where I needed to be at airport. On return, went to where I was to be picked up, called office, gave the vehicle number, was told 10 minutes, the shuttle arrived in less time than that at 3am. My car was running, lights on, warmed up at the lot, I put my bags in and off I went. Less money than Park N Fly and the line for Park N Fly shuttles was long on my return, there were many still waiting for the next Park N Fly shuttle (only so many can go in the shuttle at one time) while I was already off to get my car. Would I use this service again, absolutely!"

It was not a paved parking lot, and there was no one on duty when we arrived, which was a little concerning since so many cars are parked there with what appeared to be no security during the day.  I asked the driver about this when he arrived, and he advised that there was a security guard at night.  We had provided our return flight details, yet had to wait about 20 minutes for the van to arrive.  We called as soon as we had retrieved our luggage as instructed, but it appears that there are only one or two vans operating at a time, so therefore, customers have to wait.  In the meantime, while we were waiting, we had counted 10 Park'n Fly vans come by.  If Skyway Park is serious about their business, they need to improve customer service.  Also, the van was not very clean."

I was told, “it was fine driving up here, it must be a slow leak as that can happen when your car sits for a while”.  I said to them “not likely as it has sat for a week and it would have been flat before you drove here and you would have noticed it riding on the rim, and you were going to let me drive away with a flat in this weather” I asked for the manager to contact me the next day.",

        "I've used Skyway Park for many, many years in business and always had great service.  Recommended them over all the others, always. This time, I inquired about long-term parking.  I was speaking with the manager and got his name and cell #.  He appreciated the compliments I gave regarding the many years, and he said they were not like the others but had integrity.  I explained I did not yet have my return date but would need 5, possibly 6 weeks.  He gave me a rate for 30 days and assured me there would be NO ADDITIONAL CHARGE.  What a load of bull that was.  ",
        "When we knew our return flight plans, I called and gave the details.   Our flight was delayed a couple hours but we were picked up by the shuttle when I called.   My car was waiting for us, but I was held hostage at 2 in the morning with grandchildren for the keys.  I was told I was 2 weeks over the return date, and they wanted over $500 to get the keys.   I was dumb founded.  Surely, there was a mistake.  \"No additional charge\" was what the manager had told me when I booked it.   ",
        "After arguing with the attendant and even trying the managers cell I ended up paying an additional $269 to get my keys, only to go to the car and find out there was an additional 37 km put on my car.   They said it was moved to another lot.   That's a lot of km.   I have contacted the manager on numerous occasions, and each time, there is an excuse regarding a refund.  I contacted them again last week and was told a partial refund had been given, but I have never received it. He would call me back.  It not has happened.  I want a full refund for the overcharge of $269 not a partial.  Stand by your word!",
        "If there was a lower rating, I would give it.  I was lied to and now being put off, and I will never use or recommend them to anyone.  Stay far away.  I don't know what happened to them, but there is no integrity in this manager, that's for sure."

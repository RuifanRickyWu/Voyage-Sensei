        "This was probably a fun spot pre-COVID, but we were a group of seven that went last night and I probably won‚Äôt be back.  $10 cover and $45 for a pitcher of sangria.  Cash only.  Mandatory 20% tip and a requirement to settle your bill with every drink purchase.  Entry and a round of drinks was $240!  With a two hour sitting limit (though the place was empty).  The vibe was dull (though the Queens did their absolute best to hype up the tiny crowd).  It just all felt forced and NOT worth it.  The waitress was almost impossible to find and failed to share all the specials which resulted in us being over charged For shots.  Then they said they would move us to the street because they needed the table for the next group.  When we were ready to move, they didn‚Äôt have a space for us on the street.  So we went somewhere else.  I get that places need to charge more to re-coup losses, but I need to see some value for my investment and this just felt like a huge cash grab.  Not remotely comparable to any place we‚Äôve visited post-COVID and in my opinion, not worth it."

The drag queens were extremely entertaining (i.e. excellent dancers, told hilarious jokes, interacted with the crowd, etc.), the bar staff were extremely friendly (the guy at the bar knew my drink order by the end of the night), and, contrary to what many people have said on here, my friends and I had no issues with the security guards on duty whatsoever-- all they really did were check people's bags, which I personally don't have a problem with. Also, everyone who my friends and I met in here was super friendly and welcoming! In short, our visit to Crews & Tangos was probably our favorite thing we did while in Toronto, and we would gladly go back!"

My friend's daughter danced competitively for 13 years and was very impressed with her talent. We left around 11ish as it got too crowded and much too loud for us. "

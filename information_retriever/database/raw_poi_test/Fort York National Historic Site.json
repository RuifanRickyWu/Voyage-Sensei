  "description": "Explore Canada's largest collection of original War of 1812 buildings and take part in year-round special events on this 43-acre site.. Built in 1793, Fort York National Historic Site is the birthplace of urban Toronto. It is best known as the location where the Battle of York came to its violent climax in 1813 during the War of 1812. The Fort served as the city's primary harbour defence between the 1790s and the 1880s, and was the home of a military garrison until the 1930s. Today, its defensive walls enclose Canada's largest collection of original War of 1812 buildings. Every year, thousands of people visit the site to explore its fascinating history and enjoy its public programs. Fort York is one of 10 historic sites operated by the City of Toronto. Toronto's Historic Sites engage visitors, inspire passion, challenge ideas and connect the past to the present.",

I spent the rest of the time walking around the buildings, some you could enter, others you couldn't.  I was there around 2 hours.  There are washrooms in the visitor center and within the fort near the shop.  It was a little confusing finding the entrance to the visitor center.  It was the 4th door down along Fort York Blvd."

      "text": [
        "Today's Toronto grew up around a British frontier fort built on the northern shore of Lake Ontario in the 1790s. Originally called York, the city was renamed in 1834. Oddly enough, the garrison itself was never actually called Fort York during its original military days, picking up the name much later during the preservation movement that kept it intact as the city grew up around it.",
        "The most dramatic incident in the fort's early history occurred during the War of 1812 when would-be foreign conquerors, i.e., American troops, bent on conquering Canada (the Canadian viewpoint) attacked the fort and surrounding community. Upon abandoning the garrison, the British troops detonated the post's magazine killing numerous Americans including general and explorer Zebulon Pike. Fearing future invasion attempts, the British rebuilt and expanded the fort, and it is this incarnation that has been preserved and is now open to visitors.",
        "While almost all of the building contained in the present park are original, some changes have occurred over the years. Perhaps the most obvious is that the fort is no longer on the Lake Ontario shore. During the growth of Toronto, landfill efforts moved the shore to its present location to better accommodate shipping, railroads, and eventually highways. During the depression in the 1930s, the fort gained the stone walls around its periphery as part of a public works project. While these certainly look nice, the original fort never had them. More subtle changes have affected the structures within the for, e.g., the blockhouses today have ground level entrances to make them more accessible to visitors – to make them more defensible, the original entrances were on the upper level. Of course, the structures themselves have been repurposed to serve as museum galleries and interpretive reconstructions. ",
        "We decided to see all this for ourselves on a hot Sunday morning. Our first surprise came when we approached the lot to the park's visitor center. It was roped off and the staff member guarding it told us to drive around the block to another lot. When we got to this lot, the person there told us it was reserved for vendors – hmm, this is getting interesting – and told us to go to yet another lot which we found to be full. This exhausted all of the parking in the immediate vicinity, so we were left to our own devices to find street parking several blocks away. Some 30 minutes later we finally got back to the fort's grounds. As we approached, we heard a lot of loud modern music (which seemed somewhat out of place at an 18th century fort) and saw lots and lots of people (again a bit surprising for a history museum). Apparently some sort of event was booked into the grounds outside of the fort itself. To get away from the crowds, we bypassed the visitor center and went directly to the gift shop at the entrance to the garrison compound itself where we paid the $14 Canadian adult admission price.",
        "From there, we went next door where there is a gallery which offers an overview of the fort's history through a series of information panels and a short video. We then joined a short 30 minute tour by one of the docents of the fort's architectural features – there are many such tours given during the day on a variety of subjects. We then went off on our own to tour all of the various buildings on site. As mentioned previously, some buildings like the officer's quarters and enlisted barracks have been fitted out to show the accommodations of the soldiers stationed here. Other buildings have been turned into museum galleries – some highlighting weapons, others uniforms, still others with archaeological artifacts found during various digs on the grounds, etc.",
        "One thing that surprised us during our wanderings was the lack of staff members – at most such sites, you find costumed staff members all over the place talking about day-to-day life, answering questions, etc. In one building, we opened a door to a back chamber to find one staffer in costume reading a paperback, while in another we found a larger group munching on Subway sandwiches – but otherwise all we saw were other paying tourists.",
        "We did find another troubling problem when we went into the restrooms on the grounds. Someone has apparently used very high concentration ammonia as a cleaner or disinfectant in the facilities. Our eyes immediately started watering and burning, and our air passages started to close up. We did our business and quickly exited, but we can imagine someone with a respiratory problem like asthma would have been at serious risk had they gone in there.",
        "These issues aside, we still had a pretty good time learning about early Toronto and Canadian views on the War of 1812. Overall, we were here for about two hours (not counting the half an hour trying to find parking). We suggest if you want to visit that you double check to make sure that no special event is on tap as they don't seem to have a good plan for handling parking for that and still accommodate visitors to the fort itself."

During the War of 1812 (April 1813 to be exact) US forces wrested control of the Fort from the Brits, Canadians, and First Nations and used it as a base to loot and burn the growing town (including Parliament).  It was for this action that the Brits burned the US White House in August 1814.  My wife and I enjoyed the exhibits and restored encampments near the heart of Toronto.

The history of Toronto and Canada in general was presented in a very interesting and professional way. The original buildings were the highlight. I highly recommend this to anyone at all interested in the history of Toronto and North America in general. Excellent job."

        "I was a little hesitant to bring fifty 12 year olds to the Fort having not been myself, but it could not have been better organized! We got there and were immediately met by our guide, Mike. He was excellent - very engaging, a great sense of humour. There was a cute gift shop there that the students were very excited about. We also had a lunch room for them to eat, though they were free to explore the fort at this time too. ",

In the visitorcenter there is a short movie which get you started in the history, and from the center it is a short walk to the site itself. There are hourly tours around the fort included, but the site is also pretty selfguided with the informationpanels provided. When interested in historyand specially Toronto’s (why you see everywhere the name York for instance?) this place is a must. Easily reachable with the streetcar and can spend a few hours here."

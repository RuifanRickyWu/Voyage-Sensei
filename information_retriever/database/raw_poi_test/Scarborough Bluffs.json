However, after that, we drove around forever trying to find the trail and could not find it. We were following signs with arrows to the “waterfront trail” and just would end up back on the main road without finding any cliff trail. We also noticed that many of the trail signs contradicted one another and pointed in opposite directions. It was very disappointing overall because we drove an hour outside of Toronto specifically to walk this trail. Perhaps it is easier to find during peak season because people are around to point you in the right direction. Good luck finding it!"

Been to many of the other parks which are also nice places like High Park. But this is my favorite. Sometimes people come here just to park there car and take in the scenery. Or walk up to one of the many rocks and sit and look out to the lake and the scenery of the many sail boats and the bluffs."

By car, also slow, but far easier....and frankly...the drive down the road to lake level is worth the drive. Pretty spot with facilities and plenty of parking available. TONS of Canada geese means TONS of poop, so maybe flip fliops aren't the most practical of footwear if you intend to walk ; )   I suggest taking a picnic or snack, or have a bite at the resto in the marina with pleasant views over the boats there. Lots of cool liveaboard houseboats to gawk at with the sandy cliifs as a stunning backdrop...."

Breaching fences, disregarding notices re: not climbing close to the edge  for selfies is causing  problems for all, including first responders.  Some areas are being fenced off due to this  causing anger and concern for wildlife  in the community.  The Cliffs can also collapse and have done at times .  Please  come to Scarborough but travel in a respectful and safe manner.  The Bluffs are now frequently patrolled and many fines are being issued for not obeying the safety notices.

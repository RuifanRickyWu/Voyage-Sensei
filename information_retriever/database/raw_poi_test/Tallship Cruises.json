We were actually out on the lake for around 90 minutes but it didn‚Äôt cost much more than a 45 minute harbour cruise.  The weather was fabulous and we had some amazing views of the city skyline.  There was food available on board although we didn‚Äôt want anything.  A lovely start to our trip!"

        "I recently took the tall-ship boat cruise around Toronto Harbour, and it was an unforgettable experience! The schooner itself, a stunning 1930s vessel, added a unique charm to the entire trip. Watching the crew raise the sails and even getting to help out was such a cool touch. The views of Toronto's skyline and islands were absolutely breathtaking, offering perspectives you don‚Äôt typically get on regular tours. The atmosphere was relaxed, with drinks and snacks available on board, and the sea shanties really set the mood. The cannon firing was an unexpected and exciting highlight. Highly recommend this for anyone looking for a fun and scenic adventure on the water!"

        "It was an interesting experience to sail for 1.5 hour, however, $45 per person is too much, considering that you have to find yourself a spot to sit and there are not enough spots, so if you are late, you need to stand the entire time (of course, there are places on the lower floor, but there are no windows). The ship only sails to a specific point and back, so after 30 minutes you get bored and start using your phone. In my opinion, it's better to buy a ticket to islands for $15 and you will be able to get the same experience and see the view of the city PLUS you can walk on the island and see the lake from different angles.

        "I was very excited for my first sailing experience and my first experience on vacation in Canada. I loved the boat and the views of the city. But I was disappointed that the motor was really what powered the boat the entire time, so never really got to experience SAILING - which is what it is billed as. It was also really annoying to not hear a word said by the young man on the microphone because none of the speakers were working and none of the crew bothered to explain or even acted troubled by that fact. The crew seemed nice, but interacted only at the beginning of the trip while still waiting to get sails up, and only to ask us what we wanted to eat. I think it is a great idea to use (what appears to be) college kids on the crew, but it would have been nice if, instead of clustering together in groups at either end of the ship looking bored and having their own personal conversations, they had made even a small effort to engage with passengers and possibly even ask if we had any questions or wanted them to point out some of the buildings downtown or things along the shore, etc. it just felt very much like we were sailing on an automated boat with no crew at all and no locals to interact with. I was a bit surprised to be honest. The views were wonderful and the ship is laid out well for passengers, but with one shanty sang before we left harbor, the crew was done with us. When I made the effort to speak to the manager directly, telling her I go out of my way to compliment great service but also like to provide feedback directly if it‚Äôs not so great (with no expectations on my part), all she said was: Thanks for sharing. No apology. No thanks for the great suggestions. Nothing."

From the quaint shops on Parliament & Carlton Streets, to the parks, Riverdale Farm, the Necropolis and some excellent restaurants — there is a lot to see and do. It’s very walkable and the houses are beautiful. You will notice plaques telling the stories of the famous residents or history of a building. Fun to explore the streets and see the examples of Edwardian & Victorian architecture."

Some wonderful restaurants of many cuisines, Dova, F'amelia, L'avenue, house on Parliament, kibo sushi, butterchicken factory to name a few. Anything you can think of within walking distance. The parks and Riverdale farm are excellent places to enjoy with kids and family. Highly recommend "

The main street was closed and turned into a festive pedestrian mall, where the different restaurants on the street set up dining areas. And great, free music of all kinds was everywhere. Off of the main street there are many well-preserved Victorian homes and an urban farm with heritage breeds of animals, free admission. There's a beautiful old graveyard near the farm, one of the oldest in Canada. Enjoyed all the little laneways and plaques that honour famous people who lived in the houses. So walkable, but easy access to downtown Toronto by public transit.  "

        "Cabbagetown is a small gem of a community where pride of ownership is evident everywhere. This is a Toronto neighbourhood with a northern border of Bloor Street/St. James Cemetery and Dundas Street being the southern one. The Don River is the eastern limit, and it goes west to Sherbourne Street. Easily accessible from either College or Wellesley subway. The community was established in 1840 and was once the enclave of the working poor who toiled in the glue factory, tanneries and brick works along the Don River and grew the eponymous \"cabbages\" in their front lawns. The workers' \"cottages are still in existence on the back end of Wellesley Street. The real draw to the area is the unbroken streetscape of Victorian homes, built in 1880-1890 for the middle class who inhabited the area.  These homes were renovated in the 1970's and 80's as today's urban yuppies moved into the city. Now designated a heritage site, the area has warded off the developer's condos and maintained a genteel charm that reflects a living sense of history.. The area's fine representation of architectural and urban design styles surround visitors and residents with a sense of history and sense of locality. You can easily spend a morning walking through the streestcape under a canopy of century old trees. Other draws to the area include the Riverdale Zoo, Wellesley Park and two heritage cemeteries, the Necropolis and St James. The area also has had its share of famous residents and walking through the streets, you can spot heritage signs on designated homes. "

Every second house has delicate gingerbread trim and lovely terracotta brick--the most beautiful building material in my opinion. Nearby is Riverdale Farm with real pigs and sheep, plus the St. James necropolis, where many early citizens rest in Gothic splendour. A great summer's day walk."

Today the woorld has changed and it is an enclave  of the rich and testament as to why the next generation cant afford small houses pre world war one.

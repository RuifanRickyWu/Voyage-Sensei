Took no time at all to order it, did not upsell me, and I arranged for delivery which was not very expensive.  Upon delivery, Bella even helped me carry my other big kayak across to another rack and offered to help with other things.  I will go here again for other purchases."

I called back a few weeks later and he evidently had no recollection of our the agreement nor did he apologize! he basically indicated he did not have any time to do the work. I have no idea how this schmuck has stayed in business with that level grossly disgusting service!!  DO NOT TRUST him!"

I was greeted with a smile and confirmation as well as my receipt and I was on my way with my brand new kayak.. love this place and I will be returning."

        "I purchased a paddle board and paddle from The Complete Paddler some time ago and wrote this the day after but forgot to post it. Just wanted to share my experience at The Complete Paddler.",
        "I wanted to buy a paddle board as a gift but need it reasonably quickly. I called The Complete Paddler and the woman on the phone said they had 1 blow up board left and more were coming in a couple days.  I went in to take a look and the clerk (I believe it was Tyler) said they would be in in less than 2 weeks.  It was a time sensitive purchase (birthday gift) so I wanted to know for sure.  He said to find out I could call the supplier (Blu Wave).  I called and the company said they had shipped 2 boards the day before and it would only take a couple days.  I decided to buy the paddle board in advance to ensure I would have it. Now I needed a paddle but The Complete Paddler had none in stock that came in 3 pieces and would have to order them from Blu Wave.  I called Blu Wave back and they had them in stock but also had a cheaper one at 189 dollars.  I asked the owner Kelly McDowell about them and he recommended the 189 dollar paddle (a 3 piece adjustable carbon fibreglass paddle) but he would have to put in a special order the next day as they didnt stock that model.  I said sounds great and I paid for the board and paddle (1588 dollars) right then and left the store. I called Blue Wave back to tell them they would be getting an order from The Complete Paddler for that paddle and I needed it quickly. The Complete Paddler called 2 days later to say everything had arrived.  ",
        "I went to the store to get my items and the owner Kelly McDowell approached me.  I thought it was to thank me for the business and send me on my way.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  He told me I had created a very BIG problem for him and his company.  Yah, seems like a huge problem. I just paid for a board and paddle after being in the store only 30 min.  He told me I could of cost him alot of extra money in shipping costs.  Really..... the paddle come in 3 pieces and weighs 810 grams.  He told me if I ever wanted to buy anything in his store again I could never contact the supplier.  I wouldn't of had to contact anyone if his staff knew anything about the products they were selling.  He was very aggressive and I didn't like his tone or his accusations he was making as they were complete nonsense. So now I am really annoyed.  Guess what Kelly.... I don't ever want to buy anything from your store again.  You were not doing me a favour selling me a paddle and board.  I was a customer and should be talked to in an appropriate respectful way.  I could of just order the paddle board somewhere else.  I would avoid going to The Complete Paddler and would encourage others to do the same.  Kelly McDowell is rude and disrespectful. I am not sure how they stay in business.  By the way Kelly McDowell ordered several of the paddles I wanted and the same one he suggested.  WHAT A HUGE PROBLEM I CAUSED....."

      "text": [
        "Extremely negative experience. Purchased a kayak and roof rack back at the beginning of the summer, roof rack was installed by employees of The Complete Paddler. Fast forward to our first time using the kayak, driving along the highway, we hear a big whoosh and...no more roof rack or kayak. We were very fortunate that the kayak flew over 3 lanes of traffic without striking anyone and landed on the inside shoulder of the highway. Much to our surprise the roof rack was not installed correctly, we thought that by leaving it to the experts to hook it up we were doing the right thing. Unfortunately we ended up being left with a damaged kayak and useless roof rack in pieces in addition to lots of stress. When this was brought to the attention of management at The Complete Paddler, there was no apology and it seemed like they were more interested in deflecting blame onto the manufacturer of the roof rack (Thule). They offered to replace the roof rack and re-install it which we accepted, we set an appointment to have it reinstalled but due to a miscommunication ended up being there on the wrong day, we were told the owner would give us a call to reschedule the appointment to install the rack. That was 3 weeks ago, having not heard anything since, we stopped in unannounced this past Sunday and picked up the rack, we'll have it installed elsewhere. Ultimately the experience was negative, there was no ownership of the issue taken, no apology, no customer service, and seemingly no understanding of the consequences this situation could have had, both on us personally, but also on the business, had the rack and kayak caused accident or injury, frankly it's a miracle it didn't."

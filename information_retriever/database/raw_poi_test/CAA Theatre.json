        "Often we expect theatre - especially new works - to exaggerate for effect. Not Us/Them. Its impact comes from its subtlety. The actors play children and perfectly reveal the built-in defences children have against extreme conditions. Children do not explore the root causes or histories of events or look for meaning. They react spontaneously and morally without relying on theories, research or analysis to underpin their instinct. It undervalues children's resources to call these characters victims or survivors."

Well, I am very glad we attended Piaff/Dietrich.  The show was simply electrifying.  Both leads were astounding in several categories including acting and of course singing.  A totally convincing story of their relationship with a wonderful reprise of important songs of the era.  Perfect character development along with a compelling story led to a well-deserved standing ovation! ",

And there are dearth of good restaurants close by as well.  But this venue is more intimate than some others in the city and proved to be ideal for the production of Piaf/Dietrich in every way.  The play itself was outstanding with stellar performances from  all involved, particularly the two leading woman. They captured the nuances, mannerisms, emotions of both characters they were playing. The singing was amazing and Piaf, played by Louis Petrie was bang on in terms of her singing 'stances, hand movements, cadence, emotions and she held the end note of each number just as Piaf did. It was uncanny. . I was mesmerized by her performance. She personified 'la petite mome' perfectly. Her ability to show both the strength of Piaf's artistry, as well as her vulnerability especially as she succumbed to her addiction. Even her hands took on the visible demonstration of Piaf's decline. And not to be forgotten or minimized is the incredible performance of  Jane Lewis who played Dietrich. Her mannerisms, voice, inflections, and incredible costuming all lent credibility and depth to her portrayal  of this famous star.  The staging and efficient use of a rather small stage was unique and clever and lent a seamless air to the various transitions. The music chosen was spot on!  The closing number brought my husband and I to tears.  And the standing ovation was a testament to the fabulous performances."

        "We had pre-booked our Niagara Falls private car tour (for Mon 18th February) prior to visiting Toronto from the UK. Booking process was simple and confirmation was quick.",
        "Although an SUV had been confirmed as our transport, what actually turned up to take us on our tour was a stretch limo. This made our day trip even more special.",
        "Our driver (Naveed) was extremely accommodating and knowledgable providing â€˜tour guideâ€™ commentary and information throughout.",
        "Included in our Niagara trip was a winery visit and stop-off at Niagara on the Lake. The wine tasting was fabulous as was our host at the winery who was informative on the winemaking/tasting and happy to answer all our questions. Niagara on the Lake is beautiful and we could have spent more time there than was available during our tour.",
        "We had booked â€˜behind the fallsâ€™ as part of the tour but had forgotten to bring the ticket printout with us on the trip. This wasnâ€™t a problem, Naveed said heâ€™d sort it out and he did. ",
        "Many thanks again Naveed for a fabulous day trip. Our Niagara Falls limo trip is one we will remember."

        "We booked this tour through trip advisor and had an awesome experience. Our driver was Ralph and he was super cool.  We left on time at 8:10am and got to Niagara Falls around 10:30am and it was a very smooth ride.  I actually fell asleep on the bus ride there. :)  We chose not to do the cruise and didnâ€™t really need too because you can walk alongside and see the beautiful falls.  The falls on the Canada side are better than the US side. There are places to eat and shop if you want and to have about 3 hours to explore.  We also went to a winery, stop by the smallest chapel , neighborhood store anc the cutest town. It was a wonderful experience and so glad we did it. We got back to Toronto around 6:20pm and overall it was a great day and thanks Ralph for being an awesome driver and for giving us a cool history lesson."

        "Our driver, Roy, was great. He altered our agenda to fit the weather which was very misty when we got to Niagara. At his suggestion we did the walk behind Niagara first and by the time we came out it had cleared and we had a terrific trip on the Hornblower cruise. He was informative along the way and very attentive to our needs. Would recommend to anyone going to Niagara from Toronto."

We went in winter, therefore were offered the behind the falls option.  Not bad!  The falls themselves are spectacular.  A real bucket list day!"

        "Pick up was prompt, and bus driver was very friendly. All of the activities listed on the website happened and we had a couple of hours at the Falls, which was more than enough. I guess the \"guided tour\" part of the trip didn't live up to my expectations as i hadn't appreciated that our driver was the tour guide and that all of our observations would be from the bus. ",
        "Admittedly this is not the best season to visit the Falls as the hornblower cruise runs only from April, some of the observation points in the Journey Behind the Falls were frozen, and many of the shops on Niagara-on-the-lake were closed.",
        "Overall it was a good trip but I wonder how much money I would have saved if I'd just taken public transport to the Falls, as I have a feeling that the experience wouldn't have been hugely different."

        "I thought it was time to see Niagara Falls again, since I am sure some of the main areas must have changed in the over forty since since my last visit.",
        "I found Niagara Tours through the internet and since the daily rate was very reasonable (and they also picked me up and dropped me off from downtown Toronto) at no extra charge, I just couldn't not take the trip to the falls.",
        "The company was very prompt with the pickup and the vehicle that arrived was very new, clean and tidy.  The owner was actually doing the driving and was very pleasant and professionally dressed.",
        "When we arrived at their office, we paid for the tour and any extras that were selected and then used their bathrooms before the bus arrived.",
        "The bus was nicely air conditioned and seemed to be in good working order.",
        "The driver was again, professionally dressed and had a pleasant demeanor.",
        "We could select our own seats and wasn't long before we departed their office on our way to the first stop which was a winery for a complimentary tasting.",
        "We then went to an airport for those people on the bus that wanted to take a helicopter ride over the falls and then we headed to Niagara.",
        "We were given approximately 3 1/2 hours to walk around at our leisure sight seeing and taking pictures. We grabbed a quick lunch at the casino and even had a little time to try the one armed bandits.  (I did come out on top with a win when I left).",
        "It was time to get back on the bus and then we were taken around the falls with stops at the whirlpool view spot, and Niagara on the Lake.  We even stopped at the clock of flowers for more photo opportunities and then we got back on the bus for our ride back to Toronto. ",
        "I would definitely recommend this tour for anyone wanting to sit back, relax and leave the driving to someone else.  It was a great way to see all that the Niagara region has to offer in a day for a reasonable rate.  This tour is good for all ages and even those with walking issues as everything is at a good proximity to all attractions or the bus."

As a 260lb male, she skillfully used her techniques including massage and stretching to help work out the kinks. She was also able to pinpoint problem areas and spend extra time on my trouble spots. My wife saw Ploy who provided a very detailed massage and was able to help realign her body. This establishment offers high-quality massages on comfortable mats so therapists can fully work your body. I would highly recommend booking services here."

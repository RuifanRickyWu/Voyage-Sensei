See the coffee houses where Joni Mitchell and Gordon Lightfoot got their start or the speakeasy where Dan Aykroyd and John Belushi came up with the idea for the Blues Brothers, learn how the NBA got started in Toronto, and much more.",

        "I would highly recommend Black Lab Tours if you plan to do any guided sightseeing tours in Toronto or Niagara Falls. Gareth and Tomâ€™s historic renderings and Fabianâ€™s skillful drive on a 30 seater were very much appreciated. I agree with all the reviews preceding â€¦ a dismal, grey, rainy day was transformed into a fun, lively event shared by 19 people. Toronto Senior Social cub thanks you all for such a warm, personable adventure. We will definitely be back."

        "A gray near-winter December day for a Niagara outing didnâ€™t sound promising for our social club. That was, until Black Lab Tours of Toronto came into the picture. How could Gareth make a storied Canadian destroyer, nearly invisible and remote in the mist, decidedly interesting? Or narrate how Laura Secord was able to save the lives of British soldiers in 1812 after her early morning, long hike through rough country, and not just provide a name for good chocolate? How could Tom lead our group gamely through the cold to view the American fort just a short swim away from us? Because they were passionate about their topicsâ€”which differentiated their presentation from a typical tour guideâ€™s canned spiel. In their hands, we walked around Niagara-on-the-Lake, joining other tourists enjoying its many quaint shops, while carols wafted in the air. Needless to say, these further lubricated our club membersâ€™ prior friendliness with each other. Lunch was a hearty and delicious one at Table Rock restaurant at Niagara Falls. It obviously had to be capped by group pictures before the picture windows showcasing the nearby thundering falls. Cocooned in a comfortable coach, the couple of hours ride to and from Niagara was pleasant. Complementing our tour guidesâ€™ desire to provide enjoyment, however, was a realistic concern for our safety and security. Perhaps most indicative of their concern was of them frequently doing a head count unobtrusively, as shepherds of their flock. At the end of the day, though, what truly distinguished the outing  was the passion that both Gareth and Tom brought. That was what made even a gray December day shine."

        "Today I went on a tour to Niagara Falls and Niagara on the Lake with Black Lab Tours.  It was arranged through the Toronto Seniors Social Club.  It was a fantastic day!  The bus was clean and spacious, the driver Fabian was great and personable and our two guides, Gareth and Tom, were super knowledgeable and very entertaining.  While I have visited Niagara on the Lake many times in the past, I learned some new facts today on our walking tour.  On our way home they gave us a sample of ice syrup.  They explained how it was discovered by accident and how it is used in cooking.  I had never heard of it (ice wine, yes, but not ice syrup).  I would highly recommend this tour to anyone."

To start he was on time, and very accommodating he really wanted to make sure we got the most out of our time together as well as checking in to see if there were any goals that we wanted to accomplish during the tour.  He was friendly and made the trip interesting and fun, we like doing these types of tours in cities we have never been to.  It is a great way to learn about the history and culture of the place.  I would totally recommend these guys, Gareth is a great guy and we feel as if we now have an insiders feel for the city."

We LOVED the stories about Toronto's role in the Beatles as well as the connection with Saturday Night Live!  Still in awe over how much better Toronto is now that I know so much more about what makes it special."

        "I took this tour near the end of June. I was solo and there were 5 others on the tour. Led by an exceptional guide, Gareth, this tour proved to be an unforgettable experience that left me both enlightened and inspired by Toronto! Gareth was super knowledgeable and friendly! The stops we made allowed us to see some of Toronto's most famous landmarks and places (CN Tower, Hockey Hall of Fame, old and new city halls), but also took us to lesser-known places to discuss both funny and incredible/awe-inspiring stories of the people that lived here, worked here, or spent their youth here. I highly recommend this tour for anyone visiting Toronto. It is great for sightseeing and for learning new stories about the city. I recommend people come prepared with water and a sunhat on hot summer days!"

        "I was in Toronto for work over the July long weekend, and was wandering around the downtown when I ended up chatting with a guide from this company, Gareth. He mentioned he had a tour at 1:00 and I was able to join. I think theyâ€™re quite a new business and it was a small group of us, but the tour was phenomenal! Gareth was a great speakerâ€”entertaining, super knowledgeable, and funny. Iâ€™d heard from some friends whoâ€™ve visited Toronto that the city is kind of boring, so I donâ€™t know whether this company is telling different information, but I thought it was absolutely fascinating. I have been a hockey fan my entire life, and I had no idea that the story of how the NHL was founded was so funny. It was also very cool to see the old Second City theatre building (not the new one where you can still go see shows today), which was where so many stars from the â€˜70s got their startâ€”like my favourite Schittâ€™s Creek actors, Eugene Levy and Catherine Oâ€™Hara.",
        "You will leave the main tourist strip a little bit because some of the sites are off the main drag, but it was cool to get more of a local feel for the city. I have been on a few tours over the years, and this was absolutely one of the bestâ€”I would recommend the downtown/old town tour to anyone visiting Toronto. Thank you Gareth!"

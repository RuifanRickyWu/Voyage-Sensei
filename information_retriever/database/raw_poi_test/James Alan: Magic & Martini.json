This is a very intimate venue and the menu is scant.. so if you are hungry.. eat before going.. We ordered the cheese board and dip.. both were very good .. but small.  The show was very entertaining and James is most personable..he involves the audience in such a nice way.. I would see the show again .. in a heartbeat"

        "Intimate venue with a cool, swanky vibe. We really enjoyed the show, though I would suggest the humour was the better part of the night and the magic was just okay. We had higher expectations but enjoyed ourselves none-the less. Fabulous, though very expensive, drink menu. Food options are restricted to nibbles like cheese board, olives, etc. We had a charcuterie board which came without any cheese, jellies or mustard, so had to order a cheese board separately. Our Server was amazing and very attentive with our drinks. Ended up spending nearly $200 on top of the tickets and then had to go eat elsewhere, so a pretty expensive night overall. There is definitely room for improvement with both the food and the magic, but overall still a fun few hours in a unique setting."

Seeing magic on TV and rolling your eyes at the editing is one thing, but being a couple of feet away watching James vanish cons in front of your eyes was insane! ",

The lighting, and ambience was comfortable and classy.",

It was an awesome show and the crowd was the perfect size so it really felt like a personal show. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a fun night out with a friend or even more perfect for a date night! Will be back!"

I really didn't expect an open bar type event, but given the title of the show we assumed it was the package deal!  At the very least, for show night, they should have offer a set menu of Martini's at a special show rate. ",

Once it warmed up we were able to take off our jackets and truly settle in for 75mins of carefree fun.",

        "Dinner was disappointing. We waited 20 minutes for some red wine because they didn't have any and had to send someone out to buy a few bottles. Although the salad and brushetta were tasty, the main course was bland. We were told the curried chicken was on the mild side so we opted for the sweet and spicy pork. The green beans were good but the pork and rice had absolutely no flavour. When we asked for some more red wine we were told there wasn't any left. The kitchen could use a little magic! Also, dining while watching a magic show can be a bit distracting."

The club kept the door open downstairs and upstairs and we had the table next to the door. I was freezing. My toes were numb while sitting in side! You can also see the toilet from the stage. The place is an absolute dump. It's also cash only which was written nowhere and when we told the waitress, who was VERY kind at first, that we only had credit....whoa! What a different person she became. The magic was juvenile and predictable. Jenny and Steves guessing game (mind reading if you will...) was not wow as it was assumed that they spoke in code to tell each other what the item was. All in all a very disappointing night. What we thought was a great deal turned out to be the biiiiiggest waste of money!"

A typical evening begins with host James Alan delighting what is often a sold out house with his blend of urbane wit and sophisticated magic followed by the featured guest Magician.  The guest Magician when I was last there earlier this month was Nick Wallace, a fabulous talent, whose theatrical performance \"Seance\" opens at Theatre Passe Muraille later this month.  If James is involved I know the magic will be good.  What came as a pleasant surprise, is that for an intimate club the food is quite delicious and the service good. It's a great evening out of Good Food, Good Fun, Laughter, Magic and Mystery."

The service was great, very friendly staff and the food was good but the star of the night was the show. That night there were two magicians (James Allan and Nick Wallace) performing for about 30 minutes each. Without giving to much away you have to see it for yourself but they had the whole audience laughing and gasping in amazement.  Must see live entertainment!"

James Alan definitely knows how to put on a marvelous and hilarious show and his special guest, Nick Wallace, wowed everyone in the audience with his spooky mysteries. Both of the acts had quite a few volunteers help them out on stage, so you definitely have to be comfortable with a little audience participation. The atmosphere was very cozy and I was impressed by the food, ideal for a date. Highly recommend the dinner and a show combo. My date and I both said to each other after the show that we should make this show a regular thing. Definitely coming back!"

        "Saw this show at The Crimson Lounge in The Cage 292 on College.  There were two magicians (James & Nick) that each performed for about 20-30 minutes.  The only way to describe it is that it is like YukYuks but instead of comedy you are seeing magic.  The performers themselves were really good and everything you would expect; charming, interactive, and amazing.  When we went the show was sold out with about adults 100 in a pretty small space but it made for a great atmosphere and show.  There were audible collective gasps from the audience at several times in the evening.  If you want to see magic acts well done this is the place to see it in Toronto.  I'm pretty sure there are different acts there each week."

In general, each show features performances by one or two headliners with some additional magic performed by the host, James Alan. The quality of the show, of course, depends on the magicians performing that evening. On the whole, though, the roster features some excellent talent and we've enjoyed most of the performers we've seen. ",

What you should expect to see at any given performance is two or three talented professionals doing slight of hand that, on a good night, will leave you wondering how what you saw was accomplished."

        "I have heard about James Alan's magic Caberet in Toronto from many colleagues in the magic circle for sometime, and finally got around to attend the show on Chinese New Year's as I wanted something different to help me ring in the Year of the Monkey other than the traditional dumpling feast with lion dances... When I first arrived, the entrance to the place had an underwhelming effect to the point that I almost doubted if I came to the right place. But after walking through a narrow hall way adorned with some random furniture in the style of an unattended storage room, I was pleasantly surprised to discover a cosy little space set up with small tables lit by candle light and a modest size stage with a vaudevillesque speak-easy vibe. The waitress had an attractive smile and personality that might have caused my date to feel a bit of jealousy and the house wine was served with such efficiency that by the time the show began, I was already smiling at everything. James Alan was dressed in a suit and tie and spoke eloquently and seriously about the subject of lunacy to some very well designed comical effect. His opening trick involving a hundred dollar bet with a random member of the audience who he claimed was psychic was very smoothly executed. The coin routine which followed was well paced and demonstrated some crafty sleight of hand, then he introduced Chris Westfall to the stage and the show suddenly shifted gear from elegant and mysterious to intensely comically surreal! Chris Westfall did not wear a suit and a tie, his jeans and sneakers plus baseball cap worn backwards communicated a sense of casual hip to the crowd that contrasted sharply to James Alan's business formal persona. Chris' nonchalant delivery and off beat jokes brought a good amount of laughter to the room, after a series of tricks that packed a good bundle of humour, he proceeded to destroy my sense of logic with a routine involving 7 random audience members on stage and a prediction held by a blind-folded volunteer. It was the most baffling card trick I've seen this year... Being the year of the Monkey, which symbolizes intelligence and innovation, I'm very happy to have begun my lunar new year with such a magical experience.",
        "I will not comment on the food in detail as my dining experience was completely overwhelmed by the magic show, but if I had to give a score from 1-10 on the evening, I would give it an \"8\", with 6.6 points going to the magic and the remaining going to the chef after allocating 1 point to the wine. ",
        "The wait staff was very pleasant and good natured as well as both the performers were very friendly and easy going and I was able to take a picture with them after the show to capture the memory of the most baffling card trick of the night which kept me up all night!"

It did not take long for me to realize that the entire show is run by passion which creates a positive and warm environment.",

        "Although I have not personally purchased a meal yet, it is a great option for this kind of event, making James Alan's Magic Tonight the perfect Sunday night activity for the family."

The manager ignored our complaints and no apology was evident.  The food was not well prepared but the second half of the magic show was entertaining.  I would not recommend this place to anyone."

He is so personable and great at remembering names.  I cannot wait to go to another show.  I guarantee you will have a great time if you see him!"

I was given tickets to his show as a gift and then needed to bring friends to see this guy. It's a top notch show of comedy and magic with new guest performers added to each event. So if you think you can limit yourself to just one show, need to see them all! How do these guys do it?! It's mind blowing! It's a fun night out with friends for food, drinks, magic and laughs. And I've even taken a date...or two. If the person I'm out with turns out to not like magic or this show, then I figure there's no point in continuing with the relationship."

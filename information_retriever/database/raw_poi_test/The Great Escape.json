        "The place is definitely not good. We have been to the Thai prison escape last week, and we were deeply disappointed. A few times we had to call for help as we were not able to open the lock with the correct answer because there was no indication on the lock on how to align the numbers. The manager was supposed to go through this with us before the game, but she did not do this. Her excuse was that there were a few groups starting at he same time, and she just did not have enough time to brief us. Also, one time giving us help she said that she would not be available for us in case we need her in the next 10 min as she will be busy with another team. I am not aware of why she has noone else to help or brief players, provided they got paid by both teams. We wasted half of the time in the beginning with those few locks and her being unavailable and the whole fun was killed by the frustration. When we told her about this, she behaved very arrogantly and aggressive like we were unhappy for no reason.",
        "The game itself is illogical to the extent that sometimes you need to input POTS when the correct answer is STOP (the other direction). There are three rooms and you need to go back and forth and you never know what code is for which lock - when you find a code you literally go and try it on all the available locks (without knowing how to align the answer on the lock, so virtually checking all possible combinations). This eats all your time and gives lots of frustration. ",

        "Went here last week with my husband and 18 yrs old son.  First of all the props and rooms are quite cheaply made.  We've done a few escape rooms before, so had some idea on how they work and what to expect, while understanding that each Escape room is different. However,  the Harry Potter room had no flow to the game, there were too many red herrings that weren't necessarily as the puzzles were complex enough. The \"locked\" door to the second room needed a code to unlock it however my son just turned the handle and it opened on it's own.  In my opinion the puzzle should start off fairly easy and then gradually get more challenging.   It's really frustrating when you can't even find the first clue and need to ask for help. The second one we did was the hangover and that wasn't much better some of the clues were very random and had absolutely nothing to do with the hangover theme I also think you need more than three players per room maybe to help with some of the puzzles all in all I would not recommend this place and definitely enjoyed the Imaginarium Escape room much better."

        "My experience at The Great Escape Canada was very bad from the second we walked in. We did the Harry Potter room at 9 pm on a Saturday night and you could tell the hostess did not want to be there. She clearly wanted to just go home, telling all of us that \"we are her last group and would like to get it over with\" and rushed us in the room. There were 13 of us in our group and she put us all into the same room (normally escape rooms would split big groups into 2 to compete) and I know they have more than one harry potter room to do this. The hostess basically threw all 13 of us in the room, gave us very minimal explaining, and just left. The puzzles were terrible and some of them didn't make any sense to 13 people trying to figure out one room. The Harry Potter \"theme\" was bad and cheap, having random printed off pictures of the characters. The door leading to the second room was just unlocked without doing anything! Whats the point of an escape room or solving puzzles if that's the case? I will not be going back to this escape room and I was very disappointed by our experience there. Highly recommend not going here."

I have heard of these previously and have always wanted to try one so why not do something new on vacation? If you ever enjoyed playing games like clue as a kid you will love this attraction. It really feels and plays like a lifelike board game, but instead of playing against your friends you have to learn how to work together to find your way out. My friends and I took on \"The Da Vinci Code\" game, which was explained to us by their very friendly staff as being the hardest game at the time. They also explained that they actually put in a lot of research before creating these games and will change them up from time to time. The game actually ended up being a bit more difficult than we thought it would be and I highly recommend bringing plenty of smart friends with you as the two friends I was with were not able to get us out of the rooms in time. We had a lot of fun though and time flew by extremely fast trying to figure out all the clues. Give it a try(I plan on doing more of these now), I'm sure you won't be disappointed!"

It's filled with books, maps, and other irrelevant stuff that make you search for nothing. Even a note you get from a locked box has misleading information, which we found out later that it's just a prop. Yes there are clues but no one could have figured it out among five hundred other red herrings, and black light shouldn't be put in this kind of room since it'll take forever to shine it on every single object. You never know if that black light is needed for one puzzle, so you are going to shine it on everything twice. That's two times forever long. Is it fun? I call that frustrating. ",

Unfortunately, the surprise was ruined by staff forgetting to leave a kettle in the room which got us stuck in the second room.

We just heard the door opening and when we got there we saw the door closing and noticed the kettle by the door. The staff claimed that the kettle was in the room under the table where the laptop is, which given how big the item is and how often four of us were there and looked all around the table, a ridiculous claim. I did not want to argue on the spot in order to not further ruin my son’s experience. However, I was really disappointed with this approach. Mistakes can happen but lying about it and putting a blame on a customer is not something that I can appreciate. I am very disappointed.",
        "Aside from the above described, solving these challenges is an interesting experience."

        "We were going to buy from Groupon, but I called to find out availability and they offered us the groupon rate directly, so we booked for the next day in the DaVinci Code escape room. We arrived, completed the waiver, and were briefed. The lecture about not moving props and paying for anything that broke was a bit much considering how cheap most of the “goodwill store” props were, and how much moving of props was necessary to find the clues. We called for a hint about 15 mins in and nobody came, so after trying multiple times over 10 mins, we went out and found them in the next room. They gave us 10 mins credit for that delay, which was fine. Then we kept going and found all clues in the first room, but could not find the key to the next room. Wasted another 15 mins trying to find it. We called for another hint and were told that we had lost the key...but they would open the door for us and give us 10 more minutes. 2 mins into the new room I found the key to open THAT room. It was on the other side of the locked door all along. A new employee had messed up the set up. At that point they offered us unlimited free hints because the next party had arrived. We were so fed up by that point, we got through most of the second room then had to leave. Given their lack of organization, I think we should have been offered a free repeat visit. It was a waste of time, bad customer service, and I would not recommend it, even with the groupon deal. Very disappointing!"

I found that the clues could have used better writing and more structure. I found it a bit chaotic as the sequence was a bit out of place. Nevertheless it was fun and with some hints from the staff we were able to escape with a couple of minutes to spare. Free parking on the street, staff friendly, washroom on site. Got a deal on groupon."

The rooms weren't horrible but weren't great either! Most of the time you were going through things and unlocking 'clues' that didn't lead anywhere. There's a difference between a trick and a total waste of time that they haven't quite figured out. Seemed 'okay' for my first time escape room adventure but trust me, there are better places!"

Nowhere in the groupon website or the groupon confirmation itself was it mentioned there were restrictions on dates or additional services. When we tried booking our visit, they came up with restrictions on days (weekends only), I couldn't reserve the party room either (any of these options were available for a hefty $100 fee). They didn't gave us any options, so we had to cancel our party and look for something else to do."

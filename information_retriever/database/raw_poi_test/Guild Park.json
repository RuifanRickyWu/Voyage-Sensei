  "description": "A unique 88-acre (36-hectare) public park where art meets nature. Located atop the Scarborough Bluffs, Guild Park includes formal gardens, forest areas and architectural fragments preserved from notable - and now demolished - buildings. Landmarks include the Greek Theatre, created from the marble arches of the 1912 Bank of Toronto; the facade of the 1895 Temple Building, once the tallest structure in the Britsh Empire, and public artwork, including sculptures by E. B. Cox, Sorel Etrog, Emmanuel Hahn, Frances Loring and Florence Wyle. Guild Park is operated by the City of Toronto and open 24/7, year- round. Check Guild Park's website for park events and activities.",

The grounds are well maintained with lots of flowers, sculptures and relics saved from demolitions. Lots of history. And there’s trails leading off along the bluffs. It’s great to visit when the flowers are in bloom."

It is also home to the Guild Inn Estate, where you book events and rent it out as a banquet facility. We spent the day exploring the water and were looking for somewhere to take a nice walk just before we left the area. This park is connected to other parks and trails along the Scarborough Bluffs. It's good for groups, families, couples, bike riding and the solo traveller. If you're ever in the area check it out yourself."

        "Thanks to conservationists and philanthropists - Rosa and Spencer Clark - for leaving us this beautiful legacy of stone fragments and pieces of architecture which would have otherwise been demolished. I was lucky to go there on a beautiful Fall day and it was just spectacular. I enjoyed reading the bits of information about the pieces displayed and marvelled at the intricate craft by stone makers and others to create the pieces which would been doomed for demolition. In a world of glass and straight lines, these are indeed artifacts. Later, a kind Scarborough native guided us to a trail to get to the shoreline of Lake Ontario and also to see a few glimpses of the Bluffs. A wonderful outing."

It is now in the midst of some sort of major redevelopment, which I am assuming is not anything more sinister than park improvements.  The formerly glorious Guildwood Inn & tearoom, which is located on the park property has been closed and boarded up for several years.  The statuary and archways scattered about the property remain, and are still popular with wedding photographers.  Written warnings and fencing abound, reminding one of the imminent dangers posed by the bluffs and the lake below.  It is not possibly to appreciate the beauty of the bluffs because they are not visible from Guild Park.  There is limited parking; at that, one section is blocked off, presumably to do with the construction.  There remain some pretty flower beds.  Guild Park, at present, is not worth the trek across the city.  It might provide respite for those in the vicinity who'd otherwise not have access to fresh air on a hot 'n' humid Toronto day. "

It is a favourite photo location for weddings,  Too bad the Inn is closed as there is no place to get food or use a toilet. At least parking is free and there are benches to sit on and paths by the lake, high up overlooking the bluffs. Trees block most of the view though."

        "Five Seniors, four using canes attended brunch last weekend and found the buildings and amenities challenging. The disabled parking closest to the entrance had a transport truck parked across them. One entrance was blocked by construction equipment. The electronic buttons to open the doors for the disabled did not function. The venue was moved to another room, Ballroom C which is at the back of the building requiring a long walk to get to. The only washroom available to all patrons in this room which could hold probably over 100 guests but was only one-quarter full was a single stall washroom for all. It did not have a space to change a child. It had no paper towels to wipe your hands with after washing. It lacked an air dryer. There was a line-up to gain access to it. I was told later there were more washrooms down a flight of stairs accessed from the front of the building. The service staff knew little about the brunch food offerings and the food staff knew little about our service. All staff were polite and courteous. The food warming containers slammed shut after every use startling guests. The food was decent but not special but then the price of the brunch reflected this. The sidewalk outside had few lowered curb areas for guests using walkers or wheelchairs requiring them to go a distance out of their way to avoid the step at the curb. Not all exits it appeared had ramps only stairs. I found the space to not be well designed to meet the needs of their mobility challenged guests. The building itself looks well built but the amenities to meet the number and types of guests they expect are in short supply."

Fortunately, the good folks who originally owned the Inn here sought to preserve some pieces and set up what is one of the few neo-classical sculpture gardens in the world. Wonderful place for a picnic or stroll along the bluffs. The city has never known what to do with this space which has incredible potential but it's a fav with wedding photographers."

        "I love this place!! I've always wanted to check this place out and when i finally did, I was amazed! This place is just beautiful. It may be small, but it is definitely a place so perfect for a walk with your partner. There was a boardwalk in the woods which you can enter in from the street and takes you to the main attraction, which is the columns. It was quite there and relaxing to walk. It's nice to explore this little park here and the surrounding places. There was a also a small peak there where you can see the lake and this beautiful horizon ahead. Overall, I loved it here and would definitely come back again!!"

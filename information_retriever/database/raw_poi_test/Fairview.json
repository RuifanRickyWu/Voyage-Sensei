        "My kids are not shoppers; yet, this is the mall in the central part of Toronto, where I can satisfy everybody. It’s not quite as upscale as Yorkdale...and is bigger than the Promenade or pricey Bayview Village. Past the LEGO store on the opposite side of the mall from TTC (“Don Mills”) subway station on Sheppard line, there’s a bustling food court. The Apple store is on the level above its Starbucks & McDonalds, where teenagers and senior citizens tend to congregate. I meet friends beside the South mall exit (outside Michel’s Baguette) at modern Heart Sushi to munch, while sending my kids to watch a movie with prepurchased tickets; the Shoppers Drug Mart beside the theatre, at the rear of the mall, has a post office inside to mail parcels, too. When I was a nursing mother, I used to go to the Mother’s Room inside the Bay department store. There’s seating available to wait for people near the Information kiosk in the centre of the mall (by Pandora jewellery), and also, at brightly-lit Aroma Cafe in the lower concourse. Fairview is busy, any day of the week, because of the transit station and also its ideal situation: where highways 401 and 404/DVP meet. However, it doesn’t have the tourist flow due to hotels that Yorkdale mall and Sherway get. It’s not hard for people from polar ends of the GTA to meet at Fairview...not a bad way to spend the day, even in bad weather!"

        "Fairview is quite good by North American standards.  It has a good variety of high- and lower-end retail stores, except the bag stores at Yorkdale.  Most importantly, Fairview is accessible by road (at the junction of highways 404/DVP and 401) and by public transit (Sheppard-TTC Don Mills subway station).  There is no indoor passage connecting the subway exit to the mall. However, it has improved in terms of dining options, electronics (incl. Apple Store), and baby change stations with a couple home improvement and kids' wear options now.  What I have seen at malls such as BC's Oakridge Mall is a kids' indoor playground, which would be an added bonus in a Toronto mall of this size.  However, the Lego store attracts school-age kids.  Aside from the paucity of children's' shoe stores (save but Kiddie Kobbler), Fairview is a decent family shopping centre.  I recommend it to anyone who has two to four or five hours to expend."

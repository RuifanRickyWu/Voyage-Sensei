        "I came across GTA photography through an online search of photography courses in my area. I have to say this has been one of my best finds!  So far I have taken their Photography 101 and Portraiture class and will be taking Travel Photography next. I really like how the classes are small in size so you are able to get one-on-one assistance and ask questions. The instructors are friendly, knowledgeable and very forthcoming in giving tips, tricks and feedback. The group setting allows for the exchange of ideas which has opened the door to endless possibilities. What started as a mere interest in learning something new is now becoming a beautifully inspired craft. Thank you team GTA photography!"

        "My kids gave me the gift of a photography class at GTA Photography when I retired.  I chose the starter class, Photo 101, to learn more details about using my camera in manual mode.  This was a great class - I learned so much, I just hope I can retain all the knowledge!  Of course, practice, practice, practice will help.  The instructor, Alexandra, was just great - personable, ready to help, always able to answer questions, and a great teacher.  I loved that the class incorporated hands-on practice that also allowed for one-on-one with the instructor to work through the challenges.  Loved this class!"

The class are small which I really like not crowded, the environment of the rooms are inviting to learn and capture the beautiful images from your camera.  Now that I applied all the skills that I learn from them. I would say my hidden talent are really show off. I gain so much knowledge and confidence from myself to shoots more beautiful pictures. I can’t wait to take more workshop from gta photography."

        "My daughter took a private class at GTA photography. She loved the class, said she learned a lot, and was keen to take another one. It was a challenge however to actually book the private class. I wrote multiple emails, and phoned the administrative office multiple times. I was repeatedly told that they would get back to me the same day, next day, end of the week to confirm. Instead I had to reach out again to obtain any information. We had asked for two private classes, but in the end the poor administration led to us only taking one. This is really too bad, as the teacher was excellent!"

        "The welcome email was very informative with directions to get there, what to bring and wear, class schedule, class notes, cancellation policy etc. Whoever prepared it was very organized :)",
        "The only thing is at either class there was not enough time to practice. We were supposed to have a 2 hour shooting tour with Joanna, but it ended up only being ah hour. And same with Alex, it felt a little rushed and it was hard to relax and get in the zone.",
        "I strongly believe the instructors did their best, but maybe the course does not account for the time it takes to address student questions as we go. It's what seemed to have put us over the time limit.",
        "Overall, I think what I've learnt was very valuable and I am taking another class this coming weekend.",

She really went out of her way to make me feel comfortable and understand how photography works and all the various settings on my camera. I went from knowing nothing to being able to take quality photographs within 2 hours. I would highly recommend taking a lesson with her as she's super friendly, energetic and extremely knowledgable."

I thought the workshop was well run.  The topics covered were appropriate for traveling and Lauren spoke well, taking time to answer people’s questions, but also keeping the flow of the subject material.  I have learned some great tips that I will add to my photography next time I travel."

        "I've taken 3 different classes (Photo 201, Food & Street Photography) and workshops with GTA Photography and always walk away with new skills and techniques.  Class sizes are small and there are many opportunities to apply what you've learned through in-class practical application and homework which I appreciate. Each class gets you to learn more about and be comfortable with the manual settings on your camera which is great. Some of the biggest takeaways for me have been learning new creative photo techniques and learning how to deal with different lighting situations and challenges. Instructors are knowledgeable and approachable. Prices are competitive and reasonable."

She was happy to answer any and all questions regarding photography or even specifics of the different cameras we all brought to the class. I feel like I now know how to use the manual mode on my camera and how to take and compose some basic artistic shots."

Took time to answer all the questions we had and explained things in an easy format. Taking the class definitely improved my photography know how and also my ability to compose and critique a photo. Going to take the second half as well as some of the single day workshops that are geared to a specific topic like taking pics in low lighting, photo editing or travel photography"

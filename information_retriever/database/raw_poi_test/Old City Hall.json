The building appeared to be locked, but we pushed open a heavy door to discover that it was indeed open. There were strict security procedures in order to enter, as the building now operates as a court house - the largest and busiest in all of Canada. The magnificent interior with its mosaic floor, columns, gargoyles, old elevator shaft, caricatures of Councillors, staircase and stained glass window was well worth a visit."

The building was built in the late 1800s and is actually Toronto's third city hall and will hopefully be turned into a heritage museum to display Toronto's history. The bells in the tower have been tolling since the turn of the century, but just recently the hourly chime has stopped due to an issue detected during an inspection this past winter. The quarterly bells continue to chime. If you take the time to stroll around the exterior of the building you will be able to see several gargoyles as well as other architectural details that add to the charm and grandeur of the building. It is situated across from Nathan Phillips Square as well as the present City Hall so it is interesting to be able to see the contrast between the old classic structure and the newer futuristic one."

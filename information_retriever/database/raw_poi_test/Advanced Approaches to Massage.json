        "I went for a first time massage recently and although I will say that after a fairly awkward and somewhat bizarre initial exchange, Su did proceed to give me a massage.  At the outset, Su asked me what level of pressure I would like so I responded that I would like to try a \"medium\" pressure and go from there - not too hard, not too soft.  Unfortunately, for first 15 minutes, Su was only lightly caressing my back. As I lay there wondering when the ACTUAL massage would begin, I decided to delicately suggest \"Oh you can probably go a bit stronger.\"  Su immediately bristled and responded by saying \"Well, I'm renowned for my deep tissue work.\"  I, in turn, responded that I wasn't questioning her ability, I was simply asking her to massage a bit stronger.\"  Again, she seemed pretty annoyed with that request and mumbled something about how I had asked for \"medium.\"  I answered that again I wasn't trying to be difficult but that in my past massage experiences, massage therapists generally apply pressure and check in every so often to ensure if you want to go stronger or lighter (especially on the first visit!).  She proceeded to tell me that if I wanted it stronger, I had better be prepared for it to hurt a lot more. From there she started to dig in a bit and although there were points where it did hurt a bit, mostly it was tolerable.  That said, apart from the earlier hostility, she was really cold towards me throughout, very detached and very much came across as someone who just wanted to get out of there.  I think the overall takeaway here for anyone reading this is that in my humble opinion, a massage should be a RELAXING experience.  Certainly the actual massage itself should FEEL good but the whole overall vibe and energy in the room is so important too.  All of it contributes to the patron walking out feeling relaxed with all their mental and physical tension having melted away.  ",
        "When Su finished my massage she basically just told me I could get dressed and walked out of the room.  That was it, I never saw her again.  I got dressed, left the clinic and felt no better than when I first arrived.  If anything, I was even a bit wound up just because I couldn't believe I'd just spent $100.00 hard earned dollars on such an unpleasant experience.  ",
        "**A note about the cost.  I was asked to pay up front for the service which in 25 years of getting massages, I have never been asked to do.  When I questioned the receptionist about this upon arriving I was told \"We don't want you to have to think about money once you are feeling relaxed after your massage.\"  This was strange to me and also had me questioning afterwards if maybe they just get a lot of first timers who never come back so they just take the money and run (so to speak).  Additionally, outside of exclusive full service spas, I have also found most massages in clinics to range from $75.00 per hour to 90.00 per hour.  Su charges $100.00.  Again, had the massage and overall experience been a good one, I would've thought her expensive but would have swallowed the price without a peep.  After all, sometimes you do get what you pay for.  Not in this case though.  Not only is this too much money for a visit to Su, it's about 100.00 too much.  I won't go back here and I would not recommend it to anyone ever."

I work and live in Wales, and my work brings me to Toronto about once a year (usually a conference), and when I'm here, I call in for a massage with Su (or Emil).  Advanced Approaches to Massage has assembled a great team of talented massage therapists (registered, of course) and are now offering Acupuncture treatments as well (with newer staff members Chong Min or Lucy).  At $99/hr for massage (or $110 for acupuncture) the price is very reasonable, and the quality of treatment is superb.  \"A serene environment, focused on your well being\" … says it all!",

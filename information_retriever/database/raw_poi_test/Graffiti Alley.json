Graffiti Alley is the type of spot that gives a city their charm & uniqueness! Super unique & talented works of art to check out! Take your time & explore around- every nook & turn awaits with more art to see. We spent over a hour checking it all out, taking photos & soaking the local talent in!"

        "This is a big outdoor art space a couple of blocks long between Queen and Richmond. The graffiti itself is a pretty mixed bag. Some of it is very good and other stuff is not so good or just tagging material. However, I enjoyed it a lot and the good works are very good. I think it is also a popular filming area since a bunch of young men were shooting a video when I was there. I think it is a good place to go if you are generally in the area and are looking for something to do after other attractions are closed, such as the museums. I think I was there for about 45 mins and that was more than enough (partly because the guys filming slowed everyone down). A lot of people were also taking photos there."

        "Disappointing Experience at Hamman Spa on King St, Toronto",
        "My recent visit to Hamman Spa on King St in Toronto left me with mixed feelings and a sense of disappointment. The Receptionists were lovely and kind. But this spa, known for its luxurious treatments and upscale ambiance, came with a hefty price tag of over $700+ for three people. I treated 2 others for their birthdays. Unfortunately, two of us were left underwhelmed and unimpressed with both the facial and massage services, primarily due to the poor service and incessant upselling at the facial. She even said: \"Come back when you get your paycheck\" to my guest. What the actual....",
        "Upon arriving at the spa, we were greeted with a neutral vibe. However, neutral turned to underwhelming quickly as we proceeded with our treatments. The troubles began during my own massage where I asked for a deep pressure, hard massage and the masseuse told me to wait, I probably don't want that. Well, yes, I do, I know my body and have had countless previous massages in my lifetime. Perhaps she was tired that day and didn't want to exert herself to meet the $200+something price tag. I was really disappointed despite telling her what I wanted because I was in pain and craved relief after suffering with muscle tension for months of travel and planes. ",
        "My 2 other guests and I had different therapists, but all of us shared a common sentiment of not feeling satisfied with the quality of the services. The facials lacked the attention to detail and personalized care that one would expect from a premium spa. It was a \"Signature Facial\" we thought but nothing adjusted as per specific skin needs. The therapist appeared disinterested in anything but upselling, going through the motions without making an effort to customize the treatments according to our individual skin concerns. I kid you not, the therapist focused on upselling additional treatments and products to my guest ON HER BIRTHDAY rather than providing a genuinely soothing experience. The constant pressure to purchase expensive add-ons during the session detracted from the supposed tranquility of the environment.",
        "To add to our disappointment, the service throughout our visit was inconsistent and unprofessional. The spa staff seemed more interested in promoting their expensive packages and retail products than ensuring our comfort and satisfaction. This upselling approach was intrusive and created a sense of discomfort during what should have been a serene experience.",
        "The exorbitant price I paid for my guests would have been a pleasure to pay if both my guests on their birthday got good service and weren't harassed.  I expected a level of service and attention to detail that wasn't delivered but was easily delivered by the MANY spas I've visited around the world but a fifth of the price. While I understand that luxury comes with a price, it is essential for a spa of this caliber to prioritize customer satisfaction over financial gain.",
        "Our experience at Hamman Spa on King St was a letdown. The lackluster facials and massages (we found the same moisturizer used in the bathroom for free...), coupled with the pushy upselling tactics and unimpressive service, made this visit far from the experience we had anticipated. We left the spa feeling underwhelmed and regretful for having spent such a significant amount on a disappointing day. We will not be returning to this spa and cannot recommend it to others seeking a truly indulgent spa experience."

        "Came with old friend to unwind and arrived at the last minute because of an accident and traffic. Greeted as if we were wayward schoolchildren (the services we booked were several hundred dollars) and at no point was there a sense of welcome. The 'treatments' are a hodge-podge of wannabe eastern and other traditions; the space is clean but the techniques and products don't hold a candle to the tradition they stem from. Many details are shoddy- calling 4 times on the day or appointment for details and then to warn of potential tardines= no answer (lett 2 messages, and there were 3 receptionists).; flip flops all the same size without indication of where one can find larger or smaller ones, Men and women services are combined- this is the purported justification for the ridiculous 'disposable underwear'- when this more likely reflects the distaste expressed by some staff to gaze at naked bodies. after the mud application the ritual (taking shower) means your flip flops stay full of clay; little supplies in the changing room and low quality hair products for what there was....Bad muzak played loudly throughout.",

        "I convinced my girlfriends to book an appointment with me at Hammam Spa on September 30th for shellac manicures based on another friend's recommendation. The nail techs who completed our services were friendly and our experience was enjoyable while we were there. However, one of my friend's nails chipped ONE DAY after she got them done (see photos attached). I believe her nail tech rushed the service since she started after us, but finished at the same time. I reached out to the salon that week TWICE by email which included these photos, plus I left a phone message explaining the situation and simply asking for someone to get in touch with me but no one ever did! What terrible customer service!! They should at least have the decency to get back to me. They obviously do not stand behind their quality of work or care about paying customers. DO NOT BOOK at this salon, or else you risk ending up disappointed with your service with no one to even attempt to mend the situation. I will gladly give my business to other salons who actually have integrity."

I had the facial to follow and it was done by Khalisah, she has the most lovely personality, very informative and gave me not only an excellent facial but tips! I loved the products used as well.

Use of the steamroom is free with most treatments or you can pay a small fee to just use the steamroom. I go for the body treaments ( be sure to steam before body treatments, arrive early) they are all fantastic but I like the Baltic Wrap the best. Facials are also wonderful. For either treatment request Tanya she is amazing. A very tranquil and relaxing environment, a great way to spend an afternoon and escape the hustle and bustle of the city. A great place to re-charge if you had a few too many late nights in a row. You will leave feeling refreshed and energized. Highly recommend as is the perfect city retreat."

Perhaps that was the only attraction to this spa; for a spa in the luxury category, they need a LOT to be done to really capture that luxury spa feel. While the RMT service and steam room were excellent, the ambiance was lacking for a luxury category spa. My detailed reasons below:",
        "1. Overall ambiance, massage rooms, change rooms:",
        "I felt the place to be noisy and not tranquil at all. The seating/relaxation area is not too far away from the front desk and the back and forth of people in the change rooms. They do offer tea, water and some nuts, apples, and reading magazines, but the natural light coming in and the limited seating makes it feel more like a doctor’s office waiting room than a spa. Overall, not a place I would be choosing to spend the entire day at. ",
        "The massage rooms themselves are nicely decorated, but I would say the Moroccan theme can be channeled even more (especially when you compare to the Miraj Caudalie Hammam spa at the Shangri La). I also note one of the “exit” or back doors was scratched quite significantly (which took away from the luxury spa vibe and made me feel like I was in the stock room of a Metro).",
        "The change rooms were clean, but there was limited space to change (and only a few bathroom stalls). They do offer some amenities but I personally did not reach for any (and don’t recall anything particularly standing out).",
        "2. RMT massage:",
        "The massage itself was superb. I had a 90 minute Swedish massage and absolutely loved it. The RMT provided excellent service. The middle eastern themed music was also superb. You can, however, hear people talking outside.",
        "3. Steam room: ",
        "The steam room definitely was a highlight. I wish this exact steam room was offered at the Hammam Shangri La). It’s gorgeously lit, perfectly steamed, and they offer ice prior to you entering. It’s weird that they offer Turkish baths at the Moroccan spa; perhaps to keep the theme with Moroccan offerings, to offer Moroccan baths? Minor point, of course.",
        "Overall impression: while the steam room and RMT service were great, I personally wouldn’t pay $220 for that service again. I would much rather be able to spend a day at a spa and enjoy the amenities without feeling like I’m in a waiting area. 3/5!"

He is unparalleled in skill and I have always left feeling significantly better than when I walked in, I feel better in mind, spirit, and physically. I highly recommend Hammam and even more so recommend Sal if you are seeking a masseur with talent. I continue to book exclusively with Sal and will do so for the foreseeable future."

If you like deep tissue massage I wouldn't hesitate and book him.  I'm going to send my boyfriend for a massage from him and he'll be my go-to therapist from now on!   ",

        "I was downtown for my business meeting. I had been thinking of visiting a spa for the last 2 months but never got a chance to do so because of my restrained time and tight schedule. I decided to try one of the close-by spas since I had my afternoon off that day. I walked into Hammam Spa after lunch and got an appointment for a massage late afternoon same day. Very friendly Jennifer at the front desk mentioned that I can either go to steam room or relax while enjoying their free snack and juice bar located in the waiting room. I changed into their fabulous Turkish wrap and a gown and went to their waiting room to chill. ",
        "I am someone who is extremely sensitive to sound and light. This spa is located on the ground floor. Their wooden ceiling at the waiting room was squeaking and creaking. I could hear people walking and talking upstairs. It was bothering me.  I started regretting my choice of spa. Normally I walk out of the place in these situations but I decided to head to their steam room instead. ",
        "Wallah! My mood changed immediately. Everything except waiting room is sound proof. It was just superb bliss. The ambiance of their steam room is simply amazing. It's not a regular steam room. It is one of those colorful decorated rooms we see in Turkish movies, not that I have ever watched a Turkish movie . :) ",
        "My massage therapy was incredibly amazing as well. Anna did some kind of massage on my facial pressure points during the therapy. I immediately felt like I was in heaven. She is well experienced and trained in massage therapy. ",
        "My only advice to this spa is to fix their waiting room's wooden ceiling and make it soundproof. They've invested so much money, great service, staff and ambiance that this waiting room doesn't do any justice to the property. ",
        "Everything else was simply awesome. Definitely coming back!"

You get a locker and in there is a robe and a Hammam towel for you to wear in the spa.  They also have flip flops in various sizes (small, medium, large) for your use while in the spa.",

You cannot see much which is nice if you are a bit shy as you are in there with the hammam towel.  There are water basins if you want to splash some water in the steam room and outside it has water available to drink and cool towels that have eucalyptus infused for your face.  It was so wonderful just to sit in there and enjoy the steam!  I visited the room 3 times during my hour prior to my treatment.",

        "The tea room is supposed to be quiet.  They have tea (which I need to find out the type of tea as it was yummy), cranberry juice and water.  Some apples and nuts.  There are magazines and colouring pages with crayons to de-stress and unplug.  It was nice just sitting there having a glass of tea.  There is some background music in the background that I would say would either be a mix of Turkish or East Indian.  ",

You are taking to one of the Hammam rooms and there is a heated marble table that you lie down on wearing a disposable thong.  Michelle scrubbed me with the hammam mitt and some black Moroccan soap.  Little pills of dirt and dead skin along with the soap were coming off.  She then splashed me with warm bowls of water to wash me off.   It was an awesome experience!  When I dried off and put my robe on, there was some tea and a small plate of a petite Turkish delight and baklava waiting for me to nosh on.   ",

        "Usually, with massages, if you have a knot or some sore spot, a lot of therapists will cause a bit of soreness during treatment or you will feel sore after treatment to get the knot out.  I never experienced that with Toby! His expertise and remarkable personality gave me the best massage I have ever had!",
        "All in all, I would say that I loved my time that I spent at Hammam Spa (I really need to pickup a Hammam scarf and what was the tea flavor again?!?).  I recommend it highly.  Parking is an issue (it’s Toronto) but I found something within 2 blocks.  It is a bit on the pricy side but as a treat for Mother’s Day or birthday, anniversary, etc. I say book it!"

        "I've been to the Hammam spa a few times and like how my husband and I can go in the large steam room together so we decided to go in honour of his birthday.  The spa is really dark and has long halls so I had to wear my glasses to the Turkish steam room to find my way.  There was no where to put them so I had no choice but to put them in my robe pocket and figured I would keep them safe by putting my robe under my husbands.  Well... when I came out my robe was gone but my husbands wasn't.  Another guest took it from underneath and then went to her treatment.  The front desk staff, Nicolas didn't seem as concerned for me as he did for the guest who took my robe.  He considered it my fault for not leaving my glasses in my locker.  She had a double spa treatment and they refused to ask her if she had my glasses between treatments so I had to wait 2 hours for her to be finished.  Needless to say it ruined my experience because I was anxious not knowing exactly where they were and also had to wait so I couldn't relax. To make matters worse when the woman's treatment was finished they did not approach her and ask if she had them.  I had to wait in the waiting area for her and actually call out and ask her if she had them when she was walking into the change room.  If the staff had been there to do this for me then I would not have had to speak with her which is the way one would have expected it to be handled. They were so unprofessional and I expected more from a spa that fancy's themselves as high end. The part that upset me the most was that the staff only valued her experience and not mine when she took my robe. I followed up by calling Giovanna (assistant manager) and it took a few tries of calling and emailing before I got her. She wasn't proactive in wanting to know what happened.  Then I felt like it was lame lip service to apologize.  This is not a high end spa and based on how I was treated I will not go back..... and this is secondary to my experience but the massage wasn't good and was a weird technique.  She used her arm rather than her fingers to massage my back."

I won't spoil too much but my skin felt smooth as a newborn baby when I emerged from the bubbly cocoon and I got goosebumps as the hot water washed away all my worries.",

She sensed that so did not engage in idle chit chat. That is a very important quality to have, to sense what your client wants. I would rate my service with her a 10 out of 10. My friend, on the other hand had a different esthetician and said it was her worst facial ever and they cancelled her hair treatment add on without discussion or offering another treatment. Unfortunately she did not raise her concerns with management. So my experience was amazing while her's was not. So to ensure a great experience  ask for Anna."

        "Planned a spa day for a group of four friends. Had a mixture of massages, a manicure and a pedicure. We arrived early and had a tour of the facilities and received instructions on the steam room. Unfortunately, the instructions were to wear a Turkish wrap (they provided) in the steam room. After a great steam we needed to rinse off using the showers next to the steam room. Although the sign said that the temperature could be adjusted, once inside there was once temperature - ICE COLD. We put it down to hot/cold Nordic spa treatment. The advice to wear the wrap in the steam room is wrong, swap it for a towel (which are stocked) that way you don’t sit around in a damp wrap under your robe afterwards. Following we had our various treatments and the massages and treatments were good. We three of us returned for a couple more steams, it was after the third steam when we were rinsing off, did we realize it wasn’t a hot/cold treatment, we actually had a little bit of warm water, so our freezing experience was just them out of hot water. We had to shower off the oil from our massages before we left, so back in the change room after lathering up with soap and the hint of hot water, after about 60 seconds it returned to an ICE COLD shower. Pretty much the opposite of relaxing. Pretty poor to be that short on hot water. The price of our visit would easily cover another hot water tank. "

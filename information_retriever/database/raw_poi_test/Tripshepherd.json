        "Our tour of Toronto started with a visit to the imposing CN Tower – we went up to BOTH observation decks! – then to the sprawling indoor St. Lawrence Market & Food Court – best Reuben sandwich I ever had! (And I lived in NYC!) – then to the underground PATH (cited by Guinness Records as the largest underground shopping mall in the world), and at every opportunity, we drove around several historic buildings (including the State House and Mayor’s Office). Our tour guide Ehsaan had tremendous knowledge about Toronto’s history, culture, and multi-cultural heritage – he had lots of stories about each place we visited. He was also very personable and always very responsive to our questions – an outstanding tour guide! We highly recommend this tour of Toronto –especially with tour guide like Ehsaan."

        "Had best time on this tour.  Early pickup from hotel lobby meant early arrival in Niagara Falls.  Fancy but smaller tourist van meant we were comfortable, could actually interact with the guide and other guests.  We basically had 'skip the line' access to Behind the Falls, the Skylon Tower and Boat Ride - - amazing.  It was a beautiful day, so all our pictures are gorgeous.  Behind The Falls was such a special treat and angle to view the falls.  The Skylon Tower had spectacular views of the entire falls area.  And the Boat Ride was unexpectedly 'up close' and 'wet'.  I knew we would get misted on - but it was super watery and hard to keep eyes open as we rode into the circle of the falls.  It was everything.  This was our first visit to Niagara Falls and this tour really hit every highlight.  We also had some free time to walk around/catch lunch.  Our tour guide, Ryan,  was super knowledgeable and provided great tips to ensure we experienced everything we wanted to during our visit.  Highly recommend this tour - and Trip Shepherd in general.  We also took other smaller tours with them in Toronto - and they were terrific.  Merci from Maryland, USA"

He told us all about the city and guided us through the CN tower and a Harbor Boat cruise.  It was a beautiful day and we enjoyed the walking.  Since we were parked closest to the Harbor area we did skip the end of the tour to avoid a longer walk to our car and wanted to get back out of a busy downtown area.  I would highly recommend this tour and you’re lucky to have Daniel as a guide!"

Tour guide Ben was so knowledgeable and very accommodating just like everyone I encountered from TripSheperd tours on TripAdvisor. You knew what to expect and they communicate effectively well. I had a lot of fun touring the city and seeing it from the daytime perspective and got to go on a Harbour cruise at the end which was so nice and relaxing. The views wete amazing and the other guests I met were all nice too. I had such a great time that I highly recommend these tours to anyone!"

It was a perfect night to end my night when I had a full day of tour before then but I wasn’t tired at all because the entire tour was very fun! I saw a lot of the great spots Toronto has to offer from a night perspective like the beautiful views of CN Tower! They also pick you up at the downtown hotel you stay at and it was very convenient & they communicate with you so well! I highly recommend this and I would actually go on this tour again even if I already experienced it! It is nice to have the guided tour but feel like you can explore the spots on your own at the same time."

The CN tower, market visit and Harbour trip all went smoothly and were most enjoyable. The latter having a witty guide on board.

Tripshepard was the perfect choice and Amar, our tour guide, prepared a perfect day!

From there we went to the harbor where we took a great harbor cruise for an hour. The views were great and the guide did a fantastic job.

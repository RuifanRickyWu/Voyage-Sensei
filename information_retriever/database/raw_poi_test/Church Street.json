The big fancy Loblaws is on this strip.  Interesting architecture nicely preserved.  Nice thing is families, singles, Gays, straights all live side in (mostly) harmony.  The street is hopping during the week of Pride, late June.  Closed to vehicle traffic, the hood becomes a party zone, attracting visitors from all over the world.

      "text": [
        "In late May 2015 I walked slowly from Younge and Bloor to Church Street and discovered several additions to the urban landscape. I had been there before especially to visit the Italian national tourist office once located in the red building near Bloor and Church. Somebody authorized the construction of a huge humongous extra tall tower of a building of a condominiums and what-have-you at Younge Street. ThIs project brings ugliness to the urban landscape again in the form of more expensive living spaced for people who want go to be downtown. Several older smaller buildings have been removed like the Green Mango to make too for this monstrosity of a building. If this is beautification for the city I question your wisdom for allowing this to happen. I think it is more like greed for developers. Now I found many visits ago too Church Street a red like building with an unusual shape and configuration near Hayden Street and Church very close to Bloor. In fact it is on Bloor but facing in a awkward direction away from having its front entrance on Bloor. Its color has been a rusty cherry like version of red and I like it very much. I have sat inside on the first floor or lobby looking outside admiring the interior design of the building. The exterior design is what brings me here. It sits in a way that makes me think that somebody misallocated the references for having the building face Bloor square ahead. It seems to out of position like when nobody was looking it moved itself around to a different angle for facing Bloor. This structure is among my favorite large buildings in this city. I have walked or travelled along Church southward in the direction of the Maitland area to find a central YMCA and several parts of ethnic neighborhoods not exceedingly large but there they were to see. This area is so different from what can be seen near Young and Bloor and Church. But it is the large tall red building on Bloor that brings me back to this corner every time I come to Toronto. I began wondering the first time I saw this red building many things. Did somebody make a mistake in the placement of the building? Who design it? Did they get what they asked for? Why is the building facing Bloor in this odd angle? There is a Sunset Grill and Loblaw food stood near by plus the metro station. Parking places inside the buildings abound. Looking at this red building from Bloor is a way for making my appreciation for urban architecture take on different level of growth. That only goes so far as the surrounding urban landscape along Bloor is being changed with the construction of condominiums and office buildings to the detriment of downtown Toronto in my opinion. Clogging up the streets with more places for people to live is one thing but giving the neighborhoods more people to deal with is another one. So much of downtown Toronto is being changed in this way. I ask you to visit the tall red building at Bloor and Church and go inside to see the interior design - the same color red brick is there to be admired. Sit on the benches inside and watch people pass by going to the elevators and the vegetation grow in the spaces outside. I have red parts of the newspaper there just to find an excuse to stay there.You should do the same. Then go outside and admire the red structure of the entire building. For me this is urban architecture at is finest. If I need an extra reason to walk along Bloor eastward fromYoung here it is. Do the same!"

Today, several of the storefronts are papered over, and there has been a considerable turnover among the others. The retail outlets are not high end, selling to the hip and monied gay community. The daily inhabitants appear to be mostly middle-aged men and aging single women, both groups very often attached to small dogs. In the evenings, the bars still come alive, but much of the \"cutting edge\" of LGBTQ culture has moved west to Ossington Ave. If you want decent food and a grown-up, middle-aged atmosphere, Church Street is still a great place.

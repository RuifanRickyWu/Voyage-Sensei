Our driver/guide, Chafin, was awesome and provided history, stories, and humor along the way. I recommend bringing an extra pair of socks for the Niagara Falls boat portion because your pants, socks and shoes from the knees down will get wet. But it's totally worth it!"

On the way back we stopped at Niagara on the Lake & it was a super cute town, but again felt very rushed & the town was packed.  25- 40 min wait for coffee, ice cream etc. So you basically just get a little sneak peak at the area and don’t really get a chance to experience it."

This is so worth the money as you learn so much and get dropped off exactly where you need to be so no time is wasted. The boat trip is well worth it, and Niagara on the Lake is absolutely beautiful. Only downside is we couldn’t have stayed there longer! We were in a smaller bus as opposed to the large coach which we were initially worried about but we needn’t have been as it was lovely just to have a few of us and felt a lot more personal ( just be warned there is no toilet or internet as advertised on the small coach). This is a trip well worth the money and Shaf is a credit to the company."

This was only a short stop but it was nice to taste the different wines. Next stop was our 3 course lunch overlooking the Falls. What a superb location. Lunch was ok, it’s nothing special, you get soup to start with then chicken and apple crumble and a choice of soft drinks, there is also a choice of fish, but it is adequate to keep you going for the rest of the day, but the view from the terrace where we ate was spectacular. We then went on the boat tour to Horseshoe Falls. All I can say is wow but be prepared to get absolutely drenched. A bit of advice, leave your trainers on the coach and wear flip flops then you won’t spend the rest of the day with very soggy feet. We then drove to Niagara on the Lake, which is one of the most beautiful places I’ve ever seen. The flowers everywhere were just stunning. The trip is a long day but was made so much more enjoyable by our guide and driver (Issac) I can’t remember the exact name of our guide but he was very good. (We went on Friday 27th Sept). We thought the trip was excellent value for money but it is a very long day but worth every second. Please book with this company as we couldn’t fault there time keeping and knowledge and they made the trip a very very enjoyable day. Thank you."

Incredible experience and photographs. Time is tight and the 'bonus' stop at the maple n chocolate stop on the way to Niagara on the Lake, felt a bit contrived suiting the guide. Niagara on the Lake is a beautiful last stop before heading back to Toronto. Traffic meant that we reached our drop off point at 19:40.

        "We had booked a month in advance and had to change from Saturday to Sunday a week in advance. This was confirmed by Tripadvisor. A day in advance the organisers said Sunday was not possible as it was overbooked and we would have to do Saturday or cancel. Absolutely ZERO support or refund, just blame Tripadvisor. We don't care who Travelling Chicken use as a distribution channel as they remain fully responsible for any marketing channel they use. This caused quite a stir as we had to rebook our other Saturday plans."

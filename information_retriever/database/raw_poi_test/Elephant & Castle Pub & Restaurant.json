        "Went to elephant and castle king street for dinner with 20 friends pre phantom of the opera and was shocked to see how big the place was! They seated us at the back of the restaurant and our server was Stephanie (with a trainee who I don’t recall her name).  Food and drink was serviced accurately and timely and it offered us a place for us to talk without ridiculously loud music. We finished our dinner and drinks with plenty of time to get to the theatre!! Since we enjoyed our experience so much, we brought the same group back post show and once again, had a wonderful time!! Stephanie was exemplary on both visits and it was really her that made both visits perfect!! The orders and bills were accurate and the space was absolutely perfect for our friends to get together!! Convenient to both theatres so as subscribers, we will definitely be back!! Thanks so much!!"

She said that it was possible, but she would be tapping with a different cork (she put the original cap on the trash).  So far, no problems. Nevertheless, the inserted the cork too deep into the bottle, that I would have difficulties to take it off. I asked help and she was able to take only a little off.  I mentioned that this would not help me. And she told me that, given the hole made, they would not be able to further help.  I ended up leaving the (almost full) bottle of wine to her....  lack of good sense, on my opinion.  It damaged all the experience.  "

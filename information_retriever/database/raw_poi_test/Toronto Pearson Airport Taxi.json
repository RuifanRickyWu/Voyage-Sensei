        "We did some research before arriving at Toronto Pearson Airport as we needed to get from there to Downtown Toronto (Peter Street).  On arrival we booked an Uber which was $45 (Canadian) - they pick you up from an allocated area, just follow the signs in the airport (itâ€™s very clear). A taxi would have cost around $74 (Canadian) with a 15%tip.  You do need the Uber app on your phone to use this service but itâ€™s pretty straightforward. Thereâ€™s free Wi-Fi at the airport which enables you to use the app (we always turn off data roaming before we board the plane to avoid high data costs).  If you are on a tight budget or just want to save money then using Uber is a good option. There is an Express Bus from the Airport to Downtown (terminates near Union Station) which is very good value. It really depends how many of you are travelling and how far away your accommodation is from Union Station."

Yesterday I got into another one doing the exact same trip and they increased the price by $40 (flat rate I asked for at the beginning of the trip). The driver argued with me when I brought up the discrepancy. Unfortunately an Uber wasnâ€™t available so I was swindled with no other option to get home late at night. Young girls beware, I feel take advantage of. Not to mention the car had many service lights flashing and was making weird noises.  I learned my lesson and will pre-book an Uber from now on."

        "I made arrangements with his company to have a taxi with two child seats ready to pick up my family at Pearson a few days ago. Not only did I reserve online and follow up regarding the car seats by email (with a positive reply), I also followed up by calling and speaking to someone. He said that yes they have a driver with two car seats and no I don't have to do anything else to confirm the reservation. Sigh of relief.",
        "When my family got to the airport, there was no taxi under our name. When we called the company again he said there were no cars with carseats available. What?? My two young children and the rest of my family were stranded at the airport. ",
        "So. I personally will never use this company again on principle, even if I'm travelling alone. But I strongly suggest that anyone travelling with children avoid them - it feels like you've found a solution only to end up with a massive hassle at the end of an already long day."

Taxi driver of Taxi# 610  became verbally abusive when we asked for the cost of the ride. He also threatened us several times to leave us on the highway if we were to ask for the cost again. The taxi driver was obviously angry and was driving erratically, he was cutting other cars off, break checking other cars, at times driving way over speed limit and at times driving way below speed limits. He kept using his phone while driving!",
        "The driver also refused wear a face mask (please see attached picture). No one should get in a Taxi and fear for their lives the entire way home. I hope you take proper actions against the driver so, he does not put anyone else's lives at risk. We also have a video of his behavior. We are looking forward to hear from you first before taking any further actions"

Whenever we get the cab and I donâ€™t know if itâ€™s because of the flat rate request, we notice that the driver never engages in conversation with us. Itâ€™s dead silence, not ever the radio is on. We always tip about $5 and if the driver would be more engaging then we would tip more. I read on line that you you should tip 15% to 20% of the fare. I didnâ€™t know that but if thatâ€™s the case than $5 is all Iâ€™m tipping for the rudeness i feel Iâ€™m getting. "

The dispatcher was very apologetic and said the driver was late but would arrive in 5 minutes.  No limo arrived.  I called again and the dispatch of an unknown taxi company answered.  Toronto Pearson Airport Taxi and Limo had forwarded my call directly to another taxi company.  The unknown dispatcher knew nothing about this and told me that \"just one minute ago I received an order for your address.\"  Unfortunately, they did not have a van for me.  We had to make alternate arrange.  This is a warning to all that Toronto Pearson Airport Taxi and Limo (xxx-9321) is NOT reliable. I will not use them again."

        "We arrived at 9pm in Toronto and were tired and looking for a taxi. We saw signs that were leading us to Gate D for a taxi. Tried to get help from the \"Customer Service/Information\" counter but the staff were impolite and most unhelpful. Walking toward the gate, a man approached us closer to Gate D. Very friendly and said he could get us a taxi to our hotel. I asked the price and he told us it was a flat rate, not too much to Downtown. Well, like idiots we trusted him because we heard that taxis from the airport have to charge a flat rate, but we were not sure how much. He took us outside via the elevator in the terminal. Then brought a car around and told us it was CAD 74 plus tax. We assumed this was reasonable. When we got to the hotel, he took out his eftpos machine and swiped our card and said it would be CAD 89 with taxes. This still seemed Okay. Then came the tip he punched in and when we looked at our receipt it was CAD 118. We were at the hotel reception, tired and shocked at the cost of a taxi and then the manager advised us that the rate should not be more than CAD 60 to or from the airport. So beware! Learn from our mistake and do not use taxi drivers soliciting business from inside the airport terminal. Go out to the taxi rank and they have to charge you the flat fare, we are told. Toronto!! Not a good first impression."

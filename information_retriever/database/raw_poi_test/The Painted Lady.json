        "Little Portugal is an area that was recommended by a couple of folks. Apparently it has quite a few bars and restaurants. (they’re right!) So googled what was popular within the area. The Painted Lady came up and it sounded like fun. (live music and burlesque are its specialties) After grabbing a bite elsewhere popped in to Painted Lady and had a couple of drinks. There was a $10 cover and what sounded like a rock band was on stage. They sounded really good. (not sure when burlesque occurs) Didn’t stay long, but this venue and the area seems to hosts Torontonians more than tourists. I appreciated that. It gave me, what felt like,  a more authentic experience. (as a tourist)"

We went in for burlesque, which we have seen many times.  The theatre of the seduction was 100% absent from this display, which consisted solely of the dancer writhing on the bar.  We left after one quick drink."

The acts they had at this quaint, sweet little bar were all exceptionally talented and I would have happily have paid $5 to join the crowd! Great selection of alcoholic beverages and reasonable prices. Highly recommend visiting for a live music chill!"

The price is always right, and the staff there is fantastic. They also have some pretty tasty menu items when you get hungry including pulled pork!"

        "Been flying in and out of Toronto for years. And I've been to at least a thousand bars all over the world. My work takes me all over. And, I love bars, and this one is very special. The best places have an energy you can't deny, and The Painted Lady has it in spades. Bars like this are very few and far between. You just can't manufacture something like The Painted Lady. She's got an authenticity and feel like no other.",
        "I asked how the place came to be, and a fellow patron piped up and told me about how the owners spent many years in New Orleans' pre-Katrina days, how their good friends were 'dancers' there, rock & movie stars, and famous writers and photographers, and how they traveled a bunch to other locales, yet were really down-to-earth... Forget the gal's name, but she must have been a regular. In any case, truly, you can feel there's something else going on here - it doesn't feel like any other bar in Toronto. Can't believe I've never been here before...",
        "My co-worker had a Caesar, and she said it was one of the best she's ever had. I love wheat beer, so I was shocked to see Weihenstephaner on tap, but they had a selection of other great beers as well ranging from local craft brews to seldom seen Red Rider from the other side of Canada. Everything on tap was great and well-chosen. Solid place for drinking beer, if you LIKE beer. But the mixed drinks were exceptional as well. I chased my beers down with an 'Old Fashioned' that was made sooo right! I've had thousands of these and this was one was crazy good.",
        "The music was great, one song after the next. The sound in this place was incredible - really! The bartenders were nice, attentive, and personable... The crowd was friendly, eclectic, loud, but fun - it was a Friday night! And the lovely lady dancing was mesmerizing. I'm a guy, but even my lady friend/co-worker loved her, and commented on how really what a great burlesque performer she was - how she really rode the fine line between sex and class.",
        "We had a blast! Got out of our minds and skins, and had a night to remember! What a place! I love the Painted Lady! Got to be one of my favorite bars in Canada - what am I saying??? Probably one of my favorite bars in the world. She's apparently been going strong for 8 years, and I can understand why. She's got that special vibe man, that makes you feel so buzzed and warm inside. You know it from the moment you sit down at that beautiful wood bar. Classic place. I'll see you soon!"

I love when a women feels empowered to be sexual in a way without being too, strip show, and this was not a good representation of that. The dancer lacked tease and suspense. Overall, I think this establishment has potential. I would visit again to see if the other dancers are different, but until then I rank this place as so-so. "

Amazing dj, great atmosphere and non stop fun. You want good times this is the place to go!!"

The DJ was super awesome, playing a mix of 80s and 90s dance hits. Then, right when you thought it couldn't be more fun a burlesque dancer hopped on top of the bar and started dancing. Small and intimate, this club is so so fun and I can't wait to go back.",

The first time we went there last year, we missed the entertainment (a rock band that night), but enjoyed a great beer selection and a nice chat with a friendly bar tender.  This time we went on a busy Saturday night in time for the entertainment and they had a geat dj playing eighties music and a burlesque dancer dancing on the bar!  We definitely have this on our our must see list because there is always something cool and different going on and the clientelle is a good mix."

I kindly request Sky Zone's administration to withdraw from the Access2 program to avoid misleading people. You're not providing any real assistance to children with disabilities, so participating in the Access2 program is deceptive.",

        "Having been to the flying squirrel trampoline park this facility ranks pretty low. Very little variety and poor safety standards , I had trouble finding an actual adult who seem to be in charge of this facility. When my grandchildren first went on the trampolines, there were three members of the staff who  standing talking to one another, I asked what their job was and they said to watch the children. I told them I didn’t think they were actually doing their job. At that point they split up and circulated. There didn’t seem to be any monitoring of the staff. Most of these kids seem to be teenagers and it’s part of the beast that they socialize .(in this case, leaving young children unsupervised. ",

Wear loose, breathable active wear clothing as it gets really hot inside when you are sweating. The 10 for 8 pass is worth it if you have energetic jumpers + friends. I don't know how my kids do the 60 min jumps but I can only do 30 min before everything hurts from falling down. I guess that means I better get into better shape or become younger. The orange socks are great to wear in or out of the jump zone. Noisy inside so not really a relaxing place to wait for your kids but the toilets are clean and they have seating/snacks available. Good for birthday parties and events. Bring $2 for the locker, sign/print online waiver and buy tickets online since they sell out quickly. It's fun but pricey."

You are being watched constantly by some teenager and if you even land by mistake in someone else's square they are all over you.

Even if you are waiting for someone there are limited areas to stop and it's extremely difficult to drive around.  Once in, even though we did sign their waiver online, it seems since we did not do it way in advance, they did't have a record of it and made us do it again.  One line-up to register, another to get socks and finally they let your group in, which is extremely frustrating and seems like a very disorganized system.

One child was forced to jump alone in a secluded area and forced to only use 2 jumping squares as the other area was being used. I understand this is not the staffs fault. They blame it on safety , but plenty of other indoor trampoline parks allow the children to mingle and jump together. It's unfortunate I already spent $100 for the kids to jump separately.

        "We are really looking forward to our event and just had to go ahead and recognize the stellar customer service we have already received."

        "We took a group of special needs students here and we all had a blast.  Our group of 16 had children aged 6-11 and a variety of special needs from mild to severe.  Our children had the run of the place for 30 minutes (which was plenty) and staff were permitted to jump and play with the kids.  The only downside was we had to wait for much longer than we had been told and keeping such a group of children entertained in a new environment was tricky.  All said, we would go back again."

        "I have gone twice, once during the day and once for GLOW and my entire group had so much fun. Keep in mind we are all adults so we were put off into an area together, but people are seperated by size.  I would say an hour is enough, but during GLOW you get 2 hours, and if you can power through almost everyone is gone by the end. GLOW also has good music and it's, in my opinion, a lot more fun. You also get a shirt along with your ticket. Don't forget to sign your online waver and print it before you go in or you will be waisting a lot of time when you get there. That is a down side, if you arrive late, that time is taken from you. We arrived 15 minutes late the first time we went during the day due to a snow storm, so we only got 45 minutes of jumping even though we paid for an hour. Make sure you get there early! Also lockers cost $2 so if you want to keep your phone or wallet in them don't forget to bring a toonie."

        "My friend and I went to \"Toddler Time\" this morning (9AM - 10AM) with our two 2.5 yr olds and it was a disaster. ",
        "First off, we were told that due to overcrowding which sometimes (but doesn't always) happen, we wouldn't be allowed to jump with our kids. We had to watch from the blue perimeters of the trampolines. Then we were also told we couldn't sit on the perimeters, that if we wanted to sit we had to do it on the one designated sideline. But we were also told that our toddlers couldn't share a trampoline (only 1 kid per trampoline square) so we couldn't sit on the designated sidelines because we had to constantly chase down our toddlers to make sure they weren't playing together on the same trampoline. ",
        "Then at 10AM when Toddler Time was over and Open Jump began, we were herded over to one smaller section of the trampoline zone and told that our kids had to stay there because they were too small to use the whole zone during Open Jump. So we tried to contain our kids to the side we'd been herded to -- only to be told by another employee that we were now in the \"adults only\" section and had to go back over to the  other side if our toddlers wanted to keep jumping. At which point I said enough's enough and asked the worker to explain how any of these rules made sense. He tried, bless his heart, and eventually explained to us that the first employee was incorrect; our kids WERE allowed to play on the other side of the zone. But that the side we were currently on was for \"adults only\". (Note: there were ZERO adults jumping at this time. And not a single person used the \"adults only zone\" until 10:30). ",
        "I understand that for safety reasons these places need rules. But being super stringent about rules that are essentially impossible to follow especially for toddlers -- i.e. Don't bounce on the same square as your friends; don't sit down on the trampolines; you can't go on that half of the zone even though you were just over there because at some point some grown up MIGHT want to jump over there... It's too much. It actually became stressful for a number of parents. I heard at least 6 other parents complaining that the rules were difficult to understand and impossible to follow.",
        "A word of advice for management... allow your employees to use their discretion. There's no point shooing parents and toddler away from the \"adults only\" zone if there are NO ADULTS playing in that zone. Inform parents about the rules and say \"If bigger kids/adults show up and want to use this side, your kid will have to go play over there.\" Totally fair. But trying to explain to a 2.5 year old why this square is okay to jump in but this one is not, but the one that was okay to jump in earlier is no longer okay to jump in because it's now 10:30... you just ensured that my family and our friends will never go back.",
        "I will give a shout-out to one employee though. Miguel was awesome and helped us clear up the discrepancies between what two different employees told us. He was also very patient and understanding with the families who were breaking rules all over the place without realizing it."

        "We have been to a couple of Skyzone trampoline parks, and we generally have a pretty good time.  Our kids are 11, 9, and 4, and there is something that is good for both age groups.  How much enjoyment you get out of the visit depends on whether you enjoy trampolines.  It is definitely a good exercise (unexpectedly) and you feel can work up a good heart rate and sweat during your visit.  There is a giant foam pit (which my 4 year-old loves), as well as basketball nets of varying heights that my older boys like trying to dunk on.  Dodgeball is by far their favourite, but the games are scheduled by “groups” and they don’t get into as many games as they’d like during the 60 minute visits.",
        "The initial visit can be quite pricey given you need to purchase their specialty socks.  I suggest doing the online waivers to save yourself some time.",
        "Overall, our kids really do enjoy visiting Skyzone, but it can get a bit bland if you visit frequently (I find, as we had a couple of back to back events there recently).",
        "We found the overall cleanliness and upkeep of both Skyzone locations that we visited were quite good, and the staff generally quite helpful and friendly."

        "I went to sky zone with my younger 13 year old brother, whom of which i was exited to jump around with. However, we were told by the staff that we would have to be separated to opposite sides of the trampoline area due to his smaller size compared to mine (being 14). This was very unfortunate as my brother is not only small for his age but also feels bad about his height and dislikes that he bounced with only eight year olds while I was jumping beside people younger than him. After about ten minutes, most of the kids left to go play dodgeball and my side of the trampoline area was almost empty. I then told my brother that he could come to my side as it seemed safe. To much dismay, an employee immediately came over to tell him to get back over to his side of the trampolines. I get the safety concerns, but still, they should be able to make some situational exemptions. other than that, it was an hour well spent as we could communicate across the trampolines. Just for next time, I wish the staff would be more understanding and lenient, especially when it involves older six-conciouss teenagers."

        "Arrived with my kids - 8 and 10 years old on a Tuesday morning.   Purchased 2 hours of jumping for each of them.  Within  20 minutes to a half hour, they complained of boredom.  The boredom was brought about by the kids who work there continually interfering with \"rules\", such as (1) they could not jump on trampolines near each other, (1b) were told to leave the trampoline area when a camp arrived (2) not being allowed to play dodge ball - 3 courts were running, all with teens and smaller kids weren't allowed to play where big Kids were.   All 3 courts however were taken up by older kids, (3) the lines at the foam pit were not fair, as described by other users on this site... workers would allow the same kids to go over and over. ",
        "I complained to staff that my kids had paid the same to be there as others, however were being barred from  every attempt to jump or play.  After 90 minutes of complete frustration, we left.",

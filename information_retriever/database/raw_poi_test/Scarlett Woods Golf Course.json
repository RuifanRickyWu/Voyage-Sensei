  "description": "York-Crosstown is a sleepy area of Toronto dotted gorgeously with hills and farmland, stately homes and parks. An affluent district in parts, the stately houses at Baby Point along Jane Street are especially breathtaking, and make for a lovely wander on a clear day. Parks are bountiful in York-Crosstown, which makes it a vibrant area for outdoor play and sports, providing a break from the hustle of Toronto's busy, jam-packed city center. For a little spice after a walk in the park, the Little Jamaica area of York sports cheap, authentic food from the Caribbean. This area is restful and more orientated towards outdoor activity and the exploration of nature.",

        "I used to love this course.  Close to home, good pace of play, had no complaints.  The management and staff have gone full clown show.  $500 deposit on carts? They don't even do that at good courses.  I have a family member that calls in to book tee times regularly.  I called today to book a tee time and was told by the woman who answered the phone that apparently \"she could not do it for me.\" Pure laziness.  This is a City Course, why am I being charged by JT LEE Golf separately for my golf cart? I just don't get it.  I can't be the first person to have these questions.  Shut this place down and hire some new people."

I typically play 6688 yards courses,so Scarlett's 3749 yards allows you to use your irons more.During our game, we saw goslings ,and either an Eastern Ribbon ,or Garter snake,along with lots of birds."

If the people ahead of you keep a good pace, you can finish the full course within 3-3.5 hours. We took four full hours today, as we had to wait for the group before us all the time. In general, we enjoyed the game there and we will come back."

Of course they don't tell you this upon booking and certainly not when they swipe your credit card. Not only that, many of the holes read over a 100 on the card but in reality or 60-70.  If the course I researched online actually existed it might have been good. Its a a very misleading scam if you ask me. Oh, and its full of kids, duh.  Never will return unless its free."

        "I've played this course 100x. I love it.",
        "I find people have a lot of negative comments about this track....most of them are spot on ;) It's an executive in the middle of city. You're going to get new golfers. Prime-time afternoon rounds can be a grind, ranging from slow to excruciating. It's also jammed fairly tight together due to the constraints of being a city muni. Invariably you get about a ball per round flying in at you, rarely accompanied by 'FORE' or any other warning. You look back. They stare at you like a deer in the headlights. You curse, shake your head and play on. The etiquette breaches are plentiful. I've pretty much seen it all at this course. Refer to point no 1: It's an executive muni in the middle of the city. If you're looking for a smooth, speedy round, simply do not play here. Drive down the street to Lambton or St. George's.",
        "That said, this course has a lot of positives. Tee-off in the early AM and the pace of play isn't that bad. I've done it in ~2-2.5h with no one in front. I find that not enough reviewers focus on the challenge of golf. For a 4000y muni, this place is a ton of fun. Mature trees, water on about a third of the holes. Most of the par-4s are different from one another, many offering a dog-leg to add some difficulty. The par-3s are fairly vanilla but you still have to have a good wedge game to score on this course. Greens are relatively slow and easy, not much in the way of undulation.",
        "The par-4 7th has you hitting a 200y tee-shot down a hallway framed by mature trees to earn you a 150y approach. Tough hole anywhere. And the par-3 signature 17th over the pond with a sucker false left side is always in the back of your mind as you seem to be cruising through your round. Witnessed my first ace here, and not on one of the 100y straight-away par-3s as you might imagine. My buddy nutted a 5i on the 182y par-3 9th that landed in the centre of the green and rolled about 10-15ft into it's happy place. Golf perfection achieved!",
        "For all the flack this place gets, I feel that done right, it's a very fun place to play a round of golf. If you can get around this track in the 60s, you can play just about anywhere."

        "This is a public 18-hole executive course that happens to have 4 very exclusive, private courses close by.  Regardless of your skill level, this course is enjoyable and has some challenging holes.  It is a busy course but between 12:00 noon and 2:00 pm during the week, it is not very busy and you can get through the course in 3 to 3.5 hours.  On the weekends, it can be very frustrating since it is usually quite slow so we avoid it then.  On Saturdays & Sundays there is Family Night which is a great opportunity to bring your kids for free.  It's not very busy then but you do run the risk of being stuck behind a family that isn't playing \"best ball\".  An enjoyable course that we've been playing for over 10 years and plan to continue playing."

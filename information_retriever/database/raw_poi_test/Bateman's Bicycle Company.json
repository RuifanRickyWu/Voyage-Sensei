        "I cannot recommend Bateman’s Bicycle Store. I bought a very expensive custom built bike from them which has caused me great stress and no end of problems. Despite being crystal clear that I wanted to ride upright. I could not easily reach the handlebars and was crunching forward awkwardly. I returned to the store many times for unsuccessful adjustments. Finally Batemans said  nothing that could be done. ",
        "I also had to return for other shoddy work: the basket was mounted so close to seat, it was not possible to sit on it;  in one unsuccessful attempt to fix the main problem, the shifter was twisted so it could not be reached and the brakes were angled too far down to access; one of the tires kept going flat; the kick stand interfered with bike function etc. ",
        "As a last resort, we went to Bloomfield Bicycle Company in Prince Edward County which had been very helpful with our old bikes. I learned that the medium bike frame sold to me by Bateman’s is too large/long for my height. ",
        "Bloomfield were able to replace the handlebars with ones I could reach sitting upright. They also said the grips were too long and large for my hands, and had been installed improperly. They replaced the plastic white clip ties holding the basket which they thought were dangerous  and could snap with black metal clamps. ",
        "It was very time consuming and costly to go to Prince Edward County since we had to stay overnight in and pay for accommodation. But I can now ride my bike comfortably. I cannot recommend Bateman’s Bicycle Store"

        "My \"Norco Search\" Cyclocross bike rented from Bateman's for 10 days proved very sturdy, never swerving or oscillating even under considerable load, even quickly going downhill, with a rack mounted above the back wheel, a pair of panniers attached to it, and a backpack strapped on top of the panniers, containing baggage for two weeks, including among other items a two-person tent, a sleeping bag, and a large laptop computer.  It was equipped perfectly with drop handlebars, twenty gears covering a wide range, and excellent disc brakes.  All parts were smooth-running and required no maintenance even after several hundred kilometers on roads of varying qualities (including gravel roads and riding under rain).  This was clearly the best bicycle i found for rent in Canada so far, significantly better than the best i managed to find in Ottawa and Calgary.  Of course, a bike of this quality is not exactly cheap, but trying to economize in this respect would be a terrible idea:  You would ruin your holiday experience or even risk your health with a bike of inadequate quality...",
        "Service was very friendly, relaxed, and helpful.  For example, a rack was installed on my request even though Bateman's doesn't normally rent out bikes with a rack.  Communication was slightly bumpy; my first email asking all the questions that mattered to me was quickly answered, and to my full satisfaction; consequently, i wrote in again to make the reservation binding, asking for a confirmation, but got no reply even after trying twice.  So i ended up simply reserving via the web form.  When i arrived to collect the bike, it had indeed been reserved, but the required installations (rack, pedals) were not yet done.  No big problem since they were quickly completed on the spot, in my presence.  Anyway, it's a clear case for five stars because what ultimately matters is the quality of the bike provided, and that was spotless."

This people are very patient. We did not pick the bikes the day we were supposed and they still kept them for us. Then Jared suggested i changed the type of bicycle i was renting upon pickup. Much happy he did suggest a change. When we returned the bikes my colleague asked for a glass of water and Jared came back with two juices. I am usually prone to criticize more than to give in to commending but they have outstanding customer service. If you plan to rent a bike please consider doing it from them.

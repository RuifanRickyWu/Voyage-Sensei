So many local artists, vendors, DJs, and restaurant pop-ups/food trucks. Just a good little vibey place to walk around. I'm not sure what its like on a normal day though, but I assume the little local shops and vendors are there pretty often?"

The place was totally dead and locked up. We walked around reading every sign. Nowhere was there any information about times! Every poster / calendar had dates and events but nowhere was there any information on opening times! Why on earth would you not advertise when stores are open!!? We peered in shop windows and walked around for 20mins then left, none the wiser as to when anything there would be open!! So disappointing!"

Also the little shops were open and it was definitely lots of fun, and a great find"

Who wants to give a small donation can, through the coin into a collecting box like to do. In the rooms are historic objects on display and a model of post-operation from Toronto earlier times. The best part is the way a letter with quill and ink to write to him to be sealed with sealing wax and let it bear a stamp from 1833. It was great fun and it cost 1 CAD. Against payment of the regular postage, he can then immediately be sent. The lady was very helpful and explained everything in detail and answered questions patiently.

Behind the business area of the post office is a small back room complete with one of the original brink fireplaces. There you will find a wooden table, slips of paper and quill pens. Dip the quill in the ink and try your hand at writing. If you drip? Sprinkle some sand from the little pot on the table which acts as the most efficient blotter. The post master was friendly and welcoming and there were letter writing supplies, post cards, books, and some hand made messenger bags, etc for sale. The cost is donation only. You may only spend 30 minutes here but it is a really nice 30 minutes."

We not only \"stopped in\" but ended up spending about an hour at this quaint and historical site.  It would probably not be anyone's #1 place to visit while in Toronto but we feel it should be on every list.  The girls working there were so informative and nice, so much that we felt \"at home.\"  There is a self guided tour available along with the opportunity to test your hand using a quill pen.  You can send a letter which is sealed with wax and also shop for some very unique,postal related gifts.

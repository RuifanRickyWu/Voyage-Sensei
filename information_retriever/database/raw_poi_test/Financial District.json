        "It also has its own underground world called the PATH, a series of underground tunnels that connect office buildings and Union Station.",
        "For our tour of the Financial District, we started on Front Street.  The first building he showed us and talked about was the stately Fairmont Royal York Hotel at 100 Front Street West right near Union Station.  It serves business and leisure travelers alike.  It is located above the PATH, a enormous underground complex for shopping and dining with access to adjacent Union Station.  Large Canadian, American, British,  Canadian Colonial, and Fairmont flags were flying over the entrance overhang.  We learned that it was not as expensive as one might think to stay there.  Rooms were in the $125.00 CAD range in the fall and winter.",

        "I thought the Toronto Finacial District rivaled any other financial district I've seen, and that includes New York City's FiDi, Zurich, and London.  The PATH underneath really sets it apart.",
        "We rate the Toronto Finacial District at 4.50  There's plenty to see and do there, especially in the underground PATH.  The shopping and dining options are worth a visit.",

Visitors will likely require a map, http://www.toronto.ca/path/. You should visit this area during business hours, but try to avoid the peak lunch time as it gets very busy. ",

Across the street is the is the first Bank of Nova Scotia building, now part of Scotia Plaza. The original branch shows a an interesting mural where you will note the bank's early interest in the Caribbean. ",

For better treats check out Prairie Girl, Brick Street Bakery, David's Tea, Vegetarian options, a small grocery--you're sure to find something. If you really want to treat yourself, put on your duds and make a reservation at Canoe, on the 54th floor of the TD Centre. There are plenty of shops all along the path."

        "Generally not thought to be a tourist destination, Toronto's compact Financial District might be appealing for someone visiting Toronto for the first time. It has some many fine examples of superb modernistic architecture -- RBC Plaza, Brookfield Place, TD Towers, First Canada Place, just to name a few.  These are truly magnificent structures.  Then there are the old standards, such as the Hockey Hall of Fame, Union Station, and the Royal York.  It is easy to navigate in foul weather with the various underground passage walkways (PATH) connecting the major buildings -- once you get the hang of it."

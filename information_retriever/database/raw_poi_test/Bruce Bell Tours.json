  "description": "Pandemic update. My St Lawrence Market/Old Town Toronto tours are $20 per person. Tours will be limited to 10 people and will run every Tues, Weds and Thursdays, Friday and Saturday. There will be an extra charge for my private tours. All tours will be in keeping with the latest Ontario Gov Covid-19 guidelines. Bruce Bell Tours: So much of Toronto's history is either buried under parking lots or confined to dusty history books hidden on the top shelves of libraries or just plain forgotten. Using his wealth of knowledge and experience well known historian and author Bruce Bell is determined to look under those parking lots to see what secrets are held in Toronto's much overlooked colonial and 19th century past. Bruce also does a great food tasting tour at Toronto‚Äôs famed St Lawrence Market.",

Charming, witty, articulate and solicitous - he took us around nooks and crannies, behind walls and stairs as well as all around the market.  Every stop had a story, and every story had a history.  Generous with his time, and his genuine interest in everyone he meets - there can be no better walking tour in Toronto than Bruce Bell's."

My 80 year old mom easily maneuvered the market and streets and Bruce was attentive to her needs.  We visited the Cathedral of St. James also - just beautiful. The tour is affordable and the start location in the St. Lawrence market was easy to find.  Parking is nearby. So glad we started our vacation this way.

We are all retired or almost retired professionals who love to study history, culture, adventure, athletics and just having fun.  Within the first 30 minutes, Bruce had taught us a side of US history we had never known but thoroughly enjoyed.  His love of Toronto was contagious and we are now big fans of the city.  While we have toured other parts of Canada before, we have a much better appreciation of the history and culture of Canada and its beautiful people.  Bruce was so respectful and fun that we quickly felt like he had been a member of our group for years.  We will never forget him and, because of him, I feel a sense of sadness and pity for all other tour guides we will meet in the future.

        "We just finished our day and this morning we had the most wonderful tour with Bruce.  You could not ask for a more knowledgeable person.  He was so interesting and knew so much about Toronto, it just made our day.  We highly recommend him for a tour in Toronto.  Great value and a very enjoyable person to listen to, talk to and learn from."

        "A group of friends and I took a weekend trip to Toronto, and we decided to do a food tour. Personally, I had taken one in Galway, Ireland, and it was fantastic. I didn’t know if this food tour could compare, but it met the bar, if not raised it. Our guide, Amy, was fantastic! She had knowledge not only of the food and art, but also of the city. She was willing to converse with her group, and this made the tour much more personable. The range of food that was toured was wide, and it was all great. There was even tea, cookies, and ice cream! The street art was also beautiful, and the background of the artists made it even more interesting. We were even able to see an artist at work. I highly recommend this tour (ask for Amy)!"

        "We went on a lovely tour on a Sunday afternoon with Sidney as our guide. It was only 2 couples so it really felt very personal. We explored a few different neighborhoods and ate both sweet and savory; both well known and hidden gem.  It was a wonderful way to spend the afternoon. While none of us are vegetarian, our favorite stop was the plant based restaurant called Away. It was excellent and the chef and owner sat and talked to us which was really nice. My one very small critique would be that the tour should have included a stop at the ice cream place that is very famous and had no line. This was a great way for us to explore beyond the typical touristy neighborhoods and we loved the combination of walking and taking the street car"

We were picked up at our AirBnB in a limo bus that Foodies on Foot helped us coordinate and went for a 4 hour Best of Toronto tour. It was PHENOMENAL! The diversity of cultures, food and neighborhoods was great; especially because we are from Boston and had never explored the city before. I also loved that there was a combination of grab-n-go restaurants and sit down restaurants. We absolutely loved our tour guide, Laura, who was so incredibly patient with our large group of 14 and brought such a great energy to the afternoon. I highly recommend this as a big group activity. Can't wait to hit up all of those restaurants again during my next trip to Toronto!"

Unfortunately we came during an ice storm and it was very cold and windy outside but Laura was nice enough to still have the tour with just the two of us, even after another couple canceled. She was extremely helpful and knowledgeable and she made the tour really fun. We liked all the places she took us to and it was a nice surprise each time we arrived at a new place since she didn't tell us where we were going ahead of time. I would definitely take this tour again in the future and would recommend this tour to others visiting the city!"

Great tour for Torontonians who want to expand their horizons, or tourists who want to do something off the beaten path, out of the downtown core, and experience multiple neighbourhoods in a single afternoon. Food at each tasting location was fantastic so you will definitely want to come hungry - I'd recommend nothing more than a morning coffee on the day."

        "We are from Niagara and love to get to Toronto, the city has so much to offer so if you really don't know where to start and love food; Foodies on Foot is where it is at! We experienced the Toronto Food Tour, what a great dining experience. We were taken to 6 different location with our guide choosing what they feel is the special of the house - we were not disappointed! All was included in the cost (unless you wanted a wee sip to warm your insides) and we were so full that dinner was not even on the radar! Our guide Laura was lovely, she gave us a little history tour a long the way and pointed out some other restaurants to try on our next visit. From what I understand is no 2 tours are alike, it is based on group size, weather, timing AND they do private - I cannot wait to experience this again in the future!"

        "We're Toronto people and we love food. We get around a fair bit, and still we were introduced to several new and interesting food places in the city. A great tour!  Laura welcomed a small group very warmly and knowledgeably, and by the second stop, it felt like we were a group of friends out for an afternoon of foodie fun. All food talk all the time. Right up our alley. A hearty recommendation. "

        "Whether you are from out of town or live in Toronto this tour will not disappoint! Incredible way to see Toronto in a few hours. Guide was very knowledgeable and engaging. All of the stops were well thought out, delicious and fun. The food choices were unique and so tasty. I would advise not to make plans soon after the scheduled end time as there may be delays (normally because the group is engaged in good conversation throughout the tour!!) The price point of this tour is outrageous given the amount of food you get. I would encourage anyone attending this tour to come hungry and be prepared to bring leftovers! Best tour I've ever been on by far."

        "Took the Best of Toronto Food Tour as a way of \"giving back\" (haha) after watching the Seattle Sounders beat out Toronto FC for the MLS Cup. It was a great way to see the city and experience a variety of its neighborhoods, even in the cold and the snow. The venue selection was excellent, and I even ended up going back to two of its sites the next day for lunch before my flight. The guide, Laura, was knowledgeable and fun and offered some great tips for the rest of my stay. Highly recommended!"

        "Another GREAT tour with Foodies on Foot! This is my second experience with foodies on foot and each time it gets better! Steven is full of information on history and culture as we hit up some of the best places in Toronto to eat.  I love how it is planned to start with some breakfast food/drinks and end on a sweet dessert. The tour has a great balance between walking and public transport and you never leave hungry! ",

Live jazz, whether Dixieland, New Orleans, or swing, belts out 6 nights a week. The epicenter for the swing dance craze in Toronto, this is still the place to watch glam hepcats groove.",

We just rocked up on the night and paid 15 Cad entrance fee .. all of the tables were taken so stood at the bar .. The first thing you get is this incredible jazz vibe ..Everyone there was obviously having a great time. The band were sensational..the cocktails even better ..  It was a pleasure to be there . Just brilliant. !!  Highly recommended.. Bring your dancing shoes. !"

Pennies from heaven ( ? ) .. not going back on a Saturday until he’s out of there , sorry 😞"

I wish I had taken some pictures.  Their strawberry coconut martini was soooo good.  We also had their chicken skewers and a flatbread pizza and crème brûlée.  Service was great as well.

        "visited Toronto 3 weeks ago and  I always look for a jazz / blues club  where ever I go.  All of my research kept leading me to try the Reservoir Lounge and  the Poetry Room. I had some folks with us who had never experienced live blues/jazz club before so I wanted to get it right. I had 8 people in my party so I needed a reservation. That is the one and only negative. They don't have an online system and you have call at least a week out and leave a voicemail with your details. They do call back but I was a little nervous because of the popularity of the place. We were reserved for  Friday night at 8pm on the day of our arrival. We were going to be late because of some travel issues coming in from Buffalo. I called ahead to advise but had to leave a voicemail. I believe that I had to call back and actually got the owner on the phone this time. No problem changing our time to 8:45pm but I believe that we lost our prime time Seating at that point. We arrived at via Lyft and had to be dropped off probably a half block away because of construction in  the area. Upon entry you are greeted by the owner and a hostess and you pay your cover which is $20. I advise them that 2 people had dropped from our reservation ( They missed out ). We were anxious to get in because I could hear the set getting ready to start, so I didn't haggle about the US vs CA. They lead us to a table away from the front to a cozy little spot to the left and back against a wall. At first I was not to happy because it wasn't a front on site line, but we were late, so what was I gonna say? The place was almost packed and vibe was starting to jump. I love the darkness of the club. Our server came right away to get drinks and food started. I wish that I had written his name down because he gave us a lot of attention and we all loved this guy by the time we left. The drinks were great! This is one of the very few places we've been where my wife didn't send her drink back and even requested another round. I  did tell him that one of my long islands was a little weak and he told me that he would get the next one tightened up. The food selections are limited,  but most of us got the sliders and pizza and all of was great. That table location ended up being a good spot! It was cozy and we could see most of the band and the newbies in the group didn't have to worry about it being to loud. I would probably ask for this spot if I was ever to get back. The restrooms / sorry washrooms were small but clean. The group that played that night were fantastic! The lead vocalist had some soul inside of her! Would definitely recommend and wish that I had a spot like this in Houston Texas! We never made it to the Poetry Room so I can't offer a comparison. "

        "10 of us visited in November of 2021 (just before everything shut down again due to Covid) to celebrate my birthday. We were quickly greeted at the door but I took away a point as one had to pay cash for the cover charge which I was not told when I made the reservations and most of my friends only carry plastic which was irritating as many had to run to a bank machine.  It is a cramped space but I knew this upon making the reservations and the food choice were quite limiting especially when I had one individual in the group who is gluten intolerant and another who is vegan but both did have at least once choice.  Although limited choices, I found the food was delicious (I had the burger sliders and the mushroom toast) and the atmosphere is electric.  The band was outstanding and everyone was up dancing again on the cramped dance floor.  It was a crowded space but as we had a table we were just fine. We all had a fantastic night and I would definitely go back again and same as last time ensure I reserved a table as otherwise it would just be too crowded for me with barely standing room. I took off one point simply due to the cash only cover charge (when everything else inside you could pay with plastic and no mention of this) and the limited menu but other than that would be 5 stars."

We got there around 8:30/9pm, which worked out in time because we got the last table!  If you are going for dinner and drinks, I would advise making a reservation at least 2 days in advance (I couldn't the night before) if you want to sit at a table.  Otherwise, after 10pm it is standing room only.  By 11:30pm  the place is quite busy, and very lively.  The crowd was mixed, mainly 30+ in age.  The staff was excellent!  The lounge lost a star for me due to the closeness (and small size) of the tables, and lack of seating space.  Otherwise, Reservoir lounge is definitely a great night out with friends or on a hot date."

As soon as we mentioned we were from the US they offered suggestion for site seeing and more! Felt like I was chatting with old friends!  Now, to the drinks...I had the strawberry coconut martini which was tasty and refreshing! Drink it slow because it's THAT good! For food...if you like mushrooms you MUST order the Phyllo Rolls and Wild Mushroom Devil's Toast! Both were so yummy! The Rolls were flaky and full of flavor and the toast was EVERYTHING and then some! Our waitress Brooke was AMAZING! Hope you get her because she's super attentive and offers great advice on the menu.

If you are going to ID people maybe you should do that to everyone as clearly this is not the case, and also make it clear on your website of this rule. Also please have the person answering the phone giving out correct information when they are asked questions, I work in this industry it is not that hard, it requires a minimal amount of brain cells (unless you're intoxicated, which explains your eyes). The fact that not a single employee had the decency to simply apologize for the misunderstanding instead of insult my family tells us and all our friends what we need to know about this establishment and that continuing to go to The Rex Hotel Jazz and Blues Bar (194 Queen St W, Toronto, ON M5V 1Z1) is the better choice in both customer service, and overall atmosphere."

Food on offer with a variety of dishes available.  I arrived around 9.15pm in time for the first set of the 'Band' playing. The music on offer from the Jazz combo was superb, a mix of moody and lively, played by tremendously talented musicians. The second set featured more up tempo music and the bar started to fill up by around 11pm. A great atmosphere I can highly recommend!! "

By the time the Leafs game got out, there was not a place to move in the bar. Good luck getting a drink or navigating to the washroom. We would have actually stayed all night if it wasn't so busy. No fault of the servers who were doing an amazing job despite all of the people crammed in. On a regular night I'm sure this place is great, I liked the mix of people from old to young enjoying live jazz."

  "description": "Midtown is a dynamic part of Toronto with some of its most stylish high-rise residences and heritage buildings. The area sees busy shoppers with bag-laden arms balancing lattes in paper cups as they travel from one luxury brand to the next, taking advantage of the proximity of high-end shops. The reflecting pools, jogging trails, and nature treks of the Rosehill Revision are always a hub of outdoor activity, and after a workout from either running or splurging, many take advantage of the spas and massage parlors Midtown has to offer. Away from the bakeries, boutiques, and glamorous old theaters of the district's center, locals use the weekend to embrace the more suburban feel of Midtown's parks, tennis courts, outdoor markets, and the manicured grounds of Casa Loma, while families indulge the area's state-of-the-art playground and learning facilities. Of course, no high-brow district is complete without a healthy counter-culture: Midtown boasts some of the wildest street art and full-wall graffiti of any neighborhood in Toronto.",

The latter was particularly touching because on Friday we saw Come from Away at the Royal Alex Theatre. Hot Docs has a schedule for showing many different documentaries, and it should not be missed. The theatre is comfortable, you can bring a drink inside, and you will leave feeling you have spent your time well. Highly recommended!"

        "The Hot Docs Cinema is conveniently at Bloor and Bathurst; just steps away from Bathurst Subway station. It's a small theatre which is reflective of the audience size of documentaries. There are two levels; the stair to the second level is outside the auditorium which isn't hard to find. The theatre shows sign of an ageing providing an extra indie vibe. In spite of its size and age, the cinema is very clean including the lavatories. ",
        "If you drink alcohol, you're in luck because you could bring booze inside the theatre. There are no cup holders on the second level, so just be cognizant about that. The food offering is pretty basic but very inexpensive; I had a fountain drink and medium popcorn for under $10. Just give you context, Cineplex charges roughly $20 for popcorn and pop. Hot Doc's portion is much smaller - just enough for one person. ",
        "I've been here a few times and I can say that I am happy with the documentaries that they play. From time to time, you'd be able to listen to filmmakers talk about their documentaries."

Although there is only one screen (part of what makes it a good cinema), they offer several docs each day and run each film for at least a week so you're bound to find something you like at a time convenient for you.",

Sometimes, the filmmaker is there for a Q&A after the film. In those cases, they project the stage on the screen for those sitting in the balcony.",

        "We went to Hot Docs the splendid theatre committed to showing documentaries, to see \"Weiner\", a documentary about the former US congressman who wrecked his career by sexting. It's a sad story: all the positive things Anthony Weiner has done and is capable of doing get negated by media obsession with his highly inappropriate behaviour a few years ago. Weiner comes across as generally sympathetic, but although he keeps apologizing, he offers no explanations. The real object for sympathy is his wife Huma Abedin, who has loyally stood by her husband. The film is well worth seeing. \"Weiner\" is scheduled to be shown a few more times during the next month."

The place looks a lot better, the seats are much better than before, and the washrooms are much improved as well. Also: you can get a beer to drink while watching the film.

We got seats on the first floor and they were very comfortable full back seats with a bit of a tilt recline. Plenty of leg room so our tall guys were comfortable. I checked out the balcony seating and it looked pretty good as well, slightly smaller seats with less room but a good view. The washrooms are located on the second floor and I didn't check them out because there was a huge lineup so not sure about the facilities.  ",

One of my favourite things about this venue was that they had water fountains WITH disposable cups - a very rare but greatly appreciated feature that makes me want to return to this venue. ",

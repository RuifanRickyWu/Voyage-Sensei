Get us back to Amsterdam and the Black Eagle!  Won’t be returning."

There was no coat check, and I didn't realise there was a place to hang up your coat until I was leaving the bar.  Every time I went to get a drink or go to the washroom, I had to ask someone to look after my winter coats.  There is a coat check on Friday and Saturday night.  The place was filled with friendly guys, most in either leather or denim.  There is a dark room on the second floor, also a second bar, and an outside roof terrace."

        "I dearly miss The Toolbox.  The Black Eagle was a good stop-gap after The Toolbox closed down, but over time the bar has lost its way.  As this is the last self-proclaimed \"men's leather bar\", they sure don't feel that way most nights.  The last time I stepped in the place, I was shocked they had started to charge a cover -- but even more shocked to discover they rented the entire bar out to a straight organisation, and here I was with a dozen of my friends all dudded up in our leather with NO WHERE TO GO.  This was my final trip to Toronto and I won't be returning, there are no bars/clubs for leather men to go to. You can now find us in Montreal at Aigle Noir (which is barely a step up) but more often in Amsterdam where they still have real leather bars for MEN ONLY with leather dress codes.",
        "All I can recommend to whomever owns the Eagle: Pick a theme and stick with it 100%, you have alienated so many people over the past five years that the brand is now toxic.  If you're a cruise bar, don't play loud music -- stick with the bass & drum at a reasonable volume so people can socialise!!  If you're a dance bar, drop the pretence that you're a leather bar and change your name!!  If you're a leather bar, start enforcing a dress code (at least on Friday/Saturday nights).",

Popped in quickly, friendly atmosphere, good beer selection, pretty good open on the television. Not bad pricing. Could not get the bar tenders attention to grab a beer for  life of me! Horrible service. Another patron had to get to attention and when I finally got my almost 8$ a bottle he was acting like it was an inconvience that I was ordering. No. Just stop. There are better bars and better bar tenders on the area."

About fifteen minutes after the disc jockey began playing the music, one of the staff member approached me in a very rude manner, shouting at me saying it is mandatory to take off my clothes and be in my underwear, it was hard to talk because of the extreme loud music and he questioned me why I'm not buying a drink and I said I usually buy later when I sweat from dancing and he still insists that I should leave, I never experienced such rudeness in my life in going to a club, now how can I recommend this place to my friend?"

It is a ridiculously unfriendly bar with so much \"attitude\"  it almost seems unreal.  The bar staff could not be more unfriendly and unprofessional.  If you are lucky enough to find one who is not camping it up with one of his friends then you might get a drink. What a disappointing negative experience.  The bar caters to a youngish fem crowd. They also charge a hefty cover charge, the place is over crowded with no ventilation.  I could go on but the bottom line is, if you do not fit the right look you are not welcome...and they let you know that from the second you walk through the door."

        "On Halloween weekend of 2016, my domestic partner and I went to Toronto's Black Eagle. Black Eagle Toronto is located in Molly's Bush, Toronto's gay community. Before I describe our negative experience at the Black Eagle, I need to explain the effort we put into celebrating Halloween.",
        "We decided to dress up as ghouls. Between us we spent, $250 on our costumes and makeup. We spent two hours at home trying to make ourselves as ghoulish as possible. Now, we both knew how pathetic and insignificant the gay strip in Toronto has become over the last fifteen years but we decided to make a go of it.",
        "So, there we are at the entrance of the Black Eagle at prime time, Saturday night, Halloween weekend. The door person didn't even greet us in a welcoming, friendly way, he just said, \"fifteen bucks each to get in.\"",
        "I scanned the bar and I noticed there was absolutely no Halloween decorations whatsoever. The place was practically empty. The patrons who were there, were not even wearing costumes.",
        "Now, let's get this straight, I thought to myself. We spent, $250 to dress up in costumes, $30 total to get into the Black Eagle and if we had gone in, we probably would have spent about, $100 on booze. That works out to about 400 bucks, just to have fun. REALLY? ",
        "Needless to say, I expressed my discontent with the door person and we left to go to Woody's just up the street. We had to wait in line to get into Woody's but we entered for free, the place was decorated for the Halloween festivities, it was packed, ninety percent of the patrons were in costumes and we had a hoot.",

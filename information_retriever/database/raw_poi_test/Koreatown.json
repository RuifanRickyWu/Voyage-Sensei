When I was there during the evening, even the aroma of spicy Korean cooking was present! Both sides of the street was lined with Korean restaurants (and a few Japanese too), groceries and other trinklet stores. Other than the presence of English signages, one would easily take this place as in S Korea!"

        "Koreatown is a great neighbourhood for locals and visitors alike to explore in Toronto!  The Christie subway stop and the Bathurst subway stations are super convenient, and Little Italy, the Annex, and Bloorcourt neighbourhoods are all nearby.",
        "Here are a few of my favourite suggestions of places to check out (full disclaimer...I'm lucky enough to live in this neighbourhood):",
        "-Clinton's: great food (you can get pretty much everything vegetarian, including the gravy), dance parties on the weekend, and other special events like Choir, Choir, Choir, the World Cup, etc.",
        "-Buk Chang Dong Soon Tofu: Korean place across the street from Clintons (on the south side): In my opinion, definitely the best Korean restaurant on the street. There is often a line, but it moves quickly...but there are so many others to try too.",
        "-Tacos El Sador: everyone loves this place for authentic \"Mexican\" food - they are actually from El Salvador",
        "-Christie Pitts Park: great park for hanging out; there is a skating rink in the winter, this is where the Toronto Maple Leaf BASEBALL team plays (usually on Sundays, and always for free), a pizza oven that is used during festivals, a folk festival, a Korean festival, a Latino festival, the David Suzuki Foundation's Garrison Creek Walk, and so much more",
        "-P.A.T.: the Korean grocery store.  If you want a small taste of Korea this is a good taste; a great place to buy frozen dumplings, ginger ice cream, kimchee, and so so much more",
        "-Fish Waffles: inside the PAT.  There is no fish in these waffles, just yummy custard or sweet bean filling.  I think the red bean is most traditional, but most 'non-Korean Canadians' seem to like the custard. Get two, they are that good!",
        "-Pour Boys: just north of Bloor on Manning.  Super cheap, good drinks.  I think it is cash only.",
        "-Shopping: so many stores, lots of Korean ones with interesting stuff, but a few Latino ones opened up lately.  Check them all out.",
        "-Veggie markets: the one at Bloor and Manning is a destination.  Super cheap. There are a bunch of others too.",
        "-Qi: a natural food store (two actually: both on north side of the street, one just east of Christie, one just west of Bathurst).  These places give the natural food stores in Kensington a run for their money",
        "-Mirvish Village: on Markham south of Bloor.  A number of restaurants and other interesting stores. The Victory has a great patio and is a classic.",
        "-Kop's Records & Doug Miller Books: both awesome places to check out",
        "-Hodo Kwaja: Korean walnut cakes...a classic, as is the nearby Bubble Tea place",
        "-Sam James Coffee: their \"pocket\" location is on the north side of Bloor just east of Clinton.  This is another destination place.  Their larger, and original location, is on Harbord also just east of Clinton.",
        "-Honest Ed's: if you haven't been in before, go now.. It's slated to close Dec 2016 and is an icon of Toronto.  It's at the corner of Bloor & Bathurst.  There is a Wine Rack conveniently located here too.",

The Korean Village is the place for fancy but you can just as easily grab a bowl of pork bone soup in a more casual setting.  The locals are friendly and like to help.  Some interesting shops, especially the Japanese paper shop which sells some beautiful cards at ridiculously low prices.  Honest Ed's stands on the edge of the hood, a landmark, and maybe worth a visit.  P.A.T grocery store is also worth a stop....huge assortment of foodstuffs.  Pleasant hood for a stroll."

To my surprise there was and although it is only a few blocks long it is packed. A grocery store with a fish shaped bread stall there that is delicious!  We tried the custard and the green bean, both yummy!  A lot of different restaurants to choose from and a few cute stationary stores too. A hodo gwaja place that makes them on the spot and it is YUMMY. Would definitely visit again if in town. "

Great fun to browse through small boutiques and shops, tea houses and how about some Korean barbecue, kimchee, tofu soup, etc. Had a great lunch @ Kachi and some tea at the tea house nearby. One of the shops we found accidentally and fell in love right away was called \"Hanji\" selling loads of handmade paper goods and gifts. Everything was so cute and unique, and I picked up some cards and letter sets:)"

We had lunch at Mom's Korean Food because we noticed quite a few Korean people inside, and it was pretty good. We then had bubble tea and boong-uh-ppang (fish-shaped waffles with custard and red bean filling). Overall, visiting Koreatown made for a fun afternoon."

Korea apparently has a lot of spicy food so keep that in mind if you don't like that, but if you want Asian food or are into Asian culture I think you will like this better than China town."

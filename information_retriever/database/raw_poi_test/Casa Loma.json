  "description": "Built in 1914, this castle on a hill overlooking Toronto is regarded as a treasured heritage landmark. At Casa Loma, you can explore three levels of elaborately decorated rooms, including the Conservatory which has Italian marble floors and Ontario marble side panels. Permanent exhibitions and special exhibits here feature early Canadian history. The castle is also a popular place for private events, and serves as a backdrop for film and photo shoots. There's even a steakhouse located within the grounds offering the finest beef from all over the world. The tour of Casa Loma is self-guided but multimedia audio guides are available. – Tripadvisor",

The costumed actors who quietly crept after us, suddenly materialized, leered at us and jump-scared the heck out of us were the absolute best part. Far better than any Halloween walk-through we've been to at some major amusement parks!"

On the ground floor, the Library, the Conservatory and the Great Hall were memorable.  The second floor had many wonderful rooms.  The third floor was dedicated to Canadian military history and very interesting.  I did not go up to the towers.  I went back to the basement and ate lunch in the cafe.  There is a gift shop also.  I look forward to visiting Casa Loma again during the spring or summer."

Then above the stables you have celebrity wax works. Found it really bizzare. But was an ok visit. Not sure I would return."

This house is the most opulent and extravagant residence I have ever seen which isn’t a royal palace or the home of a member of the aristocracy.  It really is incredible and definitely worth a visit.  If the weather had been better, the views over the city from the towers would have been spectacular.  There is an audio tour which you can get on your phone so you can learn lots about this unique house."

Make the effort to go up the Scottish Tower for a panoramic view of Toronto, only best by CN Tower, Toronto Islands or Riverdale Park. The tunnel to the stables is also an interesting part of the visit. Alot of Toronto's history is also described throughout the tunnel and the house."

We continued waiting in line. A short time later we were directed to porta potties since the building was closed. We continued waiting in a very slow moving line. After 50 minutes in line, we were told there were no more tables. When we asked about having dinner, we were told we could go to a counter and get something to eat...I guess cafeteria style without anywhere to sit with our 'snack'.",
        "I realize processes sometimes change after a time...my complaint is that arriving 2.5 hrs ahead of the performance (this has always been more than enough time!) and then being met with a 'cattlecall' type of line up for hours! Portable toilets etc. It was a stark difference to the gracious experience we have enjoyed in the past. We had paid at this point and were not in a position for a refund. Meanwhile the event having used Casa Loma's name and grounds for crowd draw, denied access to said building and throughly cheapened the entire experience. In fact, it felt VERY much like without informing patrons of process change, they accepted money (over sold!) from patrons who didn't have a hope of having an (expensive) sit down meal without refund, filled their tables and made ALOT of money! Misleading at it's finest in my opinion!",

That leaves one person waiting around. That's not necessarily a bad thing, but having benches placed throughout the castle would definitely be helpful.  For example,  at the car garage, there's a  \"celebrity exhibit\" that requires you to walk up a spiral set of stairs.  I didn't go up, but my husband did.

        "A beautiful historic place is Casaloma. This place was awesome. It's pricey. The tip from my side please leave a lot of time to explore. We were here for most of the day. ",
        "There are several places where you can buy food and beverages on site. Prices were expensive, but portions were large. We explore everything including both towers and the underground tunnel area as well as the grounds. ",
        "The view from the tower where you can go outside is quite good. Casa Loma is a must-see when visiting Toronto. Car parking was quite difficult but I have a suggestion, people can go by public transport like subway and the station is Spadina. And Spadina station is the most beautiful subway station among Toronto. Public transport system is very smooth and easy."

        "This place was awesome. It's pricey, but we feel like we got our money's worth. Leave a lot of time to explore. We were here for most of the day. There are several places where you can buy food and beverages on site. Prices were expensive, but portions were large. There are a lot of people here, so sometimes areas get logjammed. We took our time and made sure to explore everything including both towers and the underground tunnel area as well as the grounds. The view from the tower where you can go outside is quite good. I will say that they are currently setting up for their Halloween event and small children might be scared by some of that, but it's limited to the tunnel and the ground, so it's fairly easy to avoid. In my opinion, Casa Loma is a must-see when visiting Toronto."

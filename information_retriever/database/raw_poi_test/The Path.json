There are several entrances and exits for each section, which bring you up to ground level. For the downtown core, you can certainly walk without wearing a jacket, provided you can enter from your hotel (not possible from all hotels).

        "On a rainy or windy day, the PATH is a good and safe option. It’s accessible by subway, streetcars and GO train. To/from Union station, you can cross into the subway underground through doors to the PATH that passes along eating areas and shops. It’s nothing like Sainte-Catherine Montreal or Seoul’s above-/below-ground mecca around Myeongdong or Gangnam; but York’s Fairmont Hotel also offers underground access to the PATH with storefronts (beside Hockey Hall of Fame on Front Street). Hairdressing/barber, services and cafes dot the subterranean landscape that meanders North—towards Queen Street, smack between Bay Street and University Avenue. For example, nearby the Hudson’s Bay, clients preregister for PhysioPlus (Pineapple) Health group for therapy, acupuncturist and more. You would first pop out at Nathan Phillips Square beside the municipal underground car/charging lot. They’re the stairs leading to the “new” City Hall (a.k.a. Superman buildings), where free Saturday-Sunday events are held seasonally, beside Old City Hall or the stone courthouse—adjacent to Eaton’s Centre. There, you can also find many more shops, across Yonge street from Dundas Square movie theatre (used mornings as a lecture hall by Toronto Metropolitan University students). Renovations are being completed along the PATH, just in time for their wintry escape from Toronto’s bustle and streetcar traffic! Timing it just right, you can emerge from the trains and do all your window shopping…then even catch a theatrical performance or musical/show at Four Seasons Centre for the Performing Arts. There are plenty of dining options, besides Ruth Chris’ Steakhouse, next to Sheraton hotel’s secret courtyard-garden on Queen: facing Shangri-la (for afternoon tea if Fairmont is fully booked). If you’re adverse to cold weather…practically never exposing your face to the elements, this could be the PATH for you. Strolling underground, downtown, how could anyone go wrong in a city like Toronto?!"

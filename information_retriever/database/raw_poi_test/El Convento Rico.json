If you don't know how to samba, you can pick up the basics at the Friday- and Sunday-night dance lessons, but if you don't learn, no one on the jam-packed dance floor will notice. There's a substantial hetero contingent that comes out just to watch the fabulous drag queens -- and don't be surprised if you encounter a bachelorette party in progress.",

        "I have never witnessed such a high level of respect for women and their safety while clubbing as I did tonight. I wish I had gotten his name but he was about 6 foot, of african american descent and more importantly an angel. He protected a group of women who were being harassed as though they were his own sisters and I can honestly say that his dedication to creating a safe place for women moved me. Never have I experienced such a high regard for a woman's safety, he was relentless in educating the men as to proper etiquette when approaching women and his actions tonight (friday December 20th) were commendable. Please recognize him for going above and beyond to make your female clients feel safe within the boundaries of your establishment. What a selfless and kind hearted man, hes truly an asset to your team."

        "After wasting 2 or 3 hours at the Church & Wellesley area going door after door looking for a nice place to stay for a few drinks, we decided to go west on College to El Convento Rico. The place is clean and spacious. Great dance music. Good door service & coat check.  BUT.... not a gay place anymore.   Lots and lots of very young girl groups dancing by themselves...  waiting for the drag shows to start.   Everybody seemed to be very open-minded and tolerant though....which is really good in 2018"

        "My best friend is getting married in the week, so we decided to do a night on the town  for her.  I asked her to pick a place she thought would be fun to go dancing.  Unfortunately she picked this place.  I've been to El Convento Rico before.  Experience's have always been okay in the past.  But last night was a disaster.  We got there at 10:45 PM.  As soon as we got there we noticed the staff aggressive and mean.  There were two people paying at the door a $15 cover charge, we stayed behind them and the bouncers quickly shoved us into a waiting line where there was literally no one waiting.  He kept us there for 10 minutes, and then allowed us to proceed to pay for our cover charges to go in.  I thought that was really weird for starters, considering there was no one in line in front of us and behind us.  We were the only ones there being held back.  I figured they did this because the club was full downstairs.  This place is in a basement.  After paying $45 for the three of us to go in I get to the bottom of stairs and there're less than 20 people in the club.  Right off the bat that started off as a warm welcome.  Then we made our way to the bar where we find out everything is cash, my friends have no money on them they only had credit cards and debit cards.  So I covered the first round of drinks.  The bartender was cocky and unkind.  I figured a $4 tip on $11 would soften him up a bit,",
        "But it didn't, not even a smile or thank you.  Then the place got loaded up, stuffy as hell.  The ratio of Spanish music to English music at one point was more than 2/3.  I went to the DJ and requested a song, he rolled his eyes like I was bothering him said he would play it and for the next hour And a half nothing happened no song.  After dancing for an hour and half it got so stuffy in that small overcrowded basement I could barely breathe. I needed some fresh air. So my friends and I decided to go outside for a breath of air.  God for bid you're smoker and want a smoke break.  I'm not, and neither of my 2 friends.  We get outside we take a five minute breather.  Only to find out that we have to get into a re-line to get back in.  The line for people with stamps to reenter on their hands was enormous.  I counted over 40 people waiting to get back in, on the other side of the door, they had the people waiting to buy tickets to get in.  The bouncers let 10 of those in to collect there $15, then would allow two to reenter on our side.  After waiting 45 minutes, missing the drag queen show that we originally came for we gave up and left the club.  We were nowhere near entry after 45 minutes of waiting.  They held us there like cattle.  Not one staff member was polite.  What a waste of $45 and a night.  It really ruined it for my friend.  She really had her heart  set on watching the show.  Toronto is full of amazing clubs I wish we had picked another one.  I would suggest staying away from this place.  There're so many nice clubs in Toronto.  With really nice classy stuff.  This one is definitely the lower end.  They're only there to take your money they don't care if you have a good time.  I've been to this place at least a half a dozen times.  Experiences in The past have always been mediocre.  This experience is the one that has made me decide to never go back there again.  I will tell all my friends the same."

        "We reserved a table with bottle service and would recommend this option as it gives you and your guests a reserved spot to sit while you're not dancing.  The atmosphere is friendly.  Fortunately, we arrived early enough to take part in the dancing lessons; while we're not all coordinated it was good fun.  The MC and DJ ensure it's a lively beat all night long.  The drag queen show that happens at 1a is very entertaining.  It's loud and fun all night long.   A mix of legal ages, a variety of dress - wear what you want. "

It has divolved into a typical \"meat-market\"; great for the owners, but the ambiance of what made it a great club are now gone.",

People really dressed up to casual, younger to older, male and female, gay and straight. Very unpretentious. Queens are super friendly and the music playing was awesome!! We had bottle service in a back booth and had a great night dancing the night away. This is not a fancy, chic club and doesn't pretend to be. Male review was AMAZING and the drag show was pretty cool too! This is a great night out if you come with the right attitude! "

        "Came here last week although I wasn't sure what to expect given that most of the reviews were pretty dated. The atmosphere was pretty relaxed with very few pretentious Torontonians. Most people there just seemed to want to have a good time. There were two bars: one serving top shelf liquor and the other selling relatively inexpensive drinks. Music cycled between a variety of Latin genres and top 40. Apparently there was an almost naked man performing around 1030 before I got there. It was supposedly X-rated in that he was dancing very sexually with a hard-on. I didn't see it do I really can't say much more than that. The drag show was fun in that it involved the audience but was short-lived and really nothing special compared to some others I've seen on Church Street. All-in-all a fun, low-key club. "

        "They advertise the best time of your life for stagettes, they promise your stagette will get attention, they ask you to provide a photo, and her name and they promise when you bring your girl here she'll have a ball. I would have got more attention if I had a willy. They certainly made a huge production with any males that were there (not that any of them are getting married). ",

I was at the edge of the circle formed for the drag show and he kept yelling at me to move back. \"Where am I going to go?\" I had a pack of people behind me that also wouldn't move. He didn't care, and came back four times telling me to move!",
        "What did happen was a very lady-man came out and mentioned during her intro that someone was getting married. 'Someone' was about four women there that night, and apparently they didn't know who we were - even though we were all wearing mucho big signs that said we're brides-to-be.",
        "That was when we finally got in. We had a reservation, and at any other club this would mean a VIP entrance. Nope. For $40 we got to wait for 45 minutes while they let in every other tom dick and harry before us. ",
        "Evidently, the promoters and the staff aren't communicating. ",
        "When we got in and finally saw the show - which lasted a whopping 30 minutes, we took our overpriced drinks to the side and tried to have our girls night out. ",
        "You could look at what happened next as a good or a bad thing but it was near on impossible to have a girls night out when every single girl in the group was getting hit on almost military style by a stream of short ugly men - some of whom wouldn't take no for an answer. The creme of the crop - the security guard: I thought he was giving my girl-friend trouble. but no, he was taking his job to the next level and hitting on her just to make sure she had an extra good time. ",

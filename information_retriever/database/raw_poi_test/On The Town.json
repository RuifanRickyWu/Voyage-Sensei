        "Jane Herman led me and my Australian friends through several of Toronto's downtown neighborhoods in a 4 hour food crawl that left us satisfied physically and intellectually. She described the history of the neighborhoods and the particular restaurants we visited (5 different ethnicities, all delicious). We sampled foods from the Middle East, Japan, China, Thailand and Ethiopia (and took home plenty for dinner and lunch the next day!) and ended with pastries right by Little Trinity Church. Jane picked us up with a driver so we never had to worry about getting anywhere or parking and we all had a fantastic time. I can't recommend this food crawl highly enough!"

She was knowledgeable and had an fun, easy-going personality. I got exactly what I was looking for on this 90 min tour, culminating in a fresh-market brunch fit for kings; awesome! Highly recommend; ask for Jane."

        "I recently took a Distillery District tour with On the Town Tours. When scheduling the tour, Jane was very helpful and flexible with our schedule as well as willing to tailor to our interests. Upon meeting Jane, she is very friendly and welcoming. The tour was very informative, and it was great to see some of the older buildings in the city, and learn some of the history behind the building of the city. Our tour consisted of my boyfriend and myself, which made it more personal. It was also nice to go at our own pace, and not be to rushed. Jane allowed for extra time at various sites to get pictures and check out a few smaller museums. Jane gave a great tour and was a wealth of knowledge on the area. The Distillery District itself is beautiful and definitely a great place to explore. If you're looking for a good tour I would highly recommend On the Town Tours."

I was really struck by the variety of buildings in Toronto when I visited recently to attend a convention so was delighted to find that On the Town offer short walking tours on just this topic, with the very knowledgeable Jane.  I learned lots about the history of the development of this beautiful city and about different architectural styles as exemplified by the many individual skyscrapers and other municipal buildings constructed here over the past hundred and fifty years."

        "Our tour of \"Old Town and the Distillery District\" with Jane was illuminating and fun! As a historian, I've toured historic districts across the globe. The personal touch that Jane gave to our tour put her at the top of my list. When rain was expected, she emailed before and offered a change of day or to drive—that's the type of personal attention she gives her tour guests. We started at the historic St. Lawrence Market where we perused old photos of the city and she provided background information on Toronto's history. Stops included: the Gooderham Building (Flatiron building), warehouses by St. Lawrence, St. James Anglican Church, a former courthouse (now restaurant), Bank of Upper Canada, De LaSalle Institute, a post office, Corktown, Little Trinity Church, Enoch Turner Schoolhouse, and the brick streets and redeveloped buildings of the Distillery District. Jane was incredibly knowledgeable and I appreciated how she took our pulse, so to say, and would gear her talk to subjects that we found most interesting. A fount of knowledge, no question I asked went unanswered (and I ask a lot of questions). She is a consummate professional with an excellent understanding of architectural and social history. I hope to return to Toronto and take another one of Jane's tours."

She also conveys a pride and affection for her city.  I've lived in Toronto my whole life and yet I learned a great deal about the history of this important area and the people who shaped the development over time.  I can imagine enjoying this tour in all the seasons -- so lovely to explore a lakeside part of TO.  ",

She is very knowledgeable about history and architecture and very pleasant company.   I am a Toronto resident and I was interested to see all the changes in recent years and pleased to see how good the city looks from this perspective - as opposed to from the Gardiner Expressway in gridlock.  Ordinarily Janes Waterfront tour is a little longer (time and distance) and runs from west to east. However she easily accommodated our schedule and location to make the tour work for us.  Thank you Jane!"

In fact, she manages to pass on her enthusiasm to her audience during the interesting walks she guides. My husband and I registered for two different walks, and one of them was for free! Actually, Jane is so much into her walks and the city that she not only had this one free tour through the newly revitalized Queens Quay but told us she would be also offering free tours during the oncoming Pan Am Games. Congratulations for your fine work, Jane, and do hope you keep on!"

We took so many photos, and the views of the falls were fantastic. We had plenty time to ourselves before leaving on time. Really great value trip; you should definitely consider doing this tour and with this operator. Thank you for an amazing day!"

Firstly, none of us seemed to mind them. So I don't understand why he repeatedly said this as each caucasian joined the van at the beginning. I just smiled awkwardly. Like why is race such a big thing?",
        "2. At the very beginning of the trip, he mentioned to the whole group a quick anecdote about how asians usually don't tip but recently 2 hong kong ladies were so impressed by him that they gave him $100 and he's hoping to get high tips again from the hong kong group (family of 4; coincidentally there were also 2 asian ladies (not sure what country; probably thai or viet in the van). Just rubbed me the wrong way.",
        "3. He gave free candies to the group emphasizing that \"this did not come from my boss; it came from me\". Literally just candies candies. Not even water or anything fancier but he had to let us know for him to get tips.",
        "4. At night, he gave out postcards. One for each. Except for the hong kong group which he initially only wanted to give 1. He asked how many they want, one of them said 4 (one for each family member) but he only gave them 2. Like, dude, you were asking for a huge tip at the beginning of the trip but you are so stingy with those cheap-ass postcards? Why??",
        "5. Had a miscommunication with an american couple who were part of the group and he broadcasted their whole story (and how they were crying and distraught) to the whole group while the couple were not yet there. That is soooo unprofessional. We didn't need to know what happened. Just say there's been a miscommunication. End of story.",
        "He really didn't explain much about the places or interacted with us. I feel like maybe he's not trying because the group has more asians than caucasians (but the asians seem to be able to understand and speak english perfectly). No enthusiasm at all.",
        "To the management, I'm sure you will be defensive (as I see in your replies to other less-than-positive reviews) and say that Adam Nice is a veteran tour guide with many many positive reviews - what I'm sharing is my experience so please don't try to discredit or disregard it. I hope to see some accountability and true commitment in training your tour guides to be more professional and more sensitive to other cultures.",

        "This company is a scam.  They have several different names and change their name and address frequently to avoid bad reviews.  They go as PBRT, Paramount Party Bus, and Park Lane Livery.  ",
        "We had an extremely unfortunate series of events  that ended with us not making it to our final destination, and the company would only offer us a $100 credit to use on our NEXT TRIP (which would never happen).",
        "First, the driver arrived at my home, and immediately asked me for payment, without even getting out of the vehicle to introduce himself.  He handed me the debit machine through the drivers side window. I asked him about the deposit that I had already paid, and he said that I had not, and then told me that I needed to call.  I said ok, and called to clarify.  Clarification was received and there was no problem.  However, he continued to argue with my guests and create a scene.  My husband, who was not even on the wine tour with us, had to ask him to keep it down, as the discussion of finance was becoming embarrassing to us in front of our guests.  Then he said ‘they can get in’, but would not get out and open the door for them until I asked him to.  There was no ice or glassware in the limo so i went into my home to get my own.  While we were all ready to depart at 9:30, it was nearly 10 by the time we were able to leave.",
        "It gets worse.",
        "We arrived at our first stop, Red Stone Winery, and he continued to be argumentative regarding the charge and the glassware.  We told him it was not a big deal and we wanted to enjoy our day, but he kept at us.  He picked us up from there with no problem, except that once we got back in the limo we sat there for 10 minutes as he tried to set his GPS.  This happened at each spot.",
        "Then we went to Vineland Estates.  He told me to text him when we were 15 minutes away.  I gave him a 5 minute heads up.  15 minutes later, he was nowhere close to the door.  Two of our guests have a hard time walking long distances.  I had to walk out to the far parking lot to ask him to come pick us up at the door.",
        "We went for lunch at Ravine Winery.  I gave him a 15 min heads up as well.  We were standing by the limo waiting for him when we came out.  Several minutes (10). later, he came out of the winery with a coffee and started to argue with us.  He was very disrespectful,  and said that I had not texted him, which indeed i had...three times.  He said ‘why don’t you call me?’’  I said I was disappointed with the service.  I asked him to simply be ready to go when we were ready to go.",
        "We went to Gretzky’s winery, and then walked over to Trius.  He was supposed to pick us up at Gretzky’s But our guests could not do the walk back so I CALLED him and asked him to pick us up at Trius at 4:05.  He parked in the back of the winery, instead of where the rest of the limos were parked.  We waited for him, and texted, and called, and finally he brought the car around front.  We did not leave there until 4:20 or later.  He then sat behind a parked car for several minutes before realizing it was not going to move, got on the road, and we sat in traffic for nearly 45 minutes.  He took the road that crosses the Welland canal.  When the bridge finally lowered, he missed the on-ramp for the highway (only noticing when we told him), and had to cut into a plaza and turn around.  My GPS had us getting back to Mississauga by 5:30.  By 5:30 we were not even in Burlington.",
        "All of this would have been forgiven, except for the incident on the road.  We were travelling at about 90kph on the QEW, when suddenly out of nowhere, the car came to a screeching halt.  Half of our guests, most of whom are in their 60’s and 70’s, went flying from the back to the front.  (There were only two operational seatbelts in the limo).  There were no other cars anywhere near us, and no reason why he should have slammed on the breaks.  It was evident then that he had either fallen asleep or was SERIOUSLY distracted.  He was on his phone the entire day…including while driving.  He then pulled onto the shoulder and continued driving, asking if everyone was ok.  He drove on the shoulder for about a kilometre, even as I begged him to get back on the road as it was very dangerous to drive at that speed on the shoulder for that long.  ",
        "He then began videotaping us in the back of the limo with his phone, as my sister pleaded with him to get off his device.  He argued with her.  My aunt felt so sick from being thrown, she needed to find a washroom.  He then recorded himself into his phone saying ‘ It’s 5:34 and I’m being asked to stop for a washroom’.",
        "We decided then that we needed to get out of the limo and find another way home.  Not only was this driver dangerous, but he was volatile, argumentative, and unstable.  Several people in the limo had back pain from being tossed around.  ",
        "He continued to argue with us in the parking lot, saying that he had been taking pictures of the bridge that was closed…and that our guests, if they are sick, should have taken a different limousine company.  I told him that we were very disappointed, that the situation became dangerous, and that we came out to have a nice day and I was not going to argue with him but would contact the company.",
        "He then went inside the restaurant that we had stopped at so my aunt could use the washroom, and he asked the hostess if we had reservations. ???  We were stranded in Burlington and he was essentially accusing us of planning this!  My husband had to make two trips out to Burlington to pick us all up.",
        "H.D was inattentive, lazy, rude, argumentative and very dangerous on the road. He left us shaken up, upset, and angry.  A beautiful day at the wineries…a once in a lifetime experience for family members here from Europe…was completely ruined by this terrible driver."

        "We had arranged to have the Party Bus people  come to Sheet Harbour early Friday morning July 19th and transport 20 people to and from the Scotiabank Centre, Friday to Sunday. That arrangement was made in December 2018. Deposit of $700 was  made to gaurentee the dates for our bus with last contact with Party Bus employee June 2019. ",
        "Friday morning at the arranged pickup time all 20 people were assembled at the pickup place. 6:15 AM. No bus. No word from the management of the Party Bus. A brief msg cancelling the bus was left on our phone after midnight the the day before."

        "I should mention first that I actually did not see the bus or sat in it, and the comments I am providing here were actually from my guests who were on the bus.",
        "We rented the bus that fits 56 people. I have booked it as a good gesture for our parents and the people who came from overseas (New Zealand, Europe, USA). The guests have paid thousands of dollars just to be with us on that day, so I wanted to make sure they feel so comfortable and so welcomed by us. This is why I decided to get a  bus for them. Additionally, we had people that actually cannot drive, including people who are more than 80 years old and one stage 4 cancer patient.",
        "It was a hot day in Toronto. We only had 45 people so the bus wasn’t filled to capacity. My guests mentioned that the AC wasn’t working at all, as there was no air coming out of the AC unit. My guests were dripping sweats and sadly, all our efforts that have gone into the ladies hair and makeup prior to the bus times have gone down the drain, as we had to bring makeup people and hairdressers in-house again after they came back to the house and the hotel to re-do everything, which costed everyone a lot of dollars.",
        "My guests were telling me they were so worried about the cancer patient as his face started turning yellow because he couldn’t handle the heat. Fortunately, he was okay at the end, but as you can see...from my end, it is really embarrassing and so sad. The cancer patient is my wife’s uncle and he came from Michigan to celebrate with us. I wanted him to feel great on the wedding day.",
        "On top of that, I heard from my parents that the driver gave an attitude when people were inquiring about the AC unit, which is really not acceptable. My people came all the way from New Zealand and UK and paid around 2000 per ticket just to get here. Also, as you know wedding times are very stressful for the parents, so feeling not appreciated is the last thing I want to hear from them. Maybe the driver did not mean it this way, but yea I am not sure what happened!",
        "I know that this bus company has good reputation, I have read some good reviews, and that is why I went ahead and booked the bus with them trusting that the company will provide amazing service to my family and relatives. Unfortunately, all the comments I heard were negative and terrible. Some even mentioned that the bus is the only wrong thing that we did on the wedding day, which was very embarrassing to me, considering that I wanted to make guests feel comfortable and put them to ease so they don’t have to worry about driving or Ubering to destinations.",
        "I have never given a negative feedback before in my life, so this really is a first for me, and I am not used to this. But I felt that this should be heard, as I felt very sad hearing about that! Being in the transport business is never easy, and the bus companies flourish from customer service and word of mouth. I felt like my wife and I were entitled for a refund for a service that was not up to the standard. The first thing I asked for before I signed the contract is to have a functional AC and Paramount assured me that it will be working. That was not the case unfortunately. The company even refused to give us a full refund for the terrible service, which is very unprofessional! They only authorized $200 refund, which is borderline pathetic!",
        "On a positive note, the bus was on time, and the schedule was flawless! So thanks for that."

        "I feel that the company creates an expectation while hiding behind the contract terms when they do not deliver. READ THE TERMS VERY CAREFULLY.  I was advised that the bus with the PS4 was reserved for me 2 days before the rental date.  Instead of notifying me of any changes the  bus was delivered without  the gaming console.  When I tried to escalate, they advised that I had to contact the owner on Monday- two days later.  The bus was dark and not suitable kids.  At a  cost $740, I expected more that just a school bus with a paint ceiling.  As well,  the bus was properly maintained.  This bus smelled of carbon monoxide during our hour drive there and back.  Since the bus was not exclusive to us, when the driver came to pick us up at our location, there were pink and purple balloons which would not be bad if it was my daughter's birthday and not my sons.  There is definitely a lack of attention to details and customer service."

        "Initially after looking at the website a week ago, the prices for a party bus were about $15  a person for two party buses. A week, I called to book these exact same buses, but was greeted with a price of an EXTRA $25 PER PERSON! After explaining this to the customer service representative, he denied these claims. It was only until told him we had screenshots of the website from a week before that he came up with a long-winded excuse about fine-print in the disclaimer stating that the prices did not apply during 'prom season'. He claimed it was in the disclaimer on the new website as well, and after scrolling to the bottom of the page to find it, these conditions did not exist within the words. The customer service provider told me to move on and that it didn't matter anyways because the prices were 'all booked up', even though when I initially called they had a multitude of buses available. I expressed my confusion regarding the topic and told the guy on the other line that I would be making a bad review about the incident. He told me to \"watch what I did\" because he could make sure that I didn't get a bus anywhere else. All in all, I would NOT RECOMMEND! VERY poor customer service, and sketchy prices and fine print!"

        "This is the 2nd time I have used the Party Bus rental Services. The first was for my 40th birthday and this past weekend we used their services again for my daughters 16th birthday. Both times we had the Circus bus. It was absolutely amazing. They played the music we wanted and the laser light show was outstanding!!!!. The party started the moment we got of the bus and continued at our destination and again when we were picked back up. Our Driver Chris arrived on time and the Customer Service the staff provided with booking and confirming was impressive! The bus was super clean and everyone was so amazed the moment we stepped on the bus. If you want a worry free ride with exceptional service then contact the Party Bus rental service! They consistently provide customer service excellence and the bus is so amazing for everyone of all ages!!!! This was an experience to remember."

        "It is a shame one is not allowed to give a no star review.  Went to see a taping of the CBC show, The Debaters.  It was an enjoyable experience except for the fact that I could NOT sit down.  The seats are so tiny that the distance from my butt to my kneecap was significantly longer than the distance from the back of my seat to the back of the next one.  Additionally, the seats have rigid cup holders that cut your leg just below the knee.  I DON'T FIT.  That might be okay for 15 minutes but not for 3 hours.  Why 3 hours? Because all those complaints in other reviews about misleading start times are true.  The comments about the quality and behavior of the staff and \"security\" in those other reviews remain true.  THIS IS A GREAT PLACE TO AVOID.  Drive to Hamilton to see your show.  You will be a lot happier."

However ALL water is made to be dumped out before entering. Doesn’t make sense does it-  we’re not getting on a plane here!!  But it does once you get in and have to pay $4 for a small bottle of water!!!!   Now I get it - it’s called gouging!  So I caved and purchased only to find out from another irate patron that if you ask they’ll kindly bestow upon you a cup of tap water. Maybe that could have been offered when I purchased by over priced bottle of tap water???   The venue is filthy. The women’s washroom was disgusting. The paint is peeling. There were holes in the walls (my seat was in the balcony and holes were visible if I looked up) the seat were uncomfortable, etc.   ",
        "All I can say is that is you are going to gouge me $4 for water maybe the venue should reflect that type of price point. Niagara in the Lake theatres don’t  gouge you  $4 for water.    Good thing the music was excellent because nothing else was."

        "For context, I’m a male smoker, so I spent quite a bit of time outside near the front entrance to the venue for the New Years celebration with the band Dwayne Gretzky. I watched over and over as ALL of the security staff took turns kicking women out of the concert that they paid good money to attend. It was always under the guise of intoxication, but there wasn’t a SINGLE time where I saw this to be the case. They had a portable toilet set up outside with a shaky railing leading up the short stairway to the restroom doors. I watched men completely stumble down the stairs over and over again due to the railing giving out, and initially had this problem myself, but god forbid if you did this in HEELS! Over and over again this staff ignored occasions of actually drunk guys and targeted females who “talked back” upon hearing that their $80 night was over before the stroke of 12:00. They were LOOKING to kick people out, and they did it to so many women who had no business being ejected from a venue. It was gross. I watched the female security guard actually yell at a woman who had the audacity to WASH HER HANDS in the portable restroom! She told the young woman that she couldn’t wash her hands because they needed to keep the line moving and that she should “finish washing her hand in the water fountain outside”. WTF!!???? Again, this was in plane view of the front of the venue where they had the portable restroom truck setup, so the security displayed no shame in choosing power over the sanitation and health of the venue’s patrons.

If there is a show that you want to see there I would recommend going as it is an opportunity to get up close and personal.

I use an upright walker, wheelchair or brace crutch for mobility and in the past, we have purchased tickets in the balcony as I need to sit for the majority of the show. We were aware that the venue did not have an elevator to balcony. Last night I had used my upright walker which my husband planned on carrying up to the balcony while I used my crutch to tackle the stairs. I was very pleased when a security guard offered and escorted us to an area on the floor, side stage with a barrier and pulled out a folding chair for myself. I can’t begin to tell you how wonderful it was to be able to see the stage, not get shoved around and to be able to sit for the entire concert!  The Security Staff even cleared a path for us to leave the hall once the concert was over. Thank you Danforth Music Hall for having a plan to assist patrons with mobility devices and to the Security Staff for going above and beyond. We will Definitely be back!"

If we would have purchased based upon the time that we needed, it would have cost us over $40.

        "Attended on a Thursday night for a rock show. Parking was a bit sparse as both nearby Green P lots were full, but ended up finding the lot at Loblaws around the corner for $5.",
        "The general admission section has a sightly sloped floor and was perfect for us. The balcony section was more of a distance from the stage than I imagined. Drinks are served on both the west/east side of floor. Restrooms were fair condition. Egress was a bit bottlenecked with only a couple options but cleared reasonably quick. ",
        "Sound quality was better than expected and overall nothing flashy but good venue for a show."

        "I called the Music Hall with what I thought was a pretty simple question and never was able to talk to anyone there.  I called their listed  number morning, afternoon, and evening and always got the same recording, with no opportunity to leave a voice message. I sent an e-mail inquiry, as suggested on the recording, again with no reply.  I then called another phone number I found on their website, again with no answer.  Finally, I sent individual e-mails to both the General Mgr. and Assistant Mgr - no one has replied.  This is terrible customer service - they obviously don't care about their customers once they get the money for the tickets."

        "Just saw two historic Canadian bands at the Danforth Music Hall, which remains my favourite venue to see a show in Toronto. The venue size, google estimate says it holds 1500, allows for a biggest small show in Toronto feel. As the floor in front of the very large stage being on an incline makes viewing the performers super easy to maneuver to get a good view. I was able to walk right up to the front of the stage as the open layout of the venue (no seats on the main level) allows for easy walkings to get a beer/use the washroom even when crowded. The sound was great for each rock act that came on and as was announced at another show I attended, the venue appears to have a hard-stop at 11:00 pm so the acts came on promptly at 8 and 9:15 respectively. It created a nice energized vibe as no one was struggling with a long night and the sound was crisp. Would definitely recommend."

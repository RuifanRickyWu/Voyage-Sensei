      "text": [
        "Sherway Garden is an underrated mall. It might be smaller than Square One, but it’s not as noisy or chaotic. Yorkdale is more accessible by transit, but Sherway Garden has a lot going for it inside. The restaurants and food court may be one factor, below, which makes it a better meeting place than Shops at Don Mills, Eaton’s Centre, Hillcrest, or Fairview. I like the cleanliness of Sherway Garden, which seems to attract more seniors (not as many as Bayview Village), compared to Yorkdale. It has a Sephora (& Mac) like Fairview and a wide range of mid- to high-priced stores like Yorkdale (H&M, Harry Rosen, Tory Burch/Kate Spade, namebrand accessories); British folks would like this mall. It didn’t have as much in terms of interior decor and mom appeal…but it’s much better and bigger than Centerpoint or Shoppes on Steeles for meeting friends. I prefer parking at P3 outside HBC where it’s calmer beside the Bay entrance. There’s also parking in front of Joey’s, freshii, Cactus Club, and Keg’s. Although Yorkdale food court has a mostly unused patio, I like how airy Sherway feels; its upper food court that was added with skylight wraps around Sporting Life/Gap to the new Indigo location, which has an excellent kids’ books section. (It makes up for the lack of a theatre.) I didn’t see as much bubble tea offered; but there’s Cookies and Amaya facing Chipotle or Bourbon Grill, near the escalators to the sushi bar. Stores are being introduced downstairs by Crepe de licious, which is another healthy alternative, unless you need gluten-free options like Thai and Jimmy the Greek’s. The one down side of Sherway is its figure 8 layout, which can be difficult for people who tend to get lost. If you need a pay-stroller, park in the South-side (rear) by the Shoppers Drug Mart and ask at the Customer Service Desk for directions. Dads might be obliging to offer teens a ride, so they can head across N. Queensway to check out Home Depot. There’s something for the whole family around Queensway or the QEW if you’re patient enough to walk & look. Sherway is conveniently situated between Mississauga and Etobicoke (Kipling-Dundas miway in Toronto). I would recommend Sherway Garden as a place to enjoy on a rainy day, but don’t expect a simple map /layout on your first visit. Meet friends and have fun shopping without the stress!"

Many restaurants from which to choose and a very clean and bright food court with lots of choices. I might find it helpful to have a compass as I try to navigate it’s layout, but going in circles led to some neat discoveries. Lots of areas to sit, rest re charge your phone ( or yourself).

Norstrom and Saks Fifth, while nice, is so overly priced. The Bay has no staff most of the time. I only come here if I must, as there's no place to sit at Sherway and the Food Court is off to one side with a confusing path. Outside parking is congested and confusing, in particular with the stop signs. Twice, people almost got into a car accident due to the confusing stop signs at each of the entrances to the mall."

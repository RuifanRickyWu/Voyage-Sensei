        " I absolutely love the massages that I get each month from  RT, Angel. In addition to my 90 minute massage, Angel also does cupping, which has really helped my lung and coughing problems.  Her massages are so relaxing and healing, especially with my 2 injuries. My husband is now going for massages and cupping.",

I would definitely recommend her to anyone. 5 star experience hands down."

        "Last week, on a whim, I decided I really needed a massage so I looked around and saw great google reviews for this boutique spa near my old apartment. I gave them a call mid day and they were able to fit me in right away. When I arrived I was greeted warmly by the concierge and offered water before heading straight into the room (I didnâ€™t have much time before the appointment time otherwise I would have enjoyed the relaxation time in the waiting room). The waiting area offers infused water and snacks if you have time before and everyone wears some sandals around the old and well maintained Victorian house itâ€™s in. ",
        "I saw Carmen for a 45 neck and back massage but it was so much more than that - the title does it no justice except as a descriptor! Carmen gave me probably the BEST RMT massage Iâ€™ve ever had. I had a lot of tightness in my calves and neck and she really worked those areas. The normal sort of pain and sometimes even a light bruise I have received in other massages with good pressure to loosen things up was not there and yet I was relaxed, felt looser and re-energized when I finished. Carmen used some eucalyptus(I think) aroma therapy during various parts of the message. The bed was lined with a heated blanket that just added to the relaxation. She did an amazing scalp and neck massage (massaging the neck area often makes me a little nervous but it was nice). The room was nicely lit with blinds that blocked just enough light for a darkened room but letting some natural light in. A small thing for me was that she didnâ€™t try to talk the whole time, which was nice because the last RMTs Iâ€™ve had wanted to talk the whole time and it took away some of the relaxation. Carmen was amazing and used some different techniques that I hadnâ€™t experienced before and did it all with care, good pressure and softness. The warm towels to remove some of the massage oil used on my back was another nice touch. ",
        "I canâ€™t wait to go and book another massage here!"

        "After an amazing massage the treatment continued with acupuncture needles and that is where my body really settled and relaxed.  While the massage felt good the combination of acupuncture and massage really had me feeling like a changed person afterwards.",
        "My entire body felt so much more relaxed and at ease in a way that is hard to describe I continued to feel the effect over the rest of the day.  If you can try this place out."

It is worth the few extra dollars compared to a more in and out massage clinic or physio place. ",

I have had Juan Carlos massage me on several other occasions and itâ€™s always an amazing experience. He is the best therapist in the city as far as Iâ€™m concerned. I have been working out a lot lately and have had some shoulder and hip issues which he was able to help me with. Both feel much better after the session. I walked out feeling limber, rested and relaxed. Iâ€™ll be back again soon. "

Much more powerful than Reiki.  This is such an amazing little spa in the heart of Toronto. From what I understand this little place is where the influencers of Toronto all go for their treatments. The owner Juan Carlos is also the best massage therapist I have ever encountered and it seems that the elite of Toronto have discovered him as well. And the prices are extremely reasonable. Thanks HealFlow.  "

The attention to detail is obvious: the place is spotlessly clean, the scents and sounds are soothing, the massage tables are heated, the linens are soft, and the massage itself is simply the best I have ever had!  Being a very active person, I have had many massages over the years.  Juan Carlos has the ability to hone in on all of my knots, even the ones I didn't know were there!",

        "From a friends recommendation, I visited this cute little three story spa in Toronto. From the minute I walked in, I knew it would be great. A beautiful lemongrass smell and soft music was everywhere. I was met by the owner Juan Carlos who has worked on celebs around the world in the best five star hotels before opening his own hotel lace. He has magic hands. The facilities are basic but extra clean and well maintained which is what I liked. I had a amazing relaxing massage followed by a facial peel my skin is glowing. He is not a RMT but he does have some working there for those who need insurance receipts. This place is going to be difficult to get into once everyone discovers it. Highly recommend to try it. "

        "I am not from Toronto, but I eat dinner here seriously every time I am in town, and they make the best burger at any restaurant I’ve been to. The koreatown is my go-to! Can’t stress it enough: amazing burgers!! Not to mention, the beer selection is actually really great. There’s always something from one of my favourite breweries, like an Elora sour. Ugh, amazing! Thanks so much Tallboys. Always a fun and welcoming environment. Also — trivia nights!! So fun. "

        "This was a first visit for me. I’m a regular visitor to Toronto to watch hockey and other sports. I always plan my visits methodically and this time managed to find the time to travel to and visit Tallboys.",
        "From downtown it’s about 15-20 minutes on the subway, but don’t let that put you off.",
        "When you get off the subway it’s only a few minutes’ walk. It’s quite an unassuming place so take care you don’t walk past, as a I did.",
        "My visit was prior to a Leafs game, so I got in at opening time which is 4pm.",
        "It was only me in there plus the owner and 1 of the bar staff.",
        "The selection is quite large – as you’d expect, mostly Tallboys in the fridge. However, I decided to try some of the draught ales they had on and they were really very good.",
        "I also decided to have some food and it just happened that the day I was in the burgers were on the special. I’d read so much about how good these were I decided to try them. I’d skipped lunch earlier in the day so was hungry too. Well I’m glad I listened to all the great reviews and suggestions. It was without doubt the best burger I have had anywhere! It was pretty big and with the obligatory fries set me up for a few more beers. ",
        "I decided to stick to the draught ales and had 3 in the end (pints) along with my burger. I sat at the bar chatting away to the 2 people in there (who were great people too) and I could have stayed in much longer. When it comes to great beer and food V The Leafs, then no matter how good it is the hockey will always win out so I had to cut my visit short.",
        "Unfortunately, my itinerary for the rest of my stay meant I didn’t get chance to go out there again, but it is now firmly on my list of places to visit every time I’m in T.O.",
        "If you don’t believe all the hype about how good a beer and burger could be, go try for yourself. Just like me you’ll soon realise it’s all correct. It’s a shame it’s not closer to downtown but don’t let that put you off either. A short journey on the TTC and you’ll soon be there to go and check it out.",
        "Finally, thanks for the great company on my visit to the 2 who spent their time chatting to me. Oh, and thanks for recommending the burger………………."

        "A wonderful array of local craft beer attracted us to this spot which is located between  Christie Pits and the emerging but not bouchie Ossington and Bloor.  It has a casual atmosphere with well placed some televisions  - not so dominating that you would ever call this a sports bar.  The staff is friendly in the way of a neighbour who is familiar but who hasn't been introduced.  The beer selection is unbelievable.  A word about the food.  Bar food can be very routine and satisfying, but it is such a pleasure when the kitchen is actually producing bar food with the appropriate amount of reverence - when this happens, the food tastes like home cooking and not simply a bar menu habitué.  The food was very good.  I had the pulled pork sandwich - delicious.  The side salad was actually a really nice salad and not simply a garnish disguised as a sandwich."

Not a negative thing, you get first hand impressions of other craft beers and a peek at the menu items up close. Want to try a beer but not sure if you'll like it?  The waiter/owner happily brought us three smaller glasses to share a beer between us. The folks here really know their beers and there are a lot of choices so be prepared to ponder the menu for a while. Ok so now you're hungry, check out the menu, simple stuff like burgers; extraordinary burgers! We had the bleu burger with sweet potato fries and highly recommend it. Again our waiter/owner blew us away, no frozen patty here folks, local butcher (across the street) provides the ground beef and he's a picky butcher so you're getting great quality. Home made in house and prepared fresh to order makes the difference, not \"just a burger\". We left full and satisfied and promised to return, friendly knowledgeable staff/owners, great food and a huge beer selection await folks, give it a try!"

You really can't go wrong with anything on the menu though."

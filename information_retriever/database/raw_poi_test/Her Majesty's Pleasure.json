Which is not how I think a customer based business should be. Not sure I’ll ever come back even though I really like Palak."

The staff were lovely - Kevin did an amazing job with my haircut and wanted to make sure I was comfortable with my hair plan. Palak gave a great relaxing massage. Jenny was super nice and she did a great job on my pedicure. And I LOVE Amanda- she's done my manicures twice and have been amazing both times. She's also super upbeat and really cares and is great to talk to!  Will definitely make her my go to for nails! Lauren was great at the front desk: she checked in on me several times throughout the day, helped me still get my appointments when I was late stuck in traffic, and I witnessed her deal with a Karen- bless Lauren's soul for that.

        "I am SO disappointed with my sister's bachelorette at Her Majesty's Pleasure.  It's not clear on the website, nor through our multiple correspondence emails, that it's primarily a nail salon.  I wish whomever had been helping me with the booking would have made it crystal clear that there's only ONE room for extra treatments.  It's silly to think that we would wait while one person had a facial/scrub etc for 90 minutes and then the next person would go for 90 minutes. Where's the bonding/chatting/party atmosphere there?!",
        "It's not clear how the salon is set up - they should make very clear how nice all the pedicure stations are and that there's only ONE room for spa treatments (massage, facials, etc).  I see now it's primarily a nail salon.  Too late for us, as we'd planned various treatments but then didn't want to sit around (without the bride who was in another room).  If the booker had been more clear - we'd all have had mani/pedis at the same time as that's what it's set up for.  As it was, we came with our nails done and then had a latte while waiting.",
        "The bartender was very helpful and friendly and while we enjoyed the beetroot latte and cute decor, there's only so many of those you can drink while you wait for someone.  Most of the day was spent around our appointments at HMP but when we saw that it would involve sitting and waiting for the other person, we cancelled the rest of our plans and left.",

        "I went to your majesty’s pleasure on a Friday night for my moms birthday. We thought this place was going to be fun! I mean wine and pedis, what more could we ask for?!  But we were so disappointed. Once we waited 10 minutes to get to our actual service we sat down and the ladies asked if we had shellac on our toes, we did. Then they said that they won’t be able to do a full pedicure service because it’ll take an extra 15 minutes to remove the shellac from our toes. We decided to leave and when leaving we spoke to the manager and she said “sorry but it’ll take an extra 15 minutes so we can only change the nail colour”. I was disgusted by the way I was treated here. Never have I ever dealt with such terrible customer service especially when we were going to spend a lot of money there. When booking a service you should ask the client if they have shellac on and remind them of your policies, seeing as we had never been there before we never knew this was a thing and wasted our time going to a place where 15 minutes is too much to make a client happy. Every spa/salon I’ve been to this is included in a service. Never will I go there again and I will make sure all my friends, co workers and family know about this terrible experience so they don’t waste their time."

        "This was my second visit to Her Majesty's Pleasure and while the services were AMAZING both times, I have to say my last appointment left a bad taste in my mouth. I booked manicures and pedicures for myself, my sister and my mom for my sister's wedding, starting at 1pm. I had email confirmations with my appointment times, but as I work in the area, I dropped in the day before to confirm all my appointments (3 manicures and 2 pedicures). The girls at reception checked the computer and confirmed. I was set for 1pm.",
        "The day of the appointment, at 12:45, I receive an email reminder from Her Majesty's Pleasure that I have an appointment AT 12:45. I was already en route with my sister and my mother for our 1pm start time, so I ignored it, thinking it was an error. I live a few minutes away so I called a cab (my mother has a physical disability so we did need to wait for that cab). ",
        "At 12:55. I received a phone call from a gentleman at reception, asking if I was still coming. I informed him that yes, of course, I was just around the corner, but that my appointments started at 1pm so I was confused why I was being told I was 10 minutes late. ",
        "He argued with me, despite my telling him I had emails to prove my time slot, that I had confirmed in person the day before... He was very rude and very insistent that I was wrong about my start time, I was late, and that they would TRY to work us into the schedule, but that I WAS late and could miss out.",
        "After insisting that I had the times right, he finally acknowledged I did have ONE of the appointments starting at 1pm and if we could make there in a few minutes, they would honor my appointment.\" When I agreed, he thanked me coldly and hung up.",
        "By now, I feel sick that my sister's pre-wedding appointments are off to a bad start. This was not the customer service I expected from this company. The cab took a few minutes longer than expected/it does take my mother a bit longer to walk with her disability so we ended up being TWO minutes late. We rushed in and I apologized and spoke to other girls at the reception desk and they were very nice, told us not to worry, that we were fine for our appointments. The gentleman I spoke to was on the phone with another customer. I explained to the girls I had come yesterday to confirm my appointments and pulled out my email confirmations with the 1pm start time. They were very friendly and understanding and again told me not to worry. The gentleman, however, took time to pause in his phone conversation to tell me coldly that he'd MOVED my appointments and \"it was fine now.\" ",
        "I felt embarrassed by the treatment I had received from this employee, angry because I was about to spend a lot of money for services, and hurt because I had done EVERYTHING in my power to confirm my appointment times and to be there on time. Yet here I was being scolded, still holding my physical proof. Arriving at 1:02pm for a 1pm start time was not polite, I totally understand. But did I deserve this?",
        "The actual services and the ladies who worked on us were AMAZING. We were all VERY satisfied with that part. The bartender was very funny, friendly, and great service! The girls at reception were lovely and gracious! Our manicures were perfect and lasted for weeks after the wedding! The estheticians do phenomenal work!",
        "But the customer service from the gentleman at reception was an awful way to start my sister's wedding celebrations. ",
        "If you have complicated appointments with multiple people, make TRIPLE sure your times are right. I'm hoping that that particular employee is trained better on customer service. Arguing with customers on the phone rudely AND in person, shaming in front of other staff and other customers, is NOT good service."

We started off with a glass of prosecco each (included in our service) and then had our 2 bottles arrive while we had our nails done. Our nail technicians were wonderful and so kind. The bartenders were also awesome and took some cheesy photos for us and made sure we had everything we needed, including a delicious celebratory shot! I can't recommend this spot highly enough. For parties or just a special day out, this place really is the perfect blend of fun and quality. Will definitely be returning!"

First, I called two days ago before the appointment to ask about booking because I wanted us to both to get the same service. I left a voice mail and called back twice with no response. We showed up and Yuko I must did an amazing job with my friend, she loved her nails and the whole experience. Which is great because it's her day. But as for myself the one who paid and at that I prepaid for the service and with tips but nail technician Michele failed to clean my nails. I also felt she seemed lost some of the time. A original my appointment was booked with online with someone call Clara but somehow I end up with a completely different person. In the fact, I may just return back and go to Yuko."

        "I went back in December for a full mani/pedi with my boyfriend, who got the same (sans polish). When we arrived front desk was too busy giggling to greet us until they stopped and realized we had been standing in front of them. The nail technician didn't introduce herself, and did not do a good job at filing my bf's nails and keeping their shape. Honestly I have never seen anyone file nails like that - and I've accompanied many of my male friends on manicures. I was paying most attention to my own nails, so when I saw his, I asked for the technician (who, when she was done with him, just cleaned her station and walked away) to come back and see if she could file them to look more natural. She was clearly upset, did a bit of work, then when she was done, just walked off again. Meanwhile my mani/pedi was mediocre at best - my nail tech was very sweet and shy but was clearly a beginner. This experience cost us almost $200 (drinks not included)- and I spend a lot on beauty, but I spend for great service and better results. I got neither. ",
        "I gave HMP the benefit of the doubt and went back today. Same reception experience - no immediate hello, just an \"oh, you're there\" once the talking stopped, no pleasant smile. I only had about 35 mins, and I got a pedicure at my normal salon last week, so I just wanted a toenail colour change. My nail tech introduced herself (nice), went on to do my toenails (ok) and proceeded to clean her station and leave before even so much as looking at me (not so nice). Correct me if I'm wrong, but I thought it was general protocol to, as a nail tech, ask the patron whether or not they like their nails, or just look at them and say, \"ok?\" before scurrying away. Especially at a salon that markets itself as somewhat higher end. She had left by the time I realized that the polish on my left big toe was uneven, so I asked the nail tech beside me if there was any way they could call (insert name here) to look at my one nail. This nail tech said she was busy, I asked another one, same thing. Finally another nail tech caught my eye as I decided to just let it go it and leave or try once more to ask for my original nail tech. She fetches (name), who doesn't come out for a few minutes, and is clearly upset. She looks down and without even asking me what's wrong, she goes to the toe with the uneven polish. She fixes it, and then once again, just walks away before asking me if it looks okay to me. I picked up my bag (by myself), put on my shoes (by myself), paid (had to prompt to pay), and left (finally). ",
        "I truly think HMP could be great, and I don't know if this is a racial thing (which would disappoint me even more than just poor customer service). Either way, I will not be back any time soon..."

I found the answers on the online through a third party site. I booked my appointment online for 3 people. I canceled the third person's appointment online, mind you 3 days before the appointment, and called to confirm the cancellation and confirm the other two. Which one ofthe staff members confirmed this via phone. I get to my appointment and not one but two of the staff members asked me where the third person was? Then I get my services done, I went down to the parking garage, my hair was puffball. And to put the icing on the cake, my friend misplaced her ring. We called to ask if they saw it or someone returned it. The staff member never asked what it looked it like, where we were sitting, or if someone returned it we can call you back.

My friend’s manicurist was friendlier, but still once our manicures were over both manicurists left without giving us instructions on what to do even though we had never been there before. We had to ask someone if we were to sit there until dry or if we were expected to move out of the way. They told us to move without helping us to carry our things to a table in the bar, so we struggled to not ruin our nails while picking up our purses and my jacket. Once we were ready to pay, my friend had to go get her own jacket. Normally not a big deal, but I have been to your average nail shop where they offer much better and personal customer service. You would expect a place like this to take and return its customer’s jackets. Considering this place is supposed to be higher-end, it did not serve us to the quality that I thought they would for the cost of the service. Cute place but I would not return."

        "When we were greeted we were asked if we had any polish on our toes. My one friend and I did, we had gel polish. We were aware of the disclaimed on the website after booking the appointment that we would need to come without polish on or we would need to book a 15 minute service prior to our Gel Pedicure to have it removed. Naturally, we both forgot and came with it on. The lady at the front desk told us that we would no longer be able to get a gel pedicure as there wouldn't be enough time. They only now had time for the two of us to have the gel removal and a regular pedicure (no gel polish). I was confused as I regularly get gel pedicures at a different salon and never does it take more time than regular polish... On top of that it did not take 15 minutes to remove the gel polish. Anyways, I did not argue as I was here for my friends birthday and did not want to ruin the experience for her. We proceeded to have our pedicures done to find out that the two of us who had gel on our toes coming it, versus my friend who came in with no polish at all and was allowed to get her gel pedicure finished at the EXACT same time. Not to mention, there was nobody in line after me to have a pedicure therefore there would have been PLENTY of time for the two of us to have a gel pedicure. $60 to me for a regular polish pedicure is nonsense. ",
        "I have a wedding in a few days and my nails are already chipping (i got them done 3 days ago) this is why I booked for a gel pedicure. I will now have to get another pedicure prior to this wedding. The reason I am so particular on having gel polish is because I play sports and knew they wouldn't last with regular polish. ",
        "The lady at the front desk was extremely rude about this entire situation and had told us three different times that we should have come without polish on instead of trying to find a solution for us. By doing this, she also lost revenue for the business as it costs more for a gel pedicure and my friend and I were both willing to pay for the removal and the gel pedicure.",
        "She spoke down to us, was super condescending and I am more than certain this is not the way people want to be treated when coming out to a nice salon for a girls day.",
        "She also was very rude and snobby to the other employee's there in front of us which was extremely unprofessional.",
        "I believe the way this should have played out was for her to have said, start the removal and pedicure and I will come check on you when it is time for polish to see if there is time (which she would have seen there was more than plenty of). ",
        "Other feedback I can provide is that the Muskoka Chair's you sit in while getting a pedicure are cute however are EXTREMELY uncomfortable. While getting a pedicure you should be able to sit back and relax. This is not the case- it honestly feels like you are having a leg workout trying to hold your legs still so they don't slip back while they are painting your toes. (All 3 girls felt the same way) my legs actually hurt after leaving. ",
        "This Salon is all for looks. Very cute interior however, poor customer service, poor nail quality, and unsatisfied clients.",
        "I received an email after my treatment from the owners thanking me for my business and asking to write them an email with any positive or negative comments. I did write them my negative experience, however have not heard back.",
        "Needless to say, I will not be back and will pass on my experience to others. You should not be paying this type of money for the experience you will be having. Take your business elsewhere where you will be treated with respect and proper customer service."

        "My best friend and I went to the new Yorkville location for my birthday. We wanted blowouts. It was terrible. They wouldn’t accept a groupon purchased for their store, they were insincere and un-welcoming, awkward, and there is no flow to the space. I asked for a shot chocolate (which was on the menu) and was told “they didn’t have the mix”. My stylist asked if “I wanted the blowout to last until the end of the day”, which was ironic as my hair (which I asked to be loose and wavy) was flat by the time I got home. It was $50 plus tax and tip, and they (arguably illegally) slapped my friend’s wine and food tab on my own. That’s because they had to provide her with a free service a student her blowout was truly hideous. She had her hair in an elastic by the time she left the salon. The owner was indignant, I still haven’t received the promised credit, and I will never go back again."

My friends always want to go when they come visit me in Toronto (I live right by it) so I've probably gone through the struggling of booking treatments with them 3 times now. When I stay struggle it's because booking on their website never seems to work properly. I'll go through the trouble of booking a treatment, filling out all the fields (name, phone number etc.) only to get a message at the very end that says \"your treatment is no longer available\". ",

I opted to stay since I already made the trip to the salon. My service didn't even last 30 minutes - the girl was done in 23. She was SO rough and aggressive with cuticle cutting, digging into my skin and grabbing on to my toes so hard. The shape of my nails were also TERRIBLE - nothing was shaped the same; there were sharp corners and curved edges, some toes nails were even squiggly instead of straight at the top (I asked for rounded square). The paint job was also very subpar. Suffice to say, I could have done a better job myself. I was quite disappointed with the service as it fell way below my expectations. This was extremely overpriced for the quality of service and nails you get; I will not be coming back and do not recommend anyone who actually wants to come for a mani or pedi to come here either - you're better off at quite literally any other salon."

This caused little dirt particles to stick and be on my nails for the remainder of time i had this polish on. My nails were painted extremely uneven as well. I was honestly so disappointed and sad that i blew $65 on such a mediocre job. Will not ever be going back here to get any type of service done."

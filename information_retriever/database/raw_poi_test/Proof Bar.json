        "I stopped in for an early dinner having not eaten lunch; the interior space is comfortable with a mixture of furnishings.  There were just a few other patrons with one bartender and one wait person.  After checking out the menu, I decided to grab a spot on a sofa to order a drink and some food.  Having not see the wait person in a while I placed my order with the bartender.  I had to track down the wait person three times in total. My drink was good and the flatbread pizza was very  tasty.  Dessert was okay.  When all totaled together it was, in my view, expensive for the value and the service, based on my experience, was inattentive.  Overall, this is a comfortable hotel bar and I enjoyed what I ordered; based on my experience and in my opinion, there was a missed opportunity to provide service on par with the other elements of  experienced at this establishment."

        "I came here on Saturday to host my best friends bachelorette Party. I arrived with 9 people in hand and advised we will be expecting 2 more. One waiter brought over an extra seat that blocked the way of the waiters coming from the back of the house. We were seated in the section that seated only 8-9 people. 1 couch, 2 single seats and 3 ottomans. I asked one of the waiters there if we could be seated in the other booth which had more seats. He advised the booth was already reserved and that we could not move. ",
        "We said \"OK\" that was fine, especially if that group came with more people than we did. ",
        "The other group arrived, there were only 5 people in the group that were there. This was ridiculous! We were squishing 11 people to fit in one spot while others had a full couch or two person per couch that seated approx 4 people Maximum. But we had to squeeze 5 people on the couch in our area. This was minus one star. ",
        "Than the service was horrible. We were there from approx 9:15 to around 11:30 - 12.  When we first got there the waiter was barely around. We had to wait a long time to order our food and we did not all order at the same time. It was very staggered. Usually the waiter/waitress writes everything down and knows who had which item. This was not done. We were told if we were going to pay separate bills we had to write what we had on a piece of paper and provide it to the waiter/ waitress when it was time to pay. Isn't this the whole job as a waiter / waitress??? I might as well have got up to get my own food, if that was the case. Also, one of my guests asked for ketchup. So we thought it would be served in a little bowl/dish like it is served on the plate. NO! she brought over the whole bottle of ketchup which by the way did not look all that clean. At least if she put the ketchup in a bowl like it is supposed to be served it would have been a little bit more appreciated. Minus 1 star. ",
        "We had to wait forever for our food. Like 30 minutes each time ordering. The plate portions are super small, i do understand if the restaurant is \"small plate\" style. But if its a small plate and taking 30 minutes to come out of the kitchen than it has to taste incredible. NOPE! it did not. I would give the food a 3.8 out of 5, if i were to rate it. Minus 1 star.",
        "Also, when asked about a mistake on the bills the waiter gave us an attitude. I do not know if she was having a bad day or what? But it was uncalled for. Minus 1 star. ",
        "And to top it off, the restaurant was not busy what so ever. There were people coming in and out but no one stayed as long as we did. We had 11 people in our party and each person did order quite a few of items. Also, gratuity was added to our bills. Personally I do not feel it was deserved by the wait staff that served us. There was one waiter with dreads that actually helped us out a little bit who was really nice. But he wasn't our assigned waiter. I think our tip should have been given to him. Minus 1 star. ",
        "On the bright side, the place is absolutely beautiful!!! I will give them a thumbs up for that. ABSOLUTELY AMAZING, the chairs were comfy, and the space was very calming. The music was pretty good, but the songs were rotated quite frequently. For a 3 hour time, we heard the same songs maybe 3 times. So rotation may have been every hour. Wish it was a little more variety though :) but that is ok. Plus 1 star.",
        "Also, at the end of our night they provided us with complimentary truffles and brownie which was really nice. I commend them for that. That is Plus  1 star."

At first I was worried because it is such a nice place and I was bringing in a four year old.  Our server Ravi quickly put me at ease.  He brought my daughter some colouring pages and crayons, and put her lunch order in first so that her food would come quickly.  I ordered the Club Sandwich with salad, and of course stole some of my daughters fries. lol.  They were delicious!  My sandwich was huge and packed with so much good stuff, avocado tomatoes etc. on fresh grainy bread.  Tasted amazing, and good for you too!  Ravi , our server, is a true professional.  I've worked in the food industry before and I know when someone takes pride in delivering an excellent experience to their guests.  It doesn't get better than this.

        "There used to be a bar at the corner of Hazelton and Ave with street appeal windows. You could peer in, even if you didn't enter. It looked inviting. The hotel that housed it was a mainstay of the Yorkville scene. The corner was gutted for condos and the hotel rebuilt a few corners over. Its rebuild/redesign came with \"wind tunnel,\" a waterless fountain and a \"garden\" that isn't user-friendly. Then there are the grills/grates to navigate on entry, perhaps for \"contemporary cookie-cutter feel,\" but you feel like you are entering a cage or maze there. Contrast the entry to the hotel in which Proof Vodka Bar is housed. Nothing much there, and nothing pretentious. You can walk right in and through to the bar and not feel awkward or that you have to make any particular impression. A couple of days ago (Monday evening), two groups happily coexisted in the same space, Pierre's wonderful French Meet Up (2nd Monday of every month) and a \"25 dates\" event (age 55 cut-off). The two groups seemed to cross pollinate: \"grass always greener,\" and dispelling the \"principal\" that over 55s aren't \"25 dates\"-worthy. It was quite entertaining. The bar attendants took the chance coming together of two different worlds in stride. Lighting is warm and there are cozy around the corner seats for those who want a bit of privacy for quiet chats. Any large group seems comfortable, as this is an easy spot for mingling and meeting.Those who visit alone manage to find place and space too. There was a horrible storm going on outside, but the cheerful artwork dotted on walls around lifted mood. Not sure why \"Vodka\" is in name. That does and did not seem to be the draw."

        "Luxury bar attached to the Intercontinental Yorkville, a luxury hotel. Their specialty is exotic cocktails. The cocktails are $20 each on average. It is in Yorkville, playground of the rich and famous. So you need to dress up. Think James Bond. Suit and tie kind of place.",
        "Serves a high-class clientele, the money crowd. Very posh, stylish and swank. Their cocktails are exotic and not ones you will find at other more traditional bars. And the ambience is dark and sultry. It is Euro chic and the food is Spanish tapas- expensive and exotic. 5 stars for originality and quality.",

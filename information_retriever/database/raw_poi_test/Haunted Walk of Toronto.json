I might have been disappointed with the lack of activity if it was more expensive, but it was very good value for the cost. The atmosphere was super creepy and the stories were great.",
        "The only place that felt active for me was the Burwick House. Half of our group could hear creaking and movement coming from upstairs, and some of us (myself included) also heard crying. I don't think I was imagining it, because I didn't experience anything anywhere else. Upstairs was eerie and uncomfortable, especially the room with the cradle. I felt a heaviness on my back and chest that only lifted when we left the house. I was with my fianc√© and he didn't experience any of this, so I guess it's very individual."

        "My boyfriend and I came here for the 6:15 PM Ghost tour! ",
        "Our tour guide, Mia, was incredible and very nice. ",
        "She would always state facts in response to the comments that some of the guests made. For instance, in the Burwick house, as you reach the top floor, it gets very hot. Some guests were curious about this, and Mia explained that pioneers built their homes in a way to insulate heat. I appreciated Mia ‚Äúdebunking‚Äù certain feelings/situations as to show that not everything experienced should be passed off as paranormal. ",
        "However, when we were in the Manse house, Mia‚Äôs lantern began to randomly flicker, dimming and then shining bright. She said that it must be dying batteries, but her lantern was fine everywhere else outside the Manse house. I kept thinking about that throughout the tour. ",
        "Because I have never myself experienced any sort of ghostly activity, I tried to keep an open-mind and anticipated that if I were to witness anything, that I would attempt to debunk it. While touring the church, Mia explained that people have witnessed orbs floating in the cemetery. I was not nervous, or panicking when she said this as I know that can affect how people begin to perceive/see things thereafter. I just absorbed her information and we moved along.",
        "When we toured the cemetery from the front gate, I was shining my flashlight that was given to us for the tour, towards the tombstones, and I had randomly seen a random ball of whitish/blue light float down from a tree near the front of the cemetery all the way down to the front gate. Now, I tried to keep mouth shut about it because I didn‚Äôt want people to think that I was reacting just to ‚Äúreact.‚Äù But, I could not stay quiet, because the natural human response to seeing something unexplainable is to say ‚ÄúWhat the f-!‚Äù Lol. ",
        "I promise you guys that this was not dust, a bug, a leaf, or car lights. I also thought about it possibly being someone else‚Äôs flashlight, but I debunked this. A flashlight being shone out does not form a perfectly round circle mid-air, unless it has something to reflect off of in the background. In which this case, the cemetery was open field. Everyone‚Äôs flashlights just casted a wave of light, not small round circles.  ",
        "This orb was perfectly spherical and moving on its own accord, despite the wind (the wind would affect the direction that a bug or leaf would move, and the car lights would have had nothing to reflect off of, this was floating in mid air) as it had randomly appeared from the tree and had floated down to the front gate and disappeared. When I had seen it, I froze and said ‚ÄúOh my God! I just seen something float down!‚Äù Mia turned to me and asked what was it, and I explained as above. She assured me that she believed me and encouraged me to continue to keep an open mind. ",
        "I continued shining my light, but it did not reappear and I can affirm that I had definitely seen a spirit orb. I did not feel afraid or nervous, it just felt surreal and I took that experience home with me. ",

Last night was atmospheric for a walk around the old buildings at Black Creek Pioneer Village, with a bright beautiful moon and chill in the air. I haven‚Äôt experienced anything on any of the prior walks, but odd things started in the very first building we entered when a chain that blocks off entrance to a bedroom started swinging back and forth on its own while the guide was talking. Nobody was near it at the time. Then in the ‚ÄúMinister‚Äôs house‚Äù I was the last person to enter and had to close the door. I paused to look around while doing so. There were only 4 of us in the group plus our guide and everyone had already moved on into the house to the right when I heard a loud bang in the room to my left, which is blocked off. It sounded like someone banging their fist on a desk or table and I thought someone had gone around to prank me. However, no one had, and there wasn‚Äôt another way into the room. I tried to re-create the sound, looked for a fallen item etc but couldn‚Äôt figure out what made the noise. The third odd thing is a photo I took in front of a house. All the photos I took turned out fine, except for one that came out a bit blurry despite taking in in the same way as the others. This photo shows a blue streak of light and what looks like a horse galloping out of the front door. All in all, an entertaining evening!"

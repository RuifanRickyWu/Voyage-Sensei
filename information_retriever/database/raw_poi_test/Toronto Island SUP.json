        "I have long wanted to try SUP, but there isn't anywhere to do it near where I live, so when we started planning a day trip to Toronto, I googled and found Toronto Island SUP. I booked a lesson via their website, received confirmation and reminder emails and was able to print the waiver, good communication and ease of use overall. Our lesson was in the lagoon on Wards Island, to which you'll have to take the ferry or water taxi from Toronto. We took the ferry, and bought tickets prior to arriving which was good because the line at the Jack Layton ferry terminal was insane! Be sure to give yourself plenty of time to get there. We arrived early so we grabbed a bite to eat at the Rectory Cafe, which was right across the path from the Algonquin Bridge where we were to meet for the lesson. The \"location\" was a utility vehicle with trailer that was used to bring all the gear to the bridge meeting site. Once it was time for the lesson we turned in our waivers, put on a life vest, grabbed a paddle and circled up for some basic introductory info, then into the water we went. Julian was a good instructor, I felt comfortable from start to finish. We started out on our knees until we were comfortable, then stood when we were ready. We toured the lagoon, then went out toward the lake and that iconic Toronto skyline, which was a great spot for a photo. We were out for about an hour, it was a blast! This is definitely and experience that I'll remember for a long time!"

Obviously you have belongings because you plan on spending the day on the island. Its a leave by the tent at your own risk or use one of their dry bags at your own risk. ",
        "We showed up at 255pm for our 330pm lesson so yes we were early but they ignored us and wouldnt take our waivers or suit us up until the instructor got there, fine. Instructor showed up at 315 still not taking waivers or suiting us up until the rest of the class got there. The four other people that were part of our group didnt show up until 4pm. Even though there are clear instructions on the web that if you are not on time you forfeit your lesson with no refund they still made us wait. The staff helped these people first while we still stood waiting. ",
        "Once we finally got ready to go out our instructor was so soft spoken we could barely hear her over the hustle and bustle of the beach and boats on the water. SUP was a lot of fun but i would NOT do it here again. Better off doing it in cottage country where they appreciate people more."

The location was calm and quiet, and made learning alot easier than having alot of city noise and onlookers. Honestly was a great experience, and worth trying at least once.

        "My wife had been thinking of trying paddle boarding for the past 2 years.  Months ago she told me not to buy her a paddle board in the event she tried it and didn't like it.  I decided to surprise her with SUP lessons as part of her birthday gift.   I checked Tripadvisor and other company's websites and liked that Toronto Island SUP has you \"travel\" to the lovely Toronto Islands and if you so desired, can make a day of it on the islands.  Also I liked that their introduction lesson was described on their informative website as 75 minutes long which included free time on the board at the end of your lesson.  Most if not all other companies offered 60 minute lessons.",
        "I checked their website thoroughly and found all the information there to plan my time with them.  I bought my ferry tickets online for the first time and I highly recommend that, especially during the warmer busier months.  I wasn't sure if online tickets would get me through the gate earlier so we still left our home extra early just in case.  Although there was a HUGE line at the ferry docks on the land side, we were able to walk right through and not line up as we had online tickets. As a result, we ended up being one and a half hours early.  No issue because it's so nice to walk around Toronto Islands.",
        "We arrived at the south beach of Ward's island 15 minutes before our scheduled time as recommended.  By the way, instructions including directions are on their website and on the tickets once you place your order.  Julian was our instructor and our class was full which is capped at 6 people.  Nice small size for great instruction and supervision by the instructor.  Although I could not feel any wind, the waters were a bit choppy.  More so than 1.5 hours earlier when were first saw the waters on our arrival.  I am 50 years old and in average shape with not great cardio.  And my swimming capabilities are below average.  Julian instructed us on how to properly adjust the length of your paddle and other basic instructions while on the beach.  Then we headed out onto the water where he constantly provided instructions and supervision while giving us time to practice his new instruction.  Even though there was a lot of swimmers in the water, we paddled out around the swimmers to where the boats were anchored in the lake.  The water was clear once you got away from the shore area.  So clear that you could see the bottom of the lake in the areas you paddle(not too deep).  I found the most trouble balancing on the board (wobbled a lot compared to everyone else in the group) and fell in the water 3 times.  The last two times was when I momentarily looked elsewhere.  By the way, the humidex was 40 degrees Celsius at this time and the water was very warm.  I couldn't believe how great the water felt.  At the end of the instructions, Julian gave us 15 minutes on the water to do what we pleased.  In addition to the instructor, Toronto Police lifeguards are on rowboats in the water also keeping an eye on you.  Do not bring valuables with you if you don't need them as they are not responsible for lost or stolen items.  No one had anything lost or stolen but I am just mentioning this as no one should bring anything that is not necessary whenever you will not have them with you irregardless of the activity.  The most important thing, my wife and I had a fantastic time and talked about it all the way home.  We will be returning as our children heard what fun we had and they want to do it now.  Thanks Julian!"

        "We attended a session to do an ECO paddle with a focus on bird watching during the migration season; it was interesting.  Lots of birds, information, etc.  We stayed within the channels of the island not the open lake.",
        "SUP is a great way to reset and refresh.  Anyone looking to escape the city, local or tourist, should consider a day on the island.    If you're experienced at SUP, rent a board, grab a map, take a couple hours and enjoy at your leisure.  If not, head out with the group.  You'll be in good hands.",
        "BTW, I also had to cancel and reschedule.  It was easy and worked just as stated on the website.  No issues, easy peasy.  ",
        "Enjoy the paddle!"

        "It was easy and convenient to book a rental on-line. They do a quick test to see if you can paddle in kneeling and standing. Then you are free to explore the lagoons and islands in the area. It is a fun way to bird watch and explore the smaller islands that are more easily accessible. A nice island activity."

        "Okay, without sounding like I have a total alcohol problem, the beer vendors have changed the size of their cups so that when you buy a beer, they pour from a can but don't use the whole can. They then use left over from your purchase for the next customer. All while charging the same as they did last year, when they gave you the whole can.",
        "We found one vendor that was either sick enough of hearing the complaints, or shamed enough by the end of the game, that poured the remainder of the can into another cup. By that measure, which was third of a cup, for every three cans of beer that you buy for the same price as last year, they are gyping you one beer.",
        "If you buy a beer from a vendor in the stands, it is the same price as the beer garden and the vendor gives you the whole can.",
        "This is NOT COOL and should be changed."

        "Attended my first Toronto Arrows professional “Rugby Union” game last Sunday.  Also my first time at Lamport Stadium.  I am hooked!!  Returning this week for the final pre-playoff game.  This is  class rugby.  I am not a fan of  the Rugby “ League” style game.  I prefer the real deal.   Lots of bars in the area for post game activities.  Parking was easy, and right at the stadium.  Cost us $14.      Does anyone know if you can bring food in to the Stadium?  They made me dump my water out before entering."

Rugby is a fast sport which is always on the move and totally unpredictable - getting to the try line is not enough you have to get that ball on the ground and that is never a given. Lamport Stadium is a cute little place where every seat is great and the fans will help you understand what is going on. The Wolfpack make sure you are never bored and the sideline tents have a great selection of craft beers and ciders. Super for all - family, couples, groups! Am certainly a fan!"

        "Prior to our visit to Toronto, as rugby league fans in the UK we wondered if we should make a visit to Lamport Stadium to see where the Woolfpack play. We were delighted that PRO Oliver responded, not once but several times, to ensure we were aware of the dates and times the team were training. Not only did we go, but Oliver spied us from the sidelines and came to introduce himself. We watched the session, smiled and waved at the players and were pretty much in awe of their capabilities. The stadium is as we would expect in the UK, weather was great and the whole atmosphere very friendly. If you like rugby league and are in the area, go to have a quick look around and you'll understand better what the RL authorities are trying to achieve. Thanks to all, we enjoyed ourselves."

Also the best beer garden in town, which opens an hour before the game and stays open for 2 hours after, consisting of local craft brewers, plus Jack Daniels, wine, and rum stations.   Don't get me wrong, there is a family atmosphere - the players circle the stadium post-match and interact with the fans."

        "I've had the chance to visit Lamport Stadium a number of times the last two years thanks to the existance of Toronto's newest sports team, The Toronto Wolfpack! A professional Rugby League team playing in a European (mostly UK) league, they have brought a great atmosphere for friends and families to enjoy on Saturday afternoons. From great music, cheerleaders to a Craft Beer Garden that's open from 3-9pm on game days, good concessions, and affordable ticket prices, The Den is the place to be! The facilities are pretty no-frills but they've got water fountains to fill water bottles, extra toilets by way of porta-potties, and they've just upgraded the turf to 4G! As an added bonus, a number of players stick around after the game to chat with fans and have a drink in the beer garden. So much more accessible than other other team in the city!"

For $23 per ticket, the entertainment value far exceeds any of the \"major league\" teams in this city. The atmosphere was just plain fun. The team is just plain fun to watch. It's so refreshing for a long suffering Toronto sports fan to see a team that is faster, stronger and just better than their opponent. (They won 64-12 over Dewsbury - poor guys flew all this way to get whooped). A few of the hits were actually exhilarating. Can't recall the last time a Toronto athlete hit anyone - Bobby Baun in 1964? These guys are big and rough and mean and nasty. Really fun to watch. I'm nervous about them moving up to Superleague next year but hopefully they can compete. The stadium is small and intimate with lots of bars and restaurants nearby. From outside it looks a bit pathetic but once you're inside it's quite nice. The real grass pitch looks lovely. The fans were fun loving and not too serious. So refreshing, especially compared to the Jays and LEAFS."

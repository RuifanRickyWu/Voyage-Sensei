Factor in the Canadian culture, weather, and economy, STC would feel the closest to a grand mall in the Philippines. High ceilings, sprawling paths and although only two floors high, the floor area is sizeable and parking is abundant. On a good weekend, this place can get pretty packed. Access is easy via private car or public transportation. Shop till you drop, eat till you're full, come here and leave satisfied."

        "I was at Scarborough Town Centre (STC) onNov. 11/18.  The parking was jammed at STC because of construction.  As a result, there is much less parking available.  There is so many cars looking for parking and with all the pedestrians crossing, it was not only congested but also quite dangerous.  There was no one to direct traffic, to help pedestrians cross safely nor to help drivers to find parking.  When I returned from my shopping after 30 minutes, I found a ticket on my windshield for $30.  I called STC on Nov. 12/18 and even though I asked to speak to management I was directed to Security. The security manager (K**e) tells me that the ticket was issued because of a complaint (I asked to see the documented complaint) of parking on hash marks.  He claims that they watch everything from cameras.  I submitted to him that rather than watching the cameras, send people out to help people find their way safely (both pedestrians and drivers).  It seems there are enough resources to go out and slap on tickets just not to do the services that people actually need.  I wrote and asked the property management I be reimbursed for this ticket.  After over a week I had still not heard a response and wrote back to ask again to respond.  As of the writing of review, I had not heard back.",
        "I will not be shopping there going forward.  There is plenty of competition that I would recommend to those who want to shop in the area like Pickering Town Centre.  As well, take a busy mall like Yorkdale where there is support for parking with mall personnel going around to help.  As well, they tell you how many spots are available in each area and in the decked parking, there is actual lights above the parking spots that indicate if it is available or not.  What a fantastic idea. ",

Parked at the mall had a nice chat while in line at Timmie's. We saw RISE in the loading dock at City Hall and wow there was a singer there named Brooke and she was fantastic. The movies on the side of the rotunda and the comments projected on the front of Scarborough Town Hall really connected. The display of the globe balloons were still in the mall yesterday. One of the performance artists was downton last year and her aboriginal stories are captivating. My favourite display was in Frank Faubert's woods the trail of lit up hand sculptures was ethereal. Bravo to all the artists and performers who really did such a great job and I hope that next year there will be even more participants."

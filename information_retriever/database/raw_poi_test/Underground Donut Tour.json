        "Underground Donut Tour always does an amazing job of putting together these tours and their staff is fantastic. The Toronto tour may be a bit new, but lived up to the high standards. Great fun and delicious donut spots that I wouldn't have normally checked out. The tour was a lot of fun and the donuts are so good. COPS was my favorite probably because of the DunkAroos glazed mini donuts (one of the weekly rotational glaze flavors) which checked all the nostalgic flavor boxes for me, but all donut stops on the tour were amazing. I also love that the people that give these tours are the best for any other recommendations for travelers. Aton (hopefully I'm spelling that right) had a flavor palette that one could describe as like that of your best cooking / baking nanna. Lots of floral flavor recommendations and they really worked for me. And if floral flavors aren't your thing, he could definitely recommend something that hits the spot for everyone. His recommendations for other restaurants were perfect. The really guy knew his food (especially donuts). If you are going to be in Toronto for a few days at least, I would suggest go on this tour early into your trip. You'll get the best recommendations for the rest of your travelling days. Overall, great tour, exceptionally tasty donuts, and just a fun time walking around the city. Come hungry and you'll leave very satisfied."

From the moment we arrived, the staff was welcoming, professional, and organized, ensuring everything ran smoothly.",

        "We also had an awesome time with dodgeball—it was fast-paced, fun, and full of laughs, giving us a great opportunity to bond with our colleagues in a friendly, competitive atmosphere.",
        "The venue was spacious, clean, and well-maintained, and the staff made sure we were all comfortable with the rules and, most importantly, focused on safety. We left feeling energized, motivated, and much closer as a team.",

You play several different game styles that require teamwork and strategy to be successful. We were with a great group of players, so the mission were well-played. The coaches made sure we were playing responsibly to avoid injury. They take photos for free, so you can get some great action pics off of their Facebook page the next day. I think it was absolutely worth the cost and the travel time to go."

You also put on a hockey helmet so that your head it protected.  I did get hit in the head twice and it was ok.",

        "HIghly recommended for families. We took our 5-year old grandson and we all enjoyed it.  The actors brought humour, action, and a wonderful way of managing kids on holiday. People may think the experience needs more activities for the kids but there's very little space on the dock or on the boat, so we felt the actors did the best they could with the space and time available. The staff also called us - phoned us! - 2 days later to follow-up and ask us for feedback. We were so impressed.  Well done to all the staff involved!"

I know that should go without saying, but after taking an Uber downtown or walking the harbour front to reach the pirate ship, your only bathroom options are the Loblaws a few blocks away, some questionable porta potties nearby, or the airport bathrooms that we never did figure out how to get to. Just plan for it is all. Don’t get caught unaware. 😉"

We attended on a somewhat rainy day and loved having very few people on our tour so my shy son felt comfortable stepping forward to participate fully with the engaging actor/pirates. From learning how to scare away jellyfish with silliness, to developing sword battle skills, to the highlight of attacking an attacking pirate with water cannons, my kid was totally engaged throughout. Two thumbs up."

They did some coloring, they answered questions about where treasure might be hidden, they had some songs and dances, and the best part was defending the ship with water canons against an enemy pirate ship that came up along side the ship. The kids ran back and forth from canon to canon to try and hit the other ship and they succeeded in drenching the bad guy pirate! Great fun for the family."

  "description": "Golf at the Angus Glen Golf Club offers beauty, challenge, first-class service and maybe best of all, variety. Angus Glen Golf Club is a public golf course and is known internationally for hosting PGA Tour events on both of its championship golf courses. Each time you choose to play Angus Glen, you are walking the same fairways that the world’s best golfers have competed on. The South Course hosted the 2002 Canadian Open, when John Rollins defeated Justin Leonard and Neal Lancaster in an exciting sudden death playoff. Capturing the title for the second consecutive year Jim Furyk out duelled Vijay Singh on the North Course to win the 2007 Canadian Open.",

We didn't see the course Marshall the entire round, so there was no one to speed up play. It was well over 5 hours by the time we were finished. ",

        "This course had been the site for PGA, Skin game and many tournaments. It is not an easy course with high rough and deep bunkers which is almost a one stroke penalty when you drove into them. The club house is very good and the service is admirable. The driving range is also well kept and the staff pays good attention to serve all the players. It is free so one can warm up well before tee off. Green fee is not cheap and above $150 but for this price, think it is a bit overpriced. One may be able to get a lower rate via \"Golfnow\" website or sometimes there may be coupons (from Underpar.com or southernontariogolfer.com) available at a substantial discount off the regular price. But if you are a visitor, you better check before coming in town and plan your schedule ahead to enjoy the discount."

She was so positive and fun and handled all of our questions quickly and thoroughly.  I got the sense that she really cared about us and our day and I trusted her opinions and suggestions.  She provided a structure to keep us organized and made sure everything was ready well ahead of time.  On the night of the rehearsal, she organized everyone and carried out everything I wanted, leaving me to enjoy the night stress-free.  The day of the wedding went so smoothly.  When I arrived everything was perfect and I could truly enjoy the experience.  I’m sure she worked so hard behind the scenes to make it all run smoothly.  THANK YOU Christy!!!",

One of my favourite parts was escaping with my husband and photographers on a golf cart to take pictures around the grounds.  Angus Glen staff accompanied us with hors d’oeuvres and beer!  It was a fun and relaxing time between my new husband and I that I am so thankful for.  ",

The meal was excellent and so many of our guests commented to us on how it was the best wedding food they’ve ever had.  We had a choice of steak, salmon, and chicken.  They were all delicious but we got the most comments on how the steak was “restaurant quality.”  ",

The clubhouse is beginning to look tired, the service was decent but far from outstanding and the course in rougher shape than it should have been.  I found the greens slow, many grass areas thinned out and the bunkers in rough shape.  Angus Glen seems to be living off of the fact they twice hosted the Canadian Open together with the Pan Am Games.  Frankly, there aren't many memorable holes and for the price point you'll find way better public courses in the Greater Toronto Area."

Course is in great shape, still a challenge for the average golfer, with the greens being very fast.   I love this course, we had a great day, fine meal afterwards on the patio...just a great golfing experience overall."

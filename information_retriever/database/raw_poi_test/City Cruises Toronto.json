Although the Tripadvisor ad noted that audio guides were available in several languages, including French, the staff told us they have not offered this for several years.  Apparently they have asked Tripadvisor to update their ad but this has not happened.  We were very disappointed since our friends from West Africa speak French.  We did our best to translate but the guide spoke very quickly and so this was challenging."

First of all, as advertised, itâ€™s not a 60-minute trip; itâ€™s a 40-minute cruise. You could have a better experience on a water taxi for $12 or on much smaller cruises.",
        "The cruise trip started at 8:04 PM (four minutes late) and lasted for 40 minutes, essentially circling the same area without going very far and not even close to the Toronto Island. After 40 minutes, the cruise started backing up to the dock and stopped exactly at 8:48 PM. The final 12 minutes were spent disembarking. By 8:58 PM, the cruise was empty, and the entire experience was less than an hour. It's not worth the money. There are better and cheaper options available around the harborbay on smaller cruises that take you much farther towards and around the back of Toronto Island."

YOU WILL BE CHARGED REGARDLESS OF THE WEATHER! It was pouring rain, and we obviously did not want to go on a boat cruise anymore because we were travelling with a small two year old baby as it was unsafe but they still refuse to give you a refund! EXTREMELY UNREASONABLE AND UNRELIABLE! How can I predict the weather 24 hours before a trip? You will only be given a refund if the operator decides to cancel, but if you request a refund yourself, you will be charged the full amount. So obviously the operator will not cancel because they still want to make money! They put their customers at risk and do not care about their safety! DISGUSTING"

The boat and fishing tackle were all in exceptional condition and Aaron was focused on making sure that we had a memorable experience. We caught coho, chinook, and Atlantic salmon, along with a lake trout. Aside from the fishing which was super-fun, we really enjoyed talking with Aaron. I'm not exaggerating when I say that it felt like we were out on the lake with a friend. And, Aaron's general knowledge of Toronto was much appreciated for us out-of-towners. We would highly recommend booking a trip with Epic Sportfishing if are looking to get out on Lake Ontario!"

        "My wife, son and I had an amazing time with Aaron! We are total novices at fishing yet managed to reel in three huge salmon and a rainbow trout. The wind looked like it may be rough out there and Aaron kept an eye on it stayed in touch with us all the way through. We made the decision to head out only hours before the charter was scheduled but it just goes to show you how Aaron really wanted us to be comfortable out there and made sure we knew the conditions. We were fortunate and even though it called for 9 miles per hour wind, it was pretty smooth. Now onto the fishing, there are no guarantees with anything in life especially fishing but Aaron isn't just some move-'em in and move 'em out fishing charter. He has the experience, boat and equipment to definitely increase your probability of getting action. Think Yoda and Jedi Knight. Aaron was talking to us one second and as if he had some form of sixth sense, suddenly spun around and grabbed a pole that was bending, made sure a fish was hooked on it and then handed then to my son and coached him on how to reel it in. Aaron could tell from about 25 feet out that it was a rainbow trout. I couldn't even see it in the wake of the boat! And this is how our night went with small periods of conversation and downtime and bursts of action. This fishing charter was the best part of our week long trip to NIagara and Toronto. Many thanks to Aaron for a great time and memories worth a lifetime!"

Aaron worked very hard to make sure the boys had opportunities to catch some fish. We hooked a lot more than we got in the boat!

We went out on July 30, 2020,  2 good friends and  3 kids, ages 12-17.  Our main goal was 1)  for our boys to have the experience of catching big fish  2)  for the  2 adults (who are really just big kids at heart) to catch big fish.  Aaron is a low talker (for us Seinfeld fans) who reminds me of the world's most interesting fisherman (for us Dos Equis fans).  He works extremely hard to ensure all we did was reel in the fish.  At the end, Aaron even stayed out later for us because he really wanted one of us to catch one last big fish.  And amazingly, it happened.....take a look at this pic.  I recommend this day trip for anyone who wants to catch big fish, experience the wonders of nature, and meet a passionate professional fisherman who's greatest joy is the success of his charge and witnessing the enthrallment in our faces."

He had called me ahead of time to let me know about conditions on the lake and so we decided to start a bit later to avoid the potential for seasickness. That was helpful. We were not expecting too much but were hoping for a few strikes and hoped to land one or two fish. Well Aaron definitely knew how to coax the fish out of hiding as we landed six salmon in the space of 4 hours including three 20+ pound Chinook salmon. At one stage right before we went in we landed three salmon simultaneously. It was truly an awesome experience. I was hoping my son would get the chance to experience real salmon fishing and we got way more than that. I won't forget it.  Overall, it was a great day out. Aaron is extremely knowledgeable and personable. Highly recommended."

        "Aaron was not only a great skipper and guide but also a strong promoter of Ontario Sporsfishing industry.  We learn a lot about sustainable fishing in Lake Ontario and appreciate his passion and enthusiasm about fishing. What an experience to fish salmon and trouts just outside of Toronto.  Highly recommend to give it a try and to come back for more for a chance to catch the 40 pounders."

        "Erin was a great Captain, he was extremely hard-working and knowledgeable. It was thanks to him that everyone caught a fish, including myself which I wasn't sure would be possible. We shared so many laughs and even ate birthday cake for breakfast, haha!",
        "Thank you so much, Erin for such an amazing time, our team made some wonderful memories that day.",

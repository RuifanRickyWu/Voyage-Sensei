Be advised that these tours include not only samples, but also full servings.

Caitlin, the operations manager  for Culinary Adventures Company was there as well to lend support for Morgan who was in training ( not that you could tell)! Caitlin also contributed some amazing stories and tips. Who knew that you are supposed to place cheese on your tongue and let it warm up to truly appreciate all the flavours?

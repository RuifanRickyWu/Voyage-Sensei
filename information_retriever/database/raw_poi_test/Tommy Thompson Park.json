They have destroyed so many trees and it seems that their population is growing every year. We can't go to the few beaches anymore as they have invaded so much of it. The smell of droppings isn't so pleasant either and is quite toxic and in a time of pandemic this is hardly the time to have birds that spread their germs for everybody to inhale. ",
        "I hope something will be done soon otherwise they may also invade the Toronto Islands.   I heard that oil on the eggs is a compassionate way to reduce their population.  They do nest high in the trees so the use of drones certainly can only help,"

It's been a slow motion creation out of landfill, almost by accident, but it has wildlife, views which remind me of Van Gogh paintings, sailboats, a lighthouse and a million dollar view of bustling Toronto. The only problem is the popularity on weekends. When I first came here it was for the solitude so close to the city but now it's being discovered and as one of the few great free spaces in Toronto and is becoming overcrowded on weekends. But if you come here in the off hours, you can spot feral ferrets, coyotes (one stalked me once), cormorants, beavers and a lot more. The swallows are my favourite at sunset."

        "Tommy Thompson Park is a man-made spit of land projecting into Lake Ontario just east of downtown Toronto. Despite being made of landfill and construction debris, it has become a remarkably \"natural\" refuge for birds and animals, and even humans wanting a break from urban life. Migratory birds stop over during spring and fall -- some stay for the entire summer -- and there are large permanent populations of cormorants, herons, geese, ducks, hawks, gulls and songbirds. Beavers often can be seen, also weasels and snakes (harmless). The view of the city from the end of the spit is spectacular, and on a clear days one can see all the way to Hamilton and the north shore of the Niagara Peninsula. It's closed during weekdays because landfill is still dumped there, but open evenings and weekends and holidays. Can be bleak and beautiful in winter. Because of its size, it rarely feels crowded even when thronged with birders, sightseers, joggers and cyclists. More of a resource for Torontonians than tourists, but always a nice escape for anyone wanting to get away from urban grit."

        "Not too far from the Toronto downtown core and one can drive there with no difficulty at all. Indeed I usually stay in Markham in the North when I visited Toronto and I had managed to take public transport (45 minutes) to the Park although a bit of walking to the park entrance would be required. There is a small parking lot at the Park entrance but somehow the long stretch of road leading to the Park as well as a cross road at its front provides plenty of road side parking too. The Park opens weekday evenings from 4-9pm and then weekends and holidays from 5:30am to 9pm (This is the newest information on their website, but in my past visits, sometimes they are closed during weekdays for construction projects so one better check before going).

        "Basically this is a great place for biking and jogging, as well as family outing.  it affords a great view of downtown including the CN tower in a distance across Lake Ontario.  For me, its importance lies in the birding opportunities it offers. It is known that the month of May and September are the best months to see the most variety of birds passing through Toronto and this Park is one of the favorite spots, May being the peak time for birds coming from the south to breed in the north and September when they return via Toronto to the warm south. Each time they stay for 2-3 weeks to feed themselves well before their long journeys. I have been here a couple of  times over the past year but somehow either the weather was not optimal or the timing was not right (this particular visit is in August which is before the birds' September return trip), I did not manage to see too many species. But of course there are resident birds in the Park as well and that alone is good enough reason for me to visit whenever I am in Toronto if the weather permits. A gentle reminder, you need to bring along drinking water and some snacks (food) for your journey as there is no shop whatsoever inside the park. The only thing that is available is a hot dog stand that sells bottled drinks as well right outside the entrance. And then rain gear is also necessary just in case weather abruptly changes as there are no rain shelters either."

        "I have been to over 50 breweries in the U.S. and Canada and this is definitely one of my fav's. For starters, their beer is outstanding. They have a great variety and something for everyone. They come out with new brews and team up with other breweries so there's always something new to try. The brewery gives tours and even has an area to watch the big games. Playoff baseball is a must here! If you love baseball like I do, then the baseball themed brewery, beers and cool merchandise make it even better. The staff are always polite and helpful and it's always a chill place to hang out. I even met the owners and they are great people who take pride in what they do and work hard to deliver some of the best craft beers around. I strongly recommend stopping by the brewery for a tasting, tour or to watch a game. And don't forget to look around for the brewery's mascot, a basset hound named, Wrigley. He's very friendly and even has his own award winning beer! "

Sure it's the name of a ball park, but also it's the name of the brewery's dog!",

Had the grapefruit Saison (Sunlight Park) and was quite nice. They didn’t have the pomegranate one I had at Relish. Eight or so on tap and grab and goes available from the bar / shop.  Think the hours said 11-9 today (Saturday). Very casual with picnic table seating and bagged single serve potato chips available. Don’t really see much else good wise but if they add a menu like that at Bandit Brewery this would be the go to for all in the upper beaches area. "

Once inside, I sat at the Bar, in the left stool behind the door. The place was busy and I understood and patiently waited for a beer. Although there was one gentleman pouring beer two others were washing dishes. I said to Ricardo, after being overlooked several times, does this seat not get service. Ricardo rudely replied “ I don’t know I’m busy doing dishes!” I was shocked! This is the first bad experience I’ve had at a Left Field and would suggest that the owners have him customer service training!

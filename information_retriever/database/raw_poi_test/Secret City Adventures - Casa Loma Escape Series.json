Our group was a combination of folks who had done escape rooms before and several first timers and we all had a BLAST. Even the escape room veterans agreed this was by far the best of any they’d ever done. A couple of us were big Murdoch fans, but most weren’t familiar with the show, and the game was super fun either way. There’s plenty enough activity to keep everyone busy, and the only “complaint” was that that meant not everyone got a chance to see everything. The set design and clues are really well done. It was fun interacting with the actors, and they were very helpful without giving anything explicitly away. We would absolutely recommend the experience and are making plans to try more of the Casa Loma escape rooms now!"

Once we started, the actors were so animated and so involved, they really made us feel part of an actual quest.

  "description": "The Princess of Wales Theatre is a 2000-seat playhouse built by the father and son producing team of David and Ed Mirvish, just a block away from their historic Royal Alexandra Theatre. The Princess of Wales is the first privately owned and financed theatre built in Canada since 1907 - and the first anywhere in North America in over 30 years. Construction began on August 6, 1991, and the building opened to the public with the musical Miss Saigon on May 26, 1993.The theatre was built with maximum flexibility in mind. Its stage is one of the widest and deepest in North America - large enough to accommodate the most spectacular theatrical productions - and its technical facilities are state-of-the-art.",

        "I visited the Princess of Wales Theatre in June, 2022 to see & Juliet just as pandemic restrictions in indoor spaces were easing. At the time of my visit, the province-wide mask mandate had been removed in most indoor settings, however individual public venues had the option of continuing to enforce a mask mandate which the Mirvish Theatres had when I was there. ",
        "In my opinion, the staff at the Princess of Wales Theatre did a wonderful job with balancing the public's desire for a return to normalcy while also reminding patrons of their responsibility to do the right thing for themselves and others. ",
        "They did this by offering a judgement free environment- if you came without a mask, an usher would provide one- no questions asked. Secondly, patrons were allowed to purchase snacks and drinks and consume them at their seats. Third, before the show, ushers would go by each row to provide non-verbal cues to patrons that once they finished their snacks and drinks to please put their masks back on. ",
        "The show itself was spectacular. It was age inclusive, it was performed by an extremely talented cast, the music was amazing and by the end the entire crowd was on it's feet dancing and singing along. After two long and exhausting years of not being able to experience live theatre, this show was the perfect way to welcome people back and invite them once again to engage with one of the many experiences that makes Toronto such a special place to be."

      "text": [
        "We love this theater and there are few complaints to be made however for newcomers there is one suggestion I would make. Do not sit front row balcony. There is a safety rope running across the front and it impedes your vision. How much so depends on which show you're seeing. We sat there for a Les Mis production and found the rope to be very annoying and visually impairing. Maybe if you are very tall it wouldn't matter but for shorter people or a child, stay away from these seats. The front row dress circle is much much better. Other than that this is a beautiful theater with lovely architecture and professional staff."

While there is an elevator, there are not enough washrooms available for the number of guests. Intermission is only 20 minutes which is not enough time to get to the washroom if you are a floor without them.  We took my parents, my mom has mobility issues. There is an elevator. The washroom lines were insane. Women were using the men's washroom. This is not okay for elderly guests. Start the show earlier and extend the intermission."

Music, dance, instrumentalists, not to forget the ever-present drummer-the real maestro of the show, brought it all together for a masterful 25th anniversary show! ",

Not a lot of options etc‚Ä¶ they should look at the UK theatres where you can order to your seat at the intermission etc would be more convenient for the customer and they would make more $$$ in the long run.  They also need to open the theatre earlier having to stand around in a small lobby is very inconvenient, and not COVID friendly not that matters to me but I can see it concerning to others.

I purchased my ticket in advance at the box office because I wanted to discuss seating and the best seat available.  Unfortunately, once the show began, I could not see. Actors often perform center stage.  But I could only see if the actors were standing stage right or stage left. The person seated in front of me blocked my view completely (no fault of the patron). I spent much of the show trying to see around the person in front of me, which likely affected the person behind me. This is a seating design issue.

For this Venue I would suggest seating in Balcony first row to row 4 maybe center stage or just off to the side. Great view of stage and performers."

        "Was supposed to see Hamiton with my Daughter on February 21st...she is a huge Hamilton Fan..unfortunately we were unable to attend due to the winter storm. Theater is not reimbursing our tickets. I understand that this is their policy and that the \"show must go on\" but considering the extreme dangerous weather and driving conditions I think there should be a exception made.",

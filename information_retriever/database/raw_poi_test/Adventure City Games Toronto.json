After sitting in meetings all day, we wanted something that got us up and moving, plus progressed us towards our dinner plans.  This activity worked perfectly, and we had a ton of fun along the way.  We played against each other in smaller teams with staggered start times.  We all learned something about the city that we didn't know, got to see some sights that many had not yet seen, and both teams were successful (despite some team-on-team sabotage taking place).  I would definitely recommend this activity as it works well for locals and travelers!  Thanks for the efforts in putting it together."

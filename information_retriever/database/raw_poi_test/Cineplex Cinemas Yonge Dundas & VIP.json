        "We loved the VIP experience. They kept everyone socially distanced and extensively sanitized the theater between movies. You do need to buy your tickets ahead of time so you can sit together otherwise if you wait you’ll be stuck with whatever seats are left. And since the theaters aren’t at full capacity that would be a problem if there’s more than one person in your party. Popcorn was good."

Ofcourse you can ask around but if you dont you might end up buying popcorn and a hotdog before you realize you can order from a menu in your seat; which was awesome. We’re not used to such a concept. Had a power salad (it was named something like that) and truffle fries. The food was okay. The cocktail was very good and also very large. The seats are very good. Not as good as the full-flat ones but nevertheless very good.",

I had to repeat my order five times- yes, five times to finally get it through their heads. How hard is it to read a coupon and scan a bar code from it for Pete's sake?  Mind you, my movie had already started.  Then to boot, they didn't bloody raise the volume after the ads in the cinema once the movie started.  I left twice to tell someone and finally I caught the manager and 40 minutes into the movie, he finally got the volume turned up so we could actually feel like we were in a cinema.  Sooo disappointing :("

        "My Uncle and I went to this very Nice Place it used to be Called AMC a while ago but Cineplex bought that out and things have Changed a bit like VIP and Ultra AVX theatres and did hear there is a special Cinima too that is very unique. We did the Ultra AVX atmos theatre with Speckers on the Celing and this was a fun Experence. We has to also go up a few Escalators to I think the third floor I'm not sure if there is a Elevator for Wheelchairs this may be a Probelm for you as I not sure if this place is Wheelchair Accessible. There are also Escalators going up to VIP and some other Theatres. I was on The main Floor when I came in to the place. maybe 20 to 26 cinemas Altogether there. Lots of great Choices there. It was a fun Experence and staff were nice and there was a sign for way out or exit too after the show. I recommend this place in downtown Toronto but Yonge St can be quit busy on weekdays or the odd Tuesday's but we got in no Trouble and Tuesday's are Cheeper if you want a better deal. I wasn't disappointed and you might find a very good film here of your choice. I found this a Little nicer then the other one Scotiabank Theatre Downtown. I preferred this one."

        "My friend and I went on a Wednesday for the VIP deal. It was a great experience. Neither of us had done VIP before. The price is pretty reasonable for what you get. For $50 we each got a ticket and a main meal. You go into a smaller more private theater, get a very comfy seat, and a server comes to take your order and answer any questions. We ordered alcoholic drinks (Caesar and a glass of wine). We ordered the pierogi starter (which i do not recommend, they were over hard). Then we each ordered a main; my friend got the chicken strips w fries which she said was good, I ordered the pulled pork burger which was really good w fries. The food came quite quickly. We arrived early so we had time to sort everything out and eat most of our food. When the movie starts, all the lights go out as usual, so if you still have food to eat, you will be eating in the dark/movie lighting. ",

In IMAX it's terrible. You pay extra for the big screen and they give you a platform to sit on and your family or friends are seated way below you. It's like a small island of isolation. Other theatres have the accessible seating way close. None have centre seating. We are way behind the USofA when it comes to seating in movie theatres in regards to availability and choice.

The burger patties were overcooked and dried out and the meal in general was so poorly done that I would have returned it if I wasn't sitting in a dark theatre watching a movie. The other thing I noticed is that the seats in the Yonge and Dundas VIP theatre, while very comfortable, do not fully recline like at the VIP at Yonge and Eglinton. So while it is an okay or average VIP theatre you will enjoy the food and seating much more at the Yonge and Eglinton location which I previously reviewed."

We were let into the theater 30 minutes before showtime where Andrew Phung arrived and took photos with everyone who lined up. Simu Liu came during the trailers. Although I wasn’t impressed with the film, finding it to be just decent as I felt that it was over-the-top, shallow, and vapid with questionable plot points, the experience of watching the film with the two celebrities, which livened the atmosphere was great as there would be cheering throughout the film. The sound quality was good. The picture quality was also good, but towards the end, the film got a bit blurry for a few minutes. Overall, it was a great moviegoing experience!"

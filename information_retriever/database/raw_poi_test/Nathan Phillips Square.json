The reflecting pool becomes a skating rink in the winter. The Peace Shrine is a replica of that in Hiroshima. Tucked away in the northwest corner is a state of Winston Churchill."

        "Prior to our cruise of the Great Lakes with Viking (a story in itself), we stayed right off Younge at the Omni King Edward which is a great location, surrounded by restaurants.  We flew in Monday night, too late to do anything, but on Tuesday we’re off to the art museum.  It was very good, but not a Met, nor even as good as Chicago’s Institute.  We nearly walked by the 7.  It wasn’t highlighted. Very nice restaurant and gift shop.  On Wednesday, we walked and walked and walked.  Toronto is a beautiful city,  easier to walk in than NYC.  We did 15000 steps from our hotel up Younge.  The architecture is wonderful with old 20th century buildings kissing brand new glass behemoths.  Then we walked to city hall and the Toronto sign. From there we headed to the Asian area via Queen.  Boutiques use the first floor of old cottages.  Photos galore.  We were surprised that so many Asian restaurants were closed at lunchtime.  Many open at 4.  We stopped in at Gwartzman’s to look at art supplies.  They have some wonderful Canadian suppliers.  From there we headed to the CN tower.  Not to be missed.  Tickets and the Line took about 45 minutes at 4 pm.  We stayed about an hour and made the mistake of going to the upper level as well.  Total waste.  Less of a view because there are structural beams at eye level.  Wish someone had mentioned that in a Toronto posting.  We had a terrible time leaving the area because of a very fast ball game next door.  The Blue Jays stadium is next to the tower.  The police shut down the river side street so we couldn’t get a ride.  Traffic on the other surrounding streets were at a standstill.  It took us an hour to find a ride and move 3 blocks.  Dumb move.  We should have just walked north, but my feet were screaming.  On Thursday we went to the Royal Ontario museum.  Fabulous.  The dinosaurs.  Wow.  Loved the museum. High, high, highly recommend it.  ",
        "The only restaurant I’d recommend is a local place that was delicious. Le Papillon on Front.  And for breakfast, the croissants, sandwiches, and other goodies at Au Pain Dore were better than any I had in Paris."

        "The ancient Victorian city hall (on the east side) is infinitely more architecturally attractive.  Somehow, it has miraculously survived the wrecking cranes  -- with a tallish clock tower, and a bell that rings the time accurately, every fifteen minutes... most of the time. ",
        "On the west side is Osgoode Hall, surrounded by a beautiful (but successfully imposing) 19th-century rot iron fence. It's home to the Law Society of Upper Canada. Unless you're a lawyer, don't even begin to ask what that means, or who they are....  Simply trying to get into the buidling could result in an immediate ticket to JAIL -- Do not pass GO!  Do not collect $200!",
        "To the south is Queen Street -- a major east/west throroughfare, with one of the city's very few 24-hour StreetCar routes.  It will take you from \"the Beaches\" in the extreme east end,  to almost any destination you can possibly image in the wild, Wild West.",
        "It's twenty-five kilometres long, and would provide an excellent -- and CHEAP! -- first-time tourist introduction to many aspects of the contemporary city. ",
        "In the NW quarter of Nathan Phillips Square is a large bronze scupture called \"The Archer\" by British artist Henry Moore. It was commissioned by Toronto City Council, under then Mayor Nathan Phillips, when the new city hall was being  planned and built. The Archer alone is worth the price of admission -- which happens to be free, 24/7, twelve months of the year. ",
        "Shortly after the piece was commissioned, the city fathers learned that Mr. Moore had already agreed to sell  and  send a  second bronze  casting of the same piece to another city , somewhere in Scandinavia. When the good citzens of \"Toronto the Good\" got wind of this artistic dupliity, they rose up and raised significant funds -- several millions of dollars, by today's standards! -- to compensate the  creator for any out-out-pocket expenses he might incur by not making a copy....",
        "Moore was so impressed that he later donated the bulk of his lifelong sculptural output to the Art Gallery of Ontario, which is within walking distance of \"The Square\" itself!",
        "By far the best time to visit is in the middle of a cold  Canadian winter, when the sizeable reflecting pool in the middle is magically transformed into a public skating rink. Recent mmigrants from around the world lace up rented blades, and achieve honourary Canadian citizenship  by ankle  skating --  with  smiles  that stretch from ear-to-ear, for hours and hours! ",

        "We were at U of T St. George Campus on Sat, Oct 5, for the 11AM campus tour (signed up online weeks earlier). We registered at Nona Macdonald Visitors Centre and, since we had a few mins to spare, used the washrooms while we waited for the tour to begin (no washroom break during the tour). The lobby was standing room only by the time one student staff made a brief introduction and proceeded to divide the tour participants into smaller groups. Our tour group consisted of 5 prospective students and 9 accompanying family members while third year Civil Engineering student Nicole served as our guide. ",
        "The general campus tour covered 7 colleges, a library, a sport facility, a dormitory-style residence, an activity centre, a park and more. It is a predominantly outdoor walk—it took us more than 2 hours to cover 3.5 km (we did not even see half of the campus)—so comfy shoes and weather-appropriate clothing are recommended. Although we did set foot inside a few building lobbies, we never lingered, sometimes just passing through. The one time we were indoors somewhat longer was at the residence. Here we climbed the stairs to the second floor and walked single file in and out a 2-bed dormitory room while the current student resident held the door open.  ",
        "Overall, it was an informative and interesting tour. Our guide did a great job and her enthusiasm and school pride was obvious. We learned fun facts which would not have been readily known to us if we walked around U of T on our own. We will likely be back another time to leisurely explore the campus grounds and see more of the beautiful architecture."

We walked a lot around the entirety of the Hart House and very much enjoyed the grounds and beautiful buildings. There were some people apparently filming some sort of music video while we were there. We found two outdoor spots that were in Tommy Boy but I was really excited to find the door he tried to open. Unfortunately, I believe it’s behind locked gates in a construction zone. One of the gates has a sign saying construction is expected to be done September 2021 so it was a little annoying to have it still locked up in August 2022 but it is what it is. Still a beautiful campus. Also, sorry if you’re like the people I asked on campus and have no idea what Tommy Boy is. This review will be very confusing for you. Haha."

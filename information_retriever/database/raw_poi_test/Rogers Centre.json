Helps to brush up on the basic rules of baseball beforehand but you don't need to be an expert to follow what's going on. You also don't need to pay a fortune either. I'm sure the expensive seats near the dugouts are great but I went for the cheaper $50 ones and the view was perfectly acceptable (see attached picture). Only negative was cost of some of the merchandise. Match shirts were an eye-watering $200+ although you can find plenty of cheaper options."

Ridiculously expensive beer and stuff, but that’s pretty much every arena at this point. Hard to get a bad seat here too.

We disembarked and needed to walk around the stadium to find our gate. Check in was fine and we were directed to our seats in the 200 level. The seats are small, hard and uncomfortable. They also faced the left fielder so to watch the play you needed to keep your head turned left or attempt to sit sideways. Next day I had a sore back and stiff neck. The intensity of the lights was also bothersome. We sat in an area with our own lounge. The prices are astronomical. A can of beer,$15.00 a glass of wine $23.00. Exiting was also a slow and crowded process. I'll really need to think about attending another game."

The main reason for the 3 is because for some reason, every stadium is now going cashless. That in and of itself wouldn't be an issue but someone at the Rogers Center felt that 3 cash conversion machines would be enough for a stadium that seats thousands of people. That being said, out of the 3 machines in the stadium (1 on the 100 level, in the Jays Store, the other on the opposite side on the 100 level and the 3rd machine on the 500 level) the ONLY one that worked was on the 500 level!!! The sad part is that even THAT machine wasn't working properly! The staff at the fan service desk were great though. They helped everyone that needed help even though more than a few people were getting upset with the machine not working properly. Overall, it was a fun day at the park, just didn't expect to have to walk from the 200 level to the 100 level and walk the entire level and then have to walk to the 500 level and back down to the 200 level BEFORE the game even started!! Bluejays and MLB, if you want to be cashless make sure you have enough WORKING cash conversion machines to service a stadium full of fans!! Do better!!!!!!!!"

The seats were definitely more comfortable, but again the colour scheme makes for a dark feel.  Give me the powder blue Blue Jay colouring with some of the amenities they’ve put in and it would feel a lot better and much tolerable to overpay the terrible concession prices.  $32 for two beers is steep.  $12ish for a foot long, nothing special hot dog.  It does hurt the pocketbook, for sure!  Love my baseball, but this renovation has missed the Mark (no thanks Shapiro)!"

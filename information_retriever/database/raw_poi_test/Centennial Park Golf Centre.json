  "description": "Etobicoke is a relaxed area along the Humber River. It's saturated with green spaces and conservatories, making it a premier destination for outdoor sports, hiking, and nature walks. Its abundance of parkland and lakes makes it a typical spot for fishing, picnicking, and camping out, especially in warmer months. The peaceful area is also enjoyed by families, who appreciate its boardwalks and sports facilities. Locals enjoy the variety of golfing and country club opportunities, which also provide lessons for golfers of any skill level.",

The first day we went for a 45 min run and the second day we just went back and walked. The running paths were great and the park was very busy with other exercisers and other people doing lots of different activities. This park is an athletes paradise. The park looks well maintained and safe. When back in the area we'll visit again."

One of them broke and the rest were in rough shape.  When a staff member was told about the club being broken, it was \"okay, man.\"  No apologies, not even a check to make sure where the rest of the club was.  The mats were in decent shape, but many of them were missing tees, which led to a scavenger hunt to lift up other mats to get tees.  Located in Etobicoke, right on the border of Mississauga, the Centennial Park Golf Centre is more for beginners that established golfers."

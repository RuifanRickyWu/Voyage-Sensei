Marcus and Patrick were excellent in giving instructions, hints and very accommodating to me who was with a cane and a scooter. Brian was great behind the bar. Their smiles were great, their personality is excellent for customer service work. You do get to find out who is competitive at your work. I also thought it was great they have pink t-shirts and any profit goes to non-bullying (may not be the right words but you get my drift). Thank you for a fun day."

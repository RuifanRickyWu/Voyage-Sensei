Complete strangers worked together so well that we were able to find the agent literally in the last second. AMAZING!!"

        "I don't dispute that this experience may be enjoyable for others, but it was not for me. I'll try in this review to reveal the elements that were not up to my expectations and hopefully this will help readers decide whether it's for them. ",
        "My party did The Dragon's Song escape at Casa Loma. This experience included two live actors who were with you in the room the entire time, and 'guided' the experience. When I say guided, what i mean was that they interfered with puzzle solvers, and would practically solve the puzzles for some people. This would be lovely if I had signed up for dinner theatre. The actors obviously were enthusiastic and talented, however when I sign up for a room escape, I would rather fail than have my hand held. This is poor design.",
        "We had a party of six, and the rooms are designed for more, so other players are thrust together with you into a team.  In this room, at the beginning of each level of the tower, four puzzles were available at a time,  and worked mostly independently of one another. In my eyes, this created two problems, which only existed to try solve the problem of trying to fit too many players into the room at once in order to drive higher profitability. When I go to a room escape, I would like to be aware of the puzzles my team has worked through, and develop some understanding of how they worked and what needed to be done to solve them, even if I was not a major contributor to that particular puzzle. When 4 puzzles are being solved independently, the individual player is unlikely to be even able to see how each works, let alone contribute in any meaningful way to the majority of puzzles. When most of the puzzles are solved in a level the players who are not working on the final puzzle have two options, to politely wait around for the last group working on it to have some success, or for a dozen or more people to crowd around and catch up on what's been going on. ",
        "Lastly, at the beginning of the game, a Game Master (or MC as they called them) *specifically* instructed the group that there would be no clues on the walls. Normally, revealing the inner workings of a clue in an escape game online would be against my sacred code, however, in this game, there *was* a clue that was on a loose brick in the wall. While the instructions given may have meant to communicate that graffiti on the walls would not contain written clues, the MC instructed players (repeatedly) that 'there will be no clues on the walls.' Please train your staff as our team wasted a lot of time at this stage, mainly due to these incorrect instructions. ",
        "The decor and theme were impeccable, and there was a lot of attention to detail in props, you can tell that the designers took great care to design an aesthetically pleasing and immersive experience.",
        "In conclusion, if you are looking for an active, participatory experience, and are tired of things like the medieval times, this may be a wonderful activity for you and your group. If you are an experienced and driven escape gamer, I would advise looking at alternative options."

First, let me talk about Jesse - the host with the most. Engaging and hilarious - loved him!! All the staff/cast members were fantastic - a perfect blend of serious/believable and funny/helpful. The puzzles/clues were definitely hard enough to be challenging but the fact that you really have the answers at your fingertips if you know how to look for them was great. It was pretty creepy at first with the masked, cloaked characters walking around but not too scary for the wimpy people like me.",

        "They put you into groups of 6 so we tried to round up a group of 6 to book at one time so we would be grouped together. If you aren't afraid to make new friends, then that's all good too but we liked working with people we knew because we knew each other's strengths and were able to divvy up tasks according to who worked well together (we're a slightly competitive bunch) :)",
        "We booked online and you are given an email confirmation along with reminders. We were familiar with Pioneer Village so the paths are gravel and uneven so it may not be good for those in wheelchairs or folks that have trouble walking on uneven ground (Especially in the dark if you choose the later time, which we did).",
        "The darkness gives an extra feel of spookiness but no one jumps out at you - it isn't a haunted house, it's an escape game. The tasks were challenging enough and pretty cool how to piece them together for your answers but staff will give some hints where they are allowed so you aren't left feeling completely stupid and frustrated. Most escape rooms give you two questions and then you can spend your time staring at each other when you're stuck.",
        "At the end of the evening, our host Jesse explained if you choose to repeat this escape game, they have a few variations so I may try this one again although I am eager to try their other locations before returning to this one. They also have their banner and some robes for a photo op with your group at the end too. Love photo ops!!",
        "Fantastic, loved it!",

Everyone does get to see the end feature though. 10 groups of 5 or 6 go out at the same time, starting in different buildings of Black Creek Pioneer Village. They have a 5:45 escape and an 8:45 escape, we did the 8:45 one so it would be darker and spookier. You solve puzzles (if you can) and move around the grounds. There are villagers around every task to aid you. Creepy guys in masks wander around and appear in windows. It was very creepy at first, but by the end we were having a laugh. We had a lot of fun and some puzzles we got right away, but a couple we needed hints. Only 2 groups of the 10 completed the escape. ",

I don't know now if i'll enjoy the traditional escape rooms where you're just in a room with stuff. It's kind of like the old murder mysteries. I'm excited to try some of their other escape experiences around Toronto and do this one again until I complete it!"

We knew this ahead of time and of course it is understandable  from a business perspective but we didn’t like it.  Our paired group was not fun or chatty at all. So MUCH better if u can get your own group of six people and go together.  We are fatties but it was no problem. There is a bit of walking bending reaching etc. So wear comfortable shoes and clothing.  The puzzles were tricky and sort of nonsensical but always someone there to help. Few times literally had to be told what to do because we were clueless as to what the puzzle was asking us.  Haha.  The staff/actors were awesome. No touching allowed so that was comforting too but they are lurking around. You don’t have to interact with them if you don’t want to.  No pressure.  Just being in the surroundings was so cool.  Big group of participants but never ran into another group due to excellent planning I’m sure. Pay for your parking as you drive out. Pay station to the left.  It was 7 dollars.   We loved it even though I think we finished last."

Next, it’s interactive with staff - it’s a full-blown theatrical production. Also, your team plays against other teams who you may or may not know, adding another level of challenge. The puzzles are great and the coordination is superb as we never even got close to one of the other teams as we were moving around the village. It’s creepy, and tense, and challenging and, lastly, everyone gets to join in at the end and feel like they solved it, even if they didn’t. Staff is awesome. Great event for friends, family, or work colleagues - the bigger the group, the better! Suggest arriving 15 minutes early. Parking available on site for $7 - get a ticket and pay at exit. "

        "Wow! I’ve done escape rooms before but taking the experience outside in the dark puts things in a entirely different realm! We had a team of two and were paired with 4 strangers who quickly became friends as we worked our way through the puzzles.  The actors throughout the game were great -if a times a tad over-dramatic (but that just added to the experience!) Simply put, Where The Dark Things Dwell is fantastic. Just the right level of difficulty.  I don’t want to spoil any of the game in this, so without going into detail I’ll just say, do yourself a favour and check this out for yourself!"

        "Our group of six escapers had an amazing time last month doing this escape room. It's a high cost compared to other rooms but you'll quickly see why once you're there. The actors are great, the cultists are great, and the puzzles were challenging, unique, and a lot of fun. The staff in the room were great at pointing you in the right direction while in character but not giving everything away, major props to the schoolmaster who was a standout act that night (don't know his name, he has a Scottish accent). Definitely not for the lighthearted but not too scary: I'm a self-confessed chicken and it was just enough spooky to be hilarious rather than terrifying. Without giving anything away, there could be some improvement on the latter half of the game just to make sure all group members are actually needed/included. It goes from being a setup for six people to something 2-3 could've done on their own which is a little frustrating but overall still an amazing experience. Love that there's a replayability to it as well, will definitely be going back."

Not only was this amazing, but you can do this again and have a totally different experience as there are 10 puzzles rooms and you only do 2 of them per visit."

        "Honestly would have been 5 stars but about half way into our game, one of the actors asked us if we had something from one of the stations. We said no and then felt like we should have and needed them. We did not need them though. About 5 minutes later, our host came up and actually accused us, did not ask or inquire he told me I had something I should not have. He got lucky he would have got a mouth full.",

He saw the look on my face like no, you are responsible for keeping track of your inventory. You need to investigate your colleagues before you come accusing the people trying to have fun and play the game."

        "I have done 69 escape rooms worldwide, and this is the best one I've ever done.  It's not really an escape room since it involves all of Black Creek Pioneer Village, but more like an escape experience.  I had previously done Secret City Adventure's Tower room at Casa Loma and loved it so I had high hopes for Where Dark Things Well, and all my expectations were well exceeded.",
        "Many of the reviews below me already cover the salient points so I won't beat it to death, but everything is spot on about this game, from the actors, to the puzzles, to the way it all comes together in the end.",
        "I have 2 major recommendations:",
        "1) Do the 9 pm game not the 6 pm game.  We are so glad we did.  This experience wouldn't be nearly the same in sunlight.  But at night it's spooky and awesome.  The lanterns they provide offer enough light to do the puzzles.  I'm sure it's a little easier in daylight, but you're not hear for easy, you're here for AWESOME.",
        "2) Bring a full team of 6 people.  We were out of town tourists but just so happened to have exactly a group of 6, which was perfect.  If you have fewer than 6, they'll pair you up with strangers, which obviously can be hit or miss depending on who you get matched with.  I was much more comfortable being with good friends who I could yell at when they didn't do things correctly. :)  If you have more than 6 they'll split you up into multiple teams so don't do that either."

The pioneer village makes an amazing backdrop and really helps you get into the story. The actors were great and being able to explore the village at night by lantern light was incredible. The puzzles were really well thought out and kept with the theme and had a great range of difficulty. Can't recommend this enough. Go for the 9pm game. You want the dark!!"

        "First, Niagara Falls is beautiful and I liked that part of the tour.  But, the tour company was terrible.  We had called them first and they said they would pick us up from our hotel, but we had to make reservations on their website.  The website even has a spot for hotel pick-up.  But then, it turns out that they don't pick up from your hotel; they only have designated pick-ups locations (which is fine, but they shouldn't say they pick up from a hotel if they don't).  Then, the driver/tour guide was very hard to understand, and he did not make things very clear about how long stops were going to be, or where he was going to pick us up.  We had to ask him several times to clarify these things. Finally, we stopped at a couple of places that were not very interesting, but apparently are routine places to stop on this tour.  Having more time at the Falls would be time better spent. ",
        "Bottom line is the Niagara Falls is fun to visit (a bit crowded, even in the fall), but don't use this tour company."

Don’t buy the back by dinner song-and-dance. There is just no way. Just plan this for the whole day, and eat dinner at your hotel at 10pm when you get back to Toronto."

After short trip to the beautiful Niagara by the Lake with a stop to enjoy this lovely place.  Simply thats was a great tour which I believe enjoyed by all the group despite the weather.

My fiance is in a wheelchair and cannot walk nor stand and although I am capable of transfering him in and out of his chair myself, Tudy was extremely kind, attentive and helpful and did it all himself on every single stop during our tour, saving me from a lot of physical work. I cannot emphasize how grateful I am with Tudy's kindness and exceptional service; he is not only an excellent driver and a wise and studied tour guide but also a great human being! This trip is something I will forever treasure in my heart. Thank you for your service, Tudy!"

The Falls and the boat ride were an amazing experience though Niagara Falls resort is just a place to spend money! One suggestion - we liked Niagara-on-the-Lake and wanted to stay there longer - 45 minutes not enough. Maybe leave out winery - really a waste of time - and Floral Clock and Souvenir City. All in all it was very good value (77 dollars each) for an eleven hour trip!",

Nora was very friendly and polite she explained the complete itinerary on call and offer the best package to us. Driver show up on time to pick us, Total trip did take about 6 hours and not once did we feel rushed to exit an attraction. Royal tours have your itinerary planned out very well, the amount of time allotted per attraction is reasonable. Our tour guide Ronnie, was great. Very knowledgeable and friendly. It was an amazing experience and we had a great tour. Thanks a lot Nora, Ronnie and Don for providing us a good service... :)"

        "Checked out all the reviews before booking with Royal Tours., and was very happy with my choice.  The driver picked us up on time and would even call people to check on them if they weren't waiting when he came.  It wasn't a hot day, but he did have a cooler with free, bottled water.  We had 45 minutes in Niagra on The Lake.  Would have loved a longer time there.  It's such a lovely little town with shops and nice restaurants.  Our stop at the winery for a tasting was enjoyable and informative.  We even had a chance to sample a few grapes from the vines, which are marked with the type of wine they make from that grape.  We had 3.5 hours at the falls.  Plenty of time to have lunch, see the falls and wander around all the tourist attractions.  There's even a casino.  Most of the people on the tour did the Maid of the Mist boat ride, but I didn't want to get wet.  The poncho doesn't protect everything.  We were picked up at 8:30 a.m. and dropped off at 6:00.  We had a very enjoyable day and I recommend this company."

The tour guide was also very informative and I learned a lot of new things. The best part I would say is how, its a tour, however, it doesn't really feel like one. There is a lot of flexibility and they make it very customer oriented. I would recommend to anyone who would like a tour but without the restrictions."

        "My fiance and I wanted to see Niagara falls and this had even extra things that we didn't really consider prior to. First off I'm a paraplegic, normally they only do pick ups from downtown Toronto and we were in North York, but they picked us up anyway and the van was just for us so it was basically a romantic private tour. By far the best part of the tour itself was the driver Tudy. When you schedule this tour I recommend personally requesting him as a driver. Not only was he incredibly friendly, personable, knowledgeable about every area and every part of the tour, but even more incredibly and something he absolutely didn't have to do and most uber/taxi drivers don't... Keeping in mind I'm a paraplegic, EVERY TIME we got in and out of the fan he personally carried me out to put me in my chair and the same back in the van, at least a total of 8 times and I'd bet none of the other drivers would have. Normally they leave it to my female fiance to do it by herself, not to mention carry the wheelchair, put it together etc. He saved her so much work and he volunteered to do it on his own, he was an amazing guide. So if you want the best request him, especially if you have a disability. The tour was beautiful, everything amazing even in the freezing winter on our first trip to canda. The only complaint is it is a bit expensive, but I can't imagine how much doing it all yourself would cost. Also we did the afternoon/evening trip and the lights at night we're beautiful especially being on a date. All in all I absolutely recommend this and thank you Tudy for a wonderful tou"

        "We were in Toronto for a Gift Show and had Saturday free to check out the sites so my friend and I decided to go to Niagara Falls.  We did have access to a vehicle but thought it would be easier to have a guide since both of us had not been to the Niagara area before.  I am so glad we did.  From the minute our guide Tudy, picked us up from our airport hotel in a newer model Dodge Caravan, (on time and only 3 in our group), our adventure was on the way.  We stopped Niagara on the Lake, beautiful little town, Reif winery for some wine tasting and good value wines, onward to some shopping at Souvenir City (good deals).  We stopped at more interesting locations and then decided to have lunch at Taps on Queens in Old Niagara.  The tour also includes entry to Skylon Tower for breathtaking views of Niagara Falls. The roar of the falls is amazing.  We were returned to our hotels at 6 p.m.  All in all a great trip and a great thanks to Tudy and Royal Tours I highly recommend this tour!"

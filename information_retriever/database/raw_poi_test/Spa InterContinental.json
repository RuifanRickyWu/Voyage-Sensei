It was easy to get to via bike, and we had a place to park or bikes. The staff were all very friendly and helpful. Kenneth was our RMT, and he was phenomenal. He understood completely which muscles needed attention, and expertly avoided the road rash on my leg. The pool and amenities were excellent. I would highly recommend a spa visit here."

        "My husband and I came here for a couples massage and the whole experience left us disappointed.  The massages themselves were great, so no issue there.  However, it REALLY falls short of being a relaxing day spa.  You obviously pay a premium (vs. just visiting a regular MT at their office) because of the facilities, and they were pretty bad.  As I now see in reviews, the hot tub and pool are shared with the hotel- kids splashing don't exactly make for a zen experience.  The steam rooms were located in the change rooms, so we couldn't go together.  The space is very dated, bad patchwork to holes in the walls, washroom elements falling apart.  After our massages, we basically spent 10 minutes in hot tub and then left since it was the opposite of what we were looking/hoping for."

We were show to the change room were we were provided with a locker with a robe, towel and slippers.  We had time for a swim, jacuzzi and steam bath before our massage.  The waiting area had orange and lemon water, tea and fresh fruit.  The massage table was very comfortable and both RMT’s gave great massages.  We left feeling relaxed and rejuvenated.  Next we had pedicures.  The room was nice with two massaging chairs.  They ended with a lovely salt scrub on feet and lower legs and then a foot massage.  Afterward we sat outside on the deck and enjoyed wine and a cheese plate.  ",

The 50 minute massage was certainly a deep tissue massage, but the plate of fresh fruit and cheese afterwards, with fruit infused water was a nice and unexpected touch. We then followed that up with a steam and it was perfect. "

        "My friend and I had the pleasure of visiting and enjoying a few hours at the hotel spa this past weekend. I love spas and always have a hard time finding a place that is affordable and that staff actually enjoy their work. Good news is that I enjoyed the Intercontinental Spa and was more than satisfied with the service and staff. Here are the details. When we arrived, we were welcomed and directed to the locker room area where we were given robes and slippers (good quality robes and slippers..which one believes should be the norm in all spas, but you'd be surprise how this is not a standard for many places). We were then escorted to the spa area where we were offered lemon water and filled out the normal paper-work. My masseuse was named Kobi and he was just fantastic! Very knowledgeable, respectful, engageing, and best of all gave me an awesome massage! He focused on my areas of need and he even took the time to explain exercises that I should do to minimize the stress and knots that accumulate on my upper back. Who does that? I've been to countless spas in Toronto and very few people actually take the time to recommend exercises and poses to help minimize stress. This information was all given after the massage was already done and I was ready to leave the massage room. In most spas you're basically given a massage and once they are done, the masseuse walks out of the room and you don't see them anymore. Kobi stayed outside the door and  took me back to the front area to drink some tea and enjoy some time in the pool, jacuzzi, and also the steam room. These are the perks of getting a treatment at this spa, you're able to hang out and stay to enjoy the other hotel facilities. Most spas downtown don't have these perks and for the price of the massage, which includes using all spa hotel facilities, I found this to be a great investment. When you go to the Intercontinental Spa you feel like you actually enjoyed a few hours of total relaxation and pampering, without having to leave the city. You leave this place feeling energized, stress-free, and full of positive vibes. By the way, for $25 dollars anyone can enter the spa area and enjoy the pool, jacuzzi, steam room and deck area."

Her kindness and professionalism made me feel 100% relaxed and pampered, and the treatment made my skin unbelievably smooth. ",

They didn't rush us out at all, and it was great to chat and relax with my sister after our individual treatments. We enjoyed the hot tub and saltwater pool, and of course the Aveda products in the showers too! We will be back to this spa, for sure."

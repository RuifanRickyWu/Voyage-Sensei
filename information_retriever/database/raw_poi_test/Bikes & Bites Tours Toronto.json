Amazing what you can see on a bike in just 4 hours !  The best part of the tour was Sean. He‚Äôs a wonderful guy that wants to share his love for the city.  Very informative, funny and pleasant to be with. It was a perfect family activity and we were 2 adults and 4 kids (age 13-17). This tour is a must when visiting. Thanks Sean !

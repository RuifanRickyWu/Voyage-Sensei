The trip on the coach was good and thoroughly enjoyed the two stops before the falls (Whirlpool rapids and the Canadian Maple syrup tasting). Then onto the falls themselves for a spectacular boat trip into the basin of the falls amd headlong into the mist. Truly breathtaking. Would highly recommend this tour and Haroon as a guide. A must do if in Toronto."

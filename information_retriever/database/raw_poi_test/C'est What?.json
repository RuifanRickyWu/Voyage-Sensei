As we plan this year's trip, I was reminded of this dapper pub/restaurant we found by accident last year. The C'est What staff didn't bat an eyelash when I told them our party was one of 16 and a half (think high chair). They hustled to push tables together, sat us promptly and took our drinks order. Returned with a great selection of craft beers including the much raved-about stout Steve's Dreaded Chocolate (from a 2-page beer menu) for the thirsty crowd. I wish I could remember what my kin had to eat because everyone damn near licked their plates. But husband and I shared with our crowd an enormous poutine appetizer that deserves high praise for its crisp fries, fresh cheese curds, and tasty slathering of gravy. Then I ordered the shepherd's pie (went by a fancy name I don't recall), and it was the best I've had outside of Ireland. Lots of minced lamb and beef with real, not frozen, veg, topped with a layer of flavorful mashed taters, cheese and caramelized onions. The portion could have easily been shared, and I gave tastes to many in our group so as to not waste a bite. What a great find for vacationing Americans. "

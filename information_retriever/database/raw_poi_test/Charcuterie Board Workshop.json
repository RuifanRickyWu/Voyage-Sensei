        "My husband bought me this workshop for my birthday back in August for Toronto location . After he bought them , he was told that that location was no longer available but changing to Niagara on the lake . So after trying to make it work we placed a date in Nov actually sat nov  18 to be exact . Planned the accommodation for that stay so our drive back and forth was not done as live in Vaughan 1. 5 approx away . Then the day before fri Nov 17 we received an email cancelling the said workshop . This now is the second time . I strongly recommend not to book anymore . We end up losing 149$ hotel . This disruption was not satisfactory. They should have let us know at least a few days before not the day before as it was too late . I will never book again . Please be aware ."

        "Diane seemingly performed magic while teaching us how to dress a charcuterie board, filled with delicious cheese and fruits and even how to fold coldcuts into little roses!!",
        "Then it was time for Sarah to host the woodworking: the walnut boards are incredibly solid yet light, and we had a blast sanding and using cool tools to whittle and oil our boards into something beautiful and original. ",
        "What a unique and worthwhile evening of fun, food, great value, and AMAZING HOSTS!!"

        "The host was personable and polite, very knowledgeable. I did a workshop with my sister at the end of August (a post birthday celebration). They discussed a lot care and products you can buy. The actual class was great and a fun experience but pricey.   I loved my board, however I never actually used it because I want to save it for a special occasion. A couple months passed and I noticed a split going down the center of my board. I messaged the woman I booked the class with and she didn't really seem to care and didn't offer any advice about how to fix it. She merely said that imperfections make our boards beautiful. Guess I should have just bought one from a big box store."

When we got there Sarah and her team made us feel so welcome and comfortable, they had wine for us and soon they gave us a lesson on how to set up a well balanced charcuterie board. Then we got to eat it! And then we picked out our special piece of live edge maple that would become our charcuterie board to take home. There was lots of instruction and even if you are not that comfortable around tools, there was lots of help and we all were helping each other! A great way to spend a Friday night with chill people!"

It was an intimate class size so you were able to interact with your fellow classmates. The class took place at The Custom Table workspace so I had a chance to tour the space which was beautiful and filled with beautiful pieces by the owner Sarah, I want to remodel my place now lol. Truly a fun experience that I would reco to anyone who likes entertaining at home. It's not often you have the opportunity to create something."

Everything was thought out and well put together; from creating the design of your board with the different meats and cheeses. Then using my hands to actually create my own board for my home. I also have one to give as a gift which i am thrilled about. Thank you so much for an amazing night - I hope to one day be able to build a table for my home."

Sarah is a delightful host who clearly loves what she does and knows her stuff. The charcuterie lesson before hand is a nice compliment so you can leave confident the next time you want to entertain. I went solo which was great as you get to meet great people but I can totally see this as a thing for couples or small groups. Take the plunge and get your hands dirty. You’ll leave with a smile and a great looking charcuterie board. Highly recommend!"

I learned so much, everyone who ran the event and the people who joined the class made it that much more enjoyable and comfortable. Sarah answered all my questions and made me feel like I had the best charcuterie board (even though she told everyone there’s was the best). If I could go to all the classes I would. I’m so excited to have my own wine and cheese parties because seriously my board is beautiful lol I have to show it off. GO SIGN UP!!! And show your boards off."

Then Sarah gives a brief description of the rest of the night.",

It was a professional, clean space and the instructor (Sarah) was knowledgeable and fun - she fosters a really comfortable space to learn and work in.

And then you get to eat it whilst drinking a glass of wine and Sarah explains a bit about the boards.  Now it's time to make them - Sarah walks you through each step and we get to work - it's not too difficult and the end result is unbelievable.  Considering how much you pay in a store for one of these boards - this is a much more cost effective way to do it and makes for a great night out!  Highly recommended! Thanks Sarah for a great night!"

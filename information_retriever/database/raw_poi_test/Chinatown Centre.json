  "description": "Toronto's main Chinatown has the honor of being the largest in North America. Gaping down across Dundas Street West and Spadina Avenue, the area is a wonderful medley of shops and restaurants, busy signs and bright red gates, a destination for foodie fun. Chinatown's streets are always bustling, packed with people and outdoor stalls hawking fresh produce and products. The restaurants and authentic marketplaces that shoulder in against each other display shining roast ducks and menus studded with dumplings and noodle bowls. The air is pervaded with music. different languages, and the smell of fried food and mouth-watering desserts. Chinatown's restaurants represent a broad range of fare, from traditional Szechuan and Shanghai foods, to other Asian delicacies, including some of the top Japanese, Vietnamese, and Korean spots in the city. Whether you're in the mood for a sit-down tea house or a bubble tea to go, Chinatown is the spot to enjoy an exciting walk and the promise of leaving satisfied.",

Don't get me wrong, there are lots of Chinese restaurants and little shops with the stuff we got used to see around the world yet here they do not have the massive Chinese pieces that scream at you 'Chinatown'.",

        "It ain't what it used to be 40 years ago but it is the heart of downtown chinatown where the old associations still exist on the back streets, grocery stores (cheap but good food), mid to low end restaurants, souvenir shops and massage spas galore.   Chinatown has evolved from being pre-dominantly Cantonese, to Vietnamese to Mandarin speaking - not all Chinese can communicate with each other anymore here.  This is the authentic soul of china in Toronto.",
        "There is a regeneration of shops up along Spadina, some traditional, some fusion - eclectic.  It is only a few blocks in size but it is thoroughly a melting pot of china.  Some recommended places - go to \"Homemade Ramen\" on the east side of Spadina, south of Dundas for real great chinese ramen made there fresh, dim sum at either Dim Sum King or Dragon City (3rd floor) though I prefer Bright Pearl in Chinatown East (IMHO, I think it is best dim sum in the city including Markham but too many to try in Markham).  For cheap but good eats, try House of Gourmet (can't beat the price, order one of the many rice or noodle dishes), King Noodle (similar).   For some reason, Mother Dumplings get good reviews but I think there is no flavour in their dumplings or soups.  ",

        "Toronto is a lovely multi cultural city but a word of warning \"Don't hire a car\" during your stay there as the parking is legalised robbery on a huge scale. You cannot park anywhere free and it is very expensive and so are the fines for parking $50 a time and even if your car is facing the wrong direction they ticket you with yet another $50 fine. Pubs tend to be expensive too for small measures for example 2 small beers and a coke $20 ! I expected the barmaid to be wearing a black mask. In general a good holiday but Canada needs to look seriously at their traffic laws. You get a green light to go around a corner and simultaneously the walk signal turns to \"Walk\" absolutely crazy system which I never will encounter ever again. Been there got the T shirt NEVER again."

        "Visiting Chinatown, it's shopping malls, products, foods, even toiletries for sale was great. When you come form an area of Canada with little diversity it is necessary once in a while to go beyond the every day and see another world. We do not always need to leave Canada. As a person who has visited China I could appreciate the little shops and trinkets. I think too often we need to return to a more basic lifestyle like Chinatown where community life is more local along with groceries and neighbours. These Canadians live in 2 worlds concurrently. The food was terrific and waitress helpful when we wanted to consult regarding food options we did not know.   I was also most pleased to find a lovely soap I am no longer ablt to find in my area and although I had to go to several stores looking for it I was successful. The hotel front office staff were really good at heading you in the right direction as they knew the area well."

In the downstairs food court was a stall called Citywok. It was so cheap. $5 for a full sized meal! Looking at the menu I don't think there was anything over $5 in fact. Don't expect crockery though, it's all disposable and food court service. Amazing. A must try cheap eat. "

        "I have to say that this did not rate as my favorite Chinatown. I'm used to Chinatowns where vendors who are eager to make a sale have a large variety of Chinese wares on the streets.  Here, the vendors were friendly enough, but there just wasn't an wide variety of things to buy at this particular Chinatown.  The majority of items for sale included produce, inexpensive clothing items, and faded luggage, though almost everything was well-priced.  If you're hoping to buy some souvenirs with a Chinese influence, you could purchase bamboo plants or windchimes or coin purses, but there weren't a large number of items to choose from.  I, personally, was looking for decorative tassels often found in Asian establishments, teapots, or maybe a place to have my name written in Chinese.  Also, there are a few jewelry stores with nice, high-quality pieces if you don't mind spending the money. Outside of shopping, there are plenty of places to have a meal or have your hair styled.  Again, the posted prices for meals and services were all pretty reasonable.  All in all, it's not a bad place to shop if you're looking for some low-priced items or if you're looking for a nice place to spend the day, but if you're looking for an abundance of Chinese souvenirs, look elsewhere."

Understanding that many people are tourists, he allowed for extra time for taking pictures of some iconic sites in Toronto. The tour was perfectly timed to include a washroom break at the one hour mark. All in all, this tour was helpful to help us see old and new Toronto and learn more about this great city! Thank you to Leandro for being a knowledgeable and fun guide!

Which was fine I enjoyed it just wanted a gentle city walk. We did go into the underground \"paths\" which were quite hot but again all fine. Leonardo made sure he checked people ok with that.

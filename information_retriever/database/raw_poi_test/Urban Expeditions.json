        "My brother and I were visiting Toronto for the first time. There were only two of us doing this tour on the day, so the tour was customized for us. We were brought on a (mostly) walking tour of Toronto, and got to see some of the local neighborhoods, all of which had their distinct character. My favorite part was getting to see the local hang-outs that most tourists wouldn't visit, e.g. the converted quarry and distillery.",

        "My wife and I walking-toured with Urban Expeditions first thing upon our arrival in Toronto. Our guide spent over 4 hrs with us, covered 18,000 steps & gave us a real feel for the layout, life and legacy of the city. Timely usage of a little public transportation helped us enjoy the full gamut of this metropolis which included stunning skyline views, peaceful trail hiking, foods, vibrant neighborhoods and historic sites.  It really helped us for the rest of our stay and activities in Toronto.  I suspect our guide was unequaled in his knowledge, good nature and ability to make us feel connected.  I highly recommend the tour and the people behind it!"

I found the spots were quite spread out with limited time so I only managed to get to about a third.  The spots weren't really geared for the audience (i.e. students) but this would be a great activity for new comers to the city."

This is definitely time well spent and is perfect to do on your first days visiting Toronto so that you can go back and see some of your favorite spots along the tour on your own."

We enjoyed our day with Peter so much and really appreciated all the great insider information he had for us. We could tell he enjoys what he does and has such an appreciation for the area. Highly recommend this tour and Peter.  "

The tour was customized to our interests and the experience was akin to having our very own personal concierge/travel guide…with the feel of hanging out with an cool friend.  Peter was attentive to our needs at every turn…whether we needed a quick break, a snack, etc. he took care of it all.  ",

        "We were able to visit a variety of places and learn about the local culture.  After our time with Peter, we felt a bit more like locals rather than tourists. He was kind enough to follow up and share even more valuable information on the activities we had planned for the next day.",
        "We had an awesome time with Peter and will recommend his services to our friends.  A couple of things to keep in mind is to wear comfortable shoes.  This is a fast paced four hour walk. We covered a lot of ground visiting a variety of places in a short time. Secondly, come with an open mind and an adventurous spirit, Peter will take care of the rest!"

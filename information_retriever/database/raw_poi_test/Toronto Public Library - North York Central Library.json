I like the fish aquariums at the back in the children’s area, although I’m not sure if they’re still there.  ",
        "The on-line reservation system is a painless and convenient way of having books or movies placed on hold for you.  If this library doesn’t have what you’re looking for, another library in the city will.  The hold system will get that book ready for you at the selected branch pick-up location.  ",

        "My only complaint is about the hours.  The Sunday hours are quite limited, and even more so during the summers.  During the summer they’re closed on Sundays.  And during the school year I believe they open at 1:00pm or so.  I find this very unfortunate.  What a better way to keep kids (and adults) occupied in the summer at no cost.  Often times I see several people (mostly youth) sitting outside the closed library with their books, waiting for it to open on Sunday.  The city is getting so much tax revenue from the increase in population, condo property taxes, and so on.  You’d think this could finance longer hours."

        "Yes indeed. If you need way to get close to Toronto's many sources of information without having to go to that central city this smaller library might provide you with an answer. I came across it by walking almost aimlessly down one central street from the subway. I believe it was Yonge Street. This turned out be a wonderful discovery for me because I found this place both comfortable, friendly and welcoming with a good educational value as a place to read stuff that I do not have at home. I did like spending three hours there while my relatives were working elsewhere and I had no money to spend on buying tickets to see various attractions that cost money here. Subway is within walking distance. But most important knowledge was right in front of me. I like to read reviews of music performances and films which I have seen and heard elsewhere. I found several reviews of many performances that I wanted to read just to refresh my memory about my reaction to the events in question. Film reviews and reviews of classical music are important sources of knowledge for me. I compare what others have said or written about the same events. This is how I think. I do like to read foreign language materials especially from newspapers and journals. This library gave me access to this information.  I was not hurried to begin leaving the library after checking out details concerning two books. Instead I was encouraged to sit down and continue reading and researching topics to my delight. Help was available. They did not want to get rid of me. Computer skills were important for me to learn and librarians did help me. I was satisfied with the library. The technological center did put me closer connection through many devices that I did not understand with other sources of information in other places. I was able to compare libraries here with what I was accustomed to back home. Comparisons of this type  should be made for this purpose alone. I was impressed with the library policy not to allow patrons to eat food while using materials in the library. I was also interested to know how the library handles people who come there to sleep or to rest with a dirty slovenly appearance. I imagine that younger children and teenagers will find good reason to use many parts of this library for completing school work. I enjoyed browsing and looking around to find good stuff to read. Listening center was good too. Since this was my first visit I needed time so I took two or three hours to explore the library since I had little else to do then Time well spent for sure. New journals and periodicals were there for my discovery. I did compare collections of books for certain segments of knowledge. I wanted to know if library patrons were any different in their behavior at Canadian public libraries. Decorum might be different in some ways. No real complaints. I wonder what happens to floor space when libraries house e-books more than traditional books on shelves. I wanted to see or count the number of desks for librarians to use while dealing with a patron. I wanted to see the number of librarians were on duty at certain times of the day. Library was crowded or busy with many patrons for a suburban type learning center. In total it was a good experience for me as I did enjoy and profit from being at the North York library. Cross referencing was made easier with technology. Searching for information was also faster with these advances. If you need a place to stay while it is raining or snowing I have a suggestion for you to follow. Go there!"

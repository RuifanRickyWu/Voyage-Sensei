There is also enough bathrooms for the ladies during intermission (always a concern!)  Photos and recording are not allowed during the shows and the audience is requested to either mute or shut off their phones.  This is not abnormal.",

The seats are very comfortable - they offer a student rate and the tickets in general are very well priced. There is a bar with great drinks and wonderful snack for intermission - parking directly across the street and the theatre is well kept and nicely equipped. We will likely see one more play and then consider a subscription which I understand starts at $185 for 9 plays. Highly recommend this place."

The play, though occasionally confusing because of the jumps back and forth in time, is quite fascinating as a riff on Shakespeare's Othello and as a take on the background of Othello's marriage to Desdemona from a black perspective. The performances are  very strong, especially by the actor playing Billie, Virgilia Griffith. Highly recommended."

        "Having been a Tarragon subscriber almost from its inception when i lived a long way out of town, i can recommend Tarragon as a rewarding habit. Now i live much closer and still find it to be a funny mix of the brilliant and the obscure. Almost every season includes at least one sock blaster play - that is one that will blow your socks off and be memorable for decades. Some seasons also bring with them their share of disappointments. In my view, the assessments of the critics writing in the newspapers do not always coincide with my own opinion. I can find myself watching a fine cast working their way purposefully through an indifferent play and read that it has been a must see post-modern triumph. Similarly,  I can find myself reading a scathing report on a play, trashing the cast, berating the author and chastising the set only to find myself transported by a brilliant cast, trenchant direction and an exquisite jewel of a play whose set design complements the play perfectly. I therefore conclude that my judgement must be less refined than that of the critics - but i have to say that i am happy with that. So, get a subscription and take in all of the plays as a theatre should be judge by a season, not a play. Like sports teams, theatres have good seasons and bad seasons and even a poor season at tarragon is good by most small theatre standards. The subscription is flexible, a huge asset in busy Toronto living, and the box office goes to great lengths to get you in when you want to be there and change your reservation if it is possible. There's quite bit of grey hair in the audience; but they look pretty familiar, so it must be habit-forming for them too. The \"deal\" for young people to attend at reduced prices is a great marketing strategy and I see a number of smart young people developing a taste for live theatre through this program. "

Some I have disliked were very well received by other patrons, and presumably vice-versa.  The memorable ones were: \"Little Mercy's First Murder by Morwyn Brebner\", \"The Clockmaker\" by  Stephen Massicotte, and \"East of Berlin\" by  Hannah Moscovitch.  Some plays are clearly experimental, so fall into the \"interesting\" category.  Cases in point for the 2011/12 season were the \"Golden Dragon\" by Roland Schimmelpfennig and \"The small room at the top of the stairs\" by  Carole Fréchette"

That was Courageous by Michael Healey. The Tarragon then didn't present Healey's next play, Proud. ",

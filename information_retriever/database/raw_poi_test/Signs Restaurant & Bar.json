The experience is not only fun but incredibly educational! Our server helped us communicate our orders effectively and laughed with us as we laughed at ourselves mixing up hellos and goodbyes. This is not a one-time visit kind of venue - I already look forward to visiting again! Would recommend for any size of group whether you know ASL or are just curious about the community as there were large parties eating at the tables next to us who looked like they were having just as much of a good time as we were."

I took some sign classes in collage and thought this would be a great opportunity to practice. Unfortunately they decided to close early due to slow business (Father's Day) and so we didn't get a chance to eat there. I \"chatted\" with the bartender a bit and left."

We enjoyed our small peak into the deaf community and our waiter Tristan was great, and so very patient with our attempts at signing.  We started with Beet Bruschetta (okay I admit I thought it said Beef Bruschetta), which I though was okay but my partner loved. I then went with the Venison Sheppards Pie that came with a small side salad - and was perfectly portioned and had an excellent taste. My partner went with the Butternut Squash Ravioli smothered in walnuts and Parmesan with sage on top, and she is still raving about how good it was, best meal she has had in a long time.  We finished up with a chocolate lava cake which was good but not outstanding. ",

The tables also have a mini flip chart with the alphabet and also conversation starters.  ",

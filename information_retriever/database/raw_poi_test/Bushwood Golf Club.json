        "Where do I start. I connected Bushwood golf course about a group of people that wanted to book some tee times together on a Saturday. It would be 12 to 20 people in total from different parts of Ontario. We Golf together once a month and we do a poll on which course we will play. Bushwood was at the top with two other courses. So I sent off an email to Bushwood explaining what it is we do and here was there reply to me \"Unfortunately, we only run small tournaments and events during the week, not the weekend.\" CHIT you not. I was not asking them to shut down the course for us or even give us food. Just a bunch of people of different ages that like to golf together."

She clearly doesn’t care except for taking your money for a crappy boring course . Ignorant approach . Her own staff mouth her . What does that say ?? The course is in horrible condition . Long fairway grass leaves every where and swamp every where . Overpriced and run by a tyrant"

The club house is rather basic, but the beer on the 19th hole was cold and they patio had a great view, we had a great time, will be returning to golf again."

Morning was less crowded and with a warm sun on our back and pleasant wind blowing, it was a near perfect day to spend at the Golf Course. The driving range, putting green and the 9 hole executive course was not difficult to maneuver and was ideal for beginners.  The club house was well decorated with memorabilia and gifts were reasonably priced. The bar was sparse and can definitely be improved. A place not far from the city and recommended for golf enthusiasts."

There is a driving range, practice putting green and a nice old clubhouse with good food. The courses are typically well maintained with lots of mature trees and water hazards. The course record was set by Bubba Watson with a round of 61. Bubba married a local Canadian gal and happened to show up for a round. Mary Evelyn is the owner, seems to be on top of her staff and runs a tight ship-she can be testy if you don't follow all the rules so don't let your game run into the late twilight hours."

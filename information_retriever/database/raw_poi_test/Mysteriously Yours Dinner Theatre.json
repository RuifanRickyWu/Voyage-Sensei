        "DEFINITELY NOT worth the 280$ I paid. The food was disgusting hotel buffet- with how much they make, they’re better off hiring caterers with real food. The show was pretty good, I expected better, but the jokes made up for awful written script.  I couldn’t enjoy my evening however because all I kept thinking was “for that price I could have had a steak dinner, and still come to the show after. They should rename it “Buffet and a Show”."

        "I have never been to the old stand alone location so I can't comment on previous negative reviews in relation. We attended the last showing of \"No Time to Kill\" at the Chelsea Hotel on Saturday, April 10, 2019 with a group of 10. The table was perfect since each table fits exactly 10 people. ",
        "The night was a surprise birthday for my boyfriend and I personally loved that this was in the hotel which added to the surprise element for him. Our table was on the edge of the room which didn't cause any issue since the actors walk around engaging everyone in the room. I loved that they never broke characters and would ask questions to get us guessing on clues who was the murderer. ",
        "The food was good- a lot of people complain about the food choices, but at the end of the day we weren't there for food. Personally, I love anything cards and that's exactly what was delivered. No one else at the table complained about the food and we all went for seconds or thirds. ",
        "The time absolutely flew by as we mingled and wrote out clues on the note pads. We didn't have a hard time of hearings the actors have conversations at other tables, and if we did , the actors eventually came by our tables and we could ask more questions. I loved that they were able to incorporate my boyfriend into the skit numerous times making him feel even more a part of the night. They also called out numerous people at all tables so everyone gets their moment to \"shine\" in the skit. ",
        "At the end, everyone who was there for their birthday got to stand up and receive applause which always makes the night special. ",

The evening starts with a three course meal  and after the meal the mystery begins with a murder.   The actors are within the crowd and interact with the crowd as the mystery is solved.  If you are celebrating a birthday or anniversary you can call ahead and be involved in the show. At the end of the show crowd can guess the murderer.  Lots of fun and laughs for a very enjoyable evening."

        "My spouse and I travelled to Toronto from Ottawa for New Year's Eve. We had reserved (two weeks earlier) spots for the dinner theatre.  We were seated with four other persons we didn't know (two couples) and had an absolutely grand time of it.  The positives: the food was a mix of very good and excellent.  The Mushroom and Chestnut soup was wonderful - rich, creamy, nutty and served piping hot.  The beef tenderloin was exquisite, melt in your mouth.  The mashed potatoes were a bit dry.  The chicken and pasta was tasty and moist - probably rate it a 4 out of 5.  For dessert I had the toffee pudding and found it delicious.  A foodie might suggest a drizzle of rum over the pudding would have turned it from a 4/5 to a 5/5 dish.  My wife had the smores tart, which was way too sweet for anyone over the age of 6 I'd say.  The pastry was dry and the filling seemed not so fresh - in my view the pudding was the much better dessert.  The alcoholic cocktails the bar had come up with for the evening were excellent and ran the gamut from very sweet to dry to non-alcoholic.  The service was very good - as attentive as they could be given the number of clients.  The actors were spot on, delivering their lines with gusto and excellent timing.  They engaged the audience skillfully, keeping people in their place with wit and well worded directions.  The play was engaging, humourous and made for wonderful entertainment. Highly recommend this as a night out!  That said - a few points to note - double check the day before or day of that your reservations have been properly recorded, especially if you book online as you pay up front.  When we arrived we were not on the seating plan.  Luckily we had brought a printout of our reservation and payment receipt so they seated us right away and there was no issue.  The dance stage is very small too - so as long as you don't mind dancing as though you're in a mosh pit it's fine, but don't expect to be able to swing dance or do any crazy couple routines. Lastly, the only thing that really disappointed was the champagne that was served at midnight.  It tasted like Kool Aid put through a soda stream machine - it was awful, no other word for it. But by then I wasn't feeling much pain anyway  and the rest of the night had been so great that a little bit of bad sparkling wine posed no danger of ruining the night out. All in all a great time!"

        "I didn't know what to expect when my wife and I arrived for a Friday night performance of \"Murder by the Books\". You can almost miss the entrance on the west side of Yonge St. Sure, there's a sign and a door squeezed in between, what?, a waxing clinic and medical research office. Where's the theatre? The mystery deepened as we descended a flight of stairs to the reception desk. Down? As the cheery receptionist took our tickets she directed us to the coat check ($2) and requested we fill-out a name tag. As we rounded the corner we found ourselves on a balcony looking down on a large theatre, below street level. I immediately had a flashback to a Harry Potter movie (I don't know, Harry Potter and the Theatre of Mysteries, perhaps) in which they crawl into a small tent only to find themselves in a spacious interior. OK - was this a speakeasy in the 20's (the Roaring 20's - 1920's for the younger crowd - not that I REMEMBER them)? No, the building is too new. Who builds something like this on Yonge street? A mystery. We found our booth, identified by a sign, near the bottom of the stairs at the back of the theatre by the entrance to the kitchen. A good spot for us. Lot's of comings and goings to keep our short attention spans busy. (Really. \"Oh look, that's what we ordered\", \"what's that?\", \"I didn't know they served cocktails\", etc.)  The server was pleasant, informative (they weren't full tonight, but the night before they had a wedding party), accommodating (extra dill sauce for the salmon) and mostly prompt - the wine (Henkel $30+) took 1 or 2 minutes longer to arrive than I thought it should. Maybe I was impatient. I ordered the Chicken Paprikash a la Harry and my wife, surprise, Agatha's Roasted Salmon. Both salmon and chicken were moist and cooked (my wife's beef (so to speak) about seafood). Moderate portions. Tasty. Desserts just ok and not large. The show was fun. The actors visit every table before the start. The small stage is used only briefly. Otherwise the show takes place throughout the theatre. There is a definitive clue as to who the killer is. I missed it. I could blame it on the bottle of wine and two Grand Marniers but it's more likely I went not to solve a mystery but simply to enjoy the dinner and show."

The decor was reflective of the theme of the theatre.  Bathroom was clean.   The only down side is that it is not accessible which is unfortunate.

        "We have been several times and have always enjoyed the food and entertainment.  We had a large table so every item of food ended up getting ordered.  Every item was quite good.  The production had many laughs and was quite well done.  It is a good venue to bring a bunch of friends for an evening out.  Plus the price is quite modest for the quality of food and entertainment."

Even chose one of their shows for my birthday celebration and reluctantly (JK...you don't have to. They ask if you are celebrating anything and you can chose to be acknowledged, or not) participated in the show. Love the guess work of the whodunnit and always a fun night out."

        "This was quite a unique experience for our staff outing.  This business provides a very tasteful meal with something for everyone.  The meal service was prompt and mindful of dietary restrictions.  The chef delivered excellent portions with tremendous flavor and superb presentation.  The entertainment was well done and very interactive.  This was an anniversary event for our staff but unfortunately it was not integrated into the show as we had hoped it would be, so if you are celebrating anything, despite what you may be told, don't expect your event to become part of the show.  The improv is good and actors were hilarious at times making the show a non-stop work of mystery and intrigue.   We certainly recommend this show and would return again. "

        "I took my husband and 2 teenagers to the dinner theatre as a surprise to celebrate my husband's birthday.  We also ate dinner there prior to the show.  The food itself was pretty good - certainly not fancy but it tasted homemade and was fairly tasty.  They provided some gluten-free options, which was important to me.  The show itself was very entertaining.  The actors did a fabulous job working with the material that the audience gave them.  They were all so great at thinking on their feet.  The theme of the show was characters in the 80's - the references and jokes were great and although lots of them were lost on my teenaged kids, they enjoyed the show and found the actors very amusing.  A fun night out!"

        "I attended New Years Eve and for $175 per person, i at least expected a decent meal.  We had a table reserved for 6 people.  3 of us had the crusted bassa (cheapest fish you can buy) and the other 3 had the chicken supreme.  The fish was awful, it was served cold and the crust was overwhelming, way too much of it.  The chicken supreme, looked more like a chicken wing with mashed potatoes.  Was not worth the money at all.  Very disappointed - they should have made more of an effort.  Store bought costco cookies for dessert - really? Bread was cold. ",
        "I attended for a corporate event in December and paid $60 a person and the food was better.  I had the salmon and it was quite good.  Would not recommend for New Years not worth the money. ",

Chocolate bread pudding was bland and tasteless too. service was absolutely terrible! Our food was brought in so late that many people were finishing dessert when we finally got the appetizers. They ran out of salad! So we were forced to choose a soup instead. The waiter never apologized for the delay. ",

The track was fun, the karts and helmets were clean with good upkeep. Karts we’re fast with clean handling. You should always call ahead or reserve a spot because it gets VERY busy at times. Don’t come in with a party of children, without calling or reserving because you will have to wait a long time because as i mentioned before, it gets busy. The staff was welcoming and accommodating and helped us right away. They even gave driving tips. some people writing reviews here are inconsiderate  because they caused the reason to their unpleasant experience."

        "My boyfriend and I were excited to race at K1 as we hadn’t been. Unfortunately during our (shorter than promised) 12-Lap race, we noticed that certain “regulars” (we noticed them chatting with K1 staff before and after the race), would signal to the staff DURING the race, and their cars would suddenly become faster. Even if you had your foot on the gas at 100%, it was obvious that the output of our cars was significantly different than the ones passing us without hesitation. We’re not competitive people, but for almost $200.00 for 2, 12-lap races, we were expecting it to at least be fair."

        "Worst experience.  I spent over to hours in the facility for the 5 kids I brought to spend 10 minutes doing 2 x 12 laps.  There was a close to hour wait between the first 12 lap course and the second 12 lap course.  No need for that.  Staff was horrible.  No one acknowledged me when I came in.  I had to interrupt someone to ask what the process was.  Even after registering the 5 kids no one explained anything to me.   This was my first time here.   Booked a time to be there for what I thought was the start time however that is the time for when you can register and then have to wait 40 minutes for the first 12 lap course.  Staff also told me when I was registering that I should just write that I was a walk in.  So what's the point of registering on line.  What is the point of the 9 dollar registration fee.  It cost me $59 per kid for 10 mins of activity.  The second 12 lap course was also cut short so definitely wasn't worth the money.  You can't  pay me enough money to come back to this place!  I wouldn't even come back if it was free!"

Also, if there are experienced drivers on the track with the ppl ur with, u r expected to slow down, get out of their way and ruin your time so they can get a better track time. In theory it kind makes sense, but when ur new and zipping along, u dont have mirrors so u dont know if the car behind wants to pass on the left or the right and because you're new, it's hard to react that quickly when ur barely holding on without crashing yourself.

We got there right at opening, we were immediately greeted with wonderful staff. They set us up and we were on our way within minutes. Before we started I took a quick walk around the facility which was very tidy, well set up and impressively decorated with race car body panels. Then came the karting. The karts were quick, responsive and clearly well maintained.  After two laps the staff decided we were capable of handling the karts at speed and turned the power up to what I would imagine was near the top of their capabilities. What I found probably the most impressive was the live timing printouts they provided at no cost! I’m sure I could go on for a full paragraph more, but to keep it short, it was the best karting experience I’ve had so far and would HIGHLY recommend K1 Toronto to any karting enthusiast or even those looking for a good time!"

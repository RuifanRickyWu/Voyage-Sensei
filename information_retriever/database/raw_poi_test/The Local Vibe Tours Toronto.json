        "Our family and adult children spent the afternoon with Danny yesterday doing a Scarborogh Food Tour. We were looking for something different as we live in central toronto and wanted to have a food experience that was not curated only for tourists. This Tour fit the bill perfectly. Danny is a great culture and food ambassadoror for Scarborough. He curated the tasting Tour to lull us into a warm savoury  taste hug . We visited multiple venues by car and were supplied with water and detailed information about the cultures and businesses. There were a lot of pleasant surprises along the way. It is amazing to experience the hospitality of the small business owners. We even went back to one of the spots today to pick up more of the amazing food we sampled yesterday. It was the perfect holiday outing that we will will be able to come back to over and over again. What a great day. Thank you Danny!"

He was very professional and courteous and had answers to all our questions.  My favourite was the Sri Lankan Kothu Roti with Mutton, so delicious! The Lebanese Dessert place was amazing as well.  It would be very hard to find a lot of these places without asking someone who lives in Scarborough.  Definitely off the beaten path with little hole in the wall places that serve honest tasty food! Definitely a must do while you are in Toronto if you willing to explore some food you may have never tried before.  Thanks again Dan! "

Danny, our guide and expert, took us to some local restaurants that we either hadn't heard of or we've driven/walked by but never thought to actually try. Each restaurant had its own unique offering and cuisine but they all had two things in common - great people and amazing food! As vegans, it can sometimes be difficult to find suitable options but Danny had us covered. He ensured that each restaurant prepared something special for our needs. When the tour ended at a yummy chocolatier (which wasn't vegan), Danny pulled out special locally-made coconut macaroons so that we weren't left out of a sweet treat! It was so thoughtful! As we walked from restaurant to restaurant, Danny shared fun facts and stories about the neighborhood and its origin. I highly recommend this experience for anyone looking to enjoy a local vibe and amazing food. Thanks Danny!!!"

        "The music the Toronto Symphony Orchestra performed when I came here was so moving and performed very well. The night I was here, the two main highlights were Tchaikovsky’s Variations on a Theme by Rococo (with Jean-Guihen Queyras as the cello soloist) and Ravel’s Daphnis et Chloé Suite No. 2. My only complaint, however, is that the acoustics are not the best in here. Compared to other halls I’ve been to such as Koerner Hall, the sound just does not project and travel as well in here. The hall is also not as resonant. Regardless of that inconvenience, that did not take away from the overall uplifting mood the concert gave me once I left the hall. Although I do not live in Toronto, I left feeling like it would be worth coming to another TSO concert when in the area.",

As usual things such as a bottle of water are over priced at just over 3.00a bottle and you cannot bring any in with you so why not traet yourself.  The staff are very helpful and most of them seem friendly.  I would lile.to make sure that you know you know if you have a fear of heights order in advamce and get floor seats it can be scary getting to the balcony seats if you have this fear.  The only thing I did not like was took for every to get out of the hall after the show only some od the exits were open creating a long backlog and wait.  It really made me nervous as I had thougjt what if there was an emergency.  I feel they shouldlet people know what to do and what they would dp to help us exit.  It gave me a really uneasy feeling when exiting at how long it took and in fact that there does not seem to be any automated system to open the doors in such a case.  If there was an evac sign posted I would have felt much better.  But had a great time and the prices are good.  I just wish resellers did not buy up all the best seats and sell them at 5 times the price.  They need to fix that to make it fare. "

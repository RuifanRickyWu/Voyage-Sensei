It was wonderful spending time together, learning a new skill, and we got so much value out of the experience (recipe, learning, and bringing our croissants home). David was wonderful, knowledgeable and patient. My mom has a long-standing shoulder injury and so rolling out the dough was tough for her - David was understanding and made sure to help her as often as he could. I brought the croissants to a friend's next morning to pop in the oven for brunch and they were such a hit. I don't think I'll ever make them again (they're a ton of work) but that doesn't change how I feel about the overall experience. I would love to try the ravioli class David mentioned."

The teacher was knowledgeable about chocolate and answered all our questions. Gave us lots of room to just create. What was really surprising was the amount of chocolate we were taking home at the end of the experience. A lot of sharing at home after! We highly recommend! Also, they told us that they do birthday parties for children at home so we want to look into that as well."

You get 12 pre-made little truffles (that you later fill yourself), two flavours of ganache, a square of caramel, a dixie cup of chocolate and toppings to finish off your treats. It was neat putting everything together, but our instructor wasn't the most engaging nor the most informative, which made her seem inexperienced and the whole thing kind of amateurish. It would probably be a lot of fun with a large group of friends or co-workers, but for almost $150 for two people, I expected a lot more. Would not do this again."

However, horrible horrible staff (few in particular) that feels it necessary to harass their customers over policies that are not clearly outlined anywhere in their facility (put up signs as there were none). The staff made assumptions that I verbally abused their member which is completely false and unprecedented...anything to get your customers out the door right? Especially when a staff member makes it their mission to ruin your night. The security guards are time wasters, and pathetic. A miniscule situation that could have been handled differently had their female waitress approached us without aggression and did not speak to us in such a condecending tone.This company needs to educate their staff on how to properly speak to customers. They did not give us a chance to correct the misunderstanding, but rather asks you to leave on the first \"offense\".Absolutely disgusted at how we were treated here. Don't come to this location if you want to have their staff completely ruin your experience of the show."

        "We took in Second City’s Unconventional Holiday Revue on January 1st and can't imagine a better way to start 2020. The show was smart, funny, touching, funny, unpredictable and did I mention funny. The majority of the material was made up of rehearsed sketches, some of which had interjections of audience suggestions, and were so well done that you were easily able to forget about your hangover from partying the night before. ",
        "There were two moments that allowed you to truly appreciate how amazing, talented and patient these performers are. The first was a sketch where one of the actresses picked a female volunteer from the audience to whom she was going to make a big reveal to about her life. The actress peppered the audience member with some questions and then launched into it. We were treated to a funny, honest and touching performance by both people that couldn't help but bring a tear to your eye. The second sketch was based on Dickens \"A Christmas Carol\" and for it the performers had the unfortunate happenstance to pick a drunk, melodramatic, ham of a person who couldn't do more to derail the work of the performers on stage. They did there best to work around him and I admire their patience but he was so disruptive there was just no saving the piece. Thankfully this wasn't the last of the evening and they rallied and gave us some great laughs to finish out the night. ",

        "This year there were three good Italian bands and singers that we really enjoyed. They are spread out so that you can walk to which ever one is playing. The only Italian food is at the 3 or 4 Italian restaurants. Only Cafe Diplomatico opens before 1 pm on Sunday and so there are line ups. If you sit on the extended patio you need to pay with cash. Menu is limited but the food is good, but not great. I ordered mussels in red sauce and the waiter kept insisting that the white sauce was better. Thinking that maybe there had been complaints I said ok to the white sauce. It was so spicy hot I didn't eat it and I am used to eating hot food. There were at least two jalepenos sliced into the broth that completely overpowered the delicate mussels. Without the broth or something to dip the bread into, it wasn't much of a lunch.  I noticed that Cafe Diplomatico had street food vendors out the front with things like speducci skewers that were not on the sit down menu. There is little space to sit if you get street food from anywhere. They should have cannolis and biscotti instead of churros, and pasta and meatballs instead of butter chicken. See some Brio instead of juice based drinks",
        "It's worth a short visit and maybe better at night. There are other non Italian places to eat but that sort of defeats the purpose."

You can tell the vibe here from the organizers and the venders is money money money. No free anything being offered. You would of thought the committee that gets together to put this on would be giving away pasta and cheap Italian foods. Pasta by the bag is less than a buck and so is the sauce. Overall I would rate my experience",

The focal point of Little Italy is College Street - it‚Äôs a pleasant 20-minute stroll through the neighbourhood, and although purists might argue there are numerous other cuisines and cultural influences present, we felt it was definitely worth a visit to sample a taste of Italy üá≠üá∫.

Maybe we went on the wrong weekend? Maybe we missed what street any vendors or shops were on? But besides getting to walk with my spouse, this part of the trip felt like a bust."

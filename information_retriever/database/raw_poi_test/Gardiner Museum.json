I relished its fine array of 18th Century Meissen Porcelain Creations many of them modelled by Johan Kaendler such as;\"Monkey Orchestra\",\"Pair of Pug Dogs\"(from Royal Palace of Warsaw).I also appreciated \"Young Sultan and Sultana Dressed For Masquerade Ball(Hochst),\"Cat and Mouse(produced in St. Cloud,France produced in the 18th Century)and \"Bottle Vase With Scarab Beetle in Japanese Style(Minton ),and \"Andromeda\".,among others.",
        "  I also saw its tip top collection of Majolica  Creations such as \"Dish With 2 Lovers\",Deruta),\"Dish From Story of Tyreus and Polynice,1522\",Francisco X. Avelli's\"Jug With Anthromorphic Beast\",and \"Scene With Christ and Doubting Thomas\",among others..Most of the works on display were produced by Italian Artisans in the 16th Century Italian Cities such as;Deruta,Faenz,and Urbino.",
        "  At this Ceramic Museum,I also liked the Modern Creations of Jun Kaneko(\"Hizen Dish With Landscape,Japan\"),Jean Pierre LaRocque(\"Horse With Baggage\"),and Shary Boyle(\"Cracked Wheat\").There was a plethora  information,so that you could understand these splendid ceramic and porcelain creations better.I enjoyed my foray into the study of Ceramic Art."

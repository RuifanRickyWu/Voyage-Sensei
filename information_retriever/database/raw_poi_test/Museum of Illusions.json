Thrilled yet bewildered you will enter a world that will blow your mind but also give you an opportunity to learn all sorts of things... come and visit us! It is sure to be an amazing and unimaginable experience because whatever you see, especially here in the Museum of Illusions, is not what it appears to be. Are you ready for an adventure?",

        "We spent a delightful 90 minutes exploring the Museum of Illusions on Front St. in Toronto. We booked tickets for 10 am on Sunday, few people were present besides us. Our grandkids were 3, 7, 9 and 10 years, boys and girls and they ran giddily from exhibit to exhibit exploring the illusions and trying to figure out how they worked and why. The small space mandates timed entry but there were plenty of illusions to keep everyone mesmerized and not feel crowded. Optical illusions are well placed and ingeniously designed, like the transit car and the \"chair\" in the middle of the hall. Mirrors and optical illusions created a variety of visual treats including kaleidoscopes, games, vertigo-inducing tunnels and objects that appeared different in size but were in fact similar. Our kids were the perfect age to appreciate the interactive activities of the museum, even the 3 year old. Apparently, attendance is heavy in the summer, but very sparse in the winter, so pick your season and select an early morning time slot to have the run of the museum. Coat check and toilet facilities are available."

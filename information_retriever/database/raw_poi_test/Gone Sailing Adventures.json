  "description": "Gone Sailing Adventures was founded in 2008 by Howie Colt and started charters in 2010. His passion for sailing and over forty-five years of experience has developed into a desire to introduce more people into the world of yachting. Starting as a cruising instructor, Cap't Howie has grown the company to provide the widest range of sailing options in the Greater Toronto Area. Gone Sailing Adventures' fleet includes 10 luxury yachts - 1 catamaran, 5 sailing & 3 motor. All our yachts exceed Transport Canada minimum safety requirements and include a licensed captain and host. Each boat is a brilliant example of modern ship engineering and boasts a superior interior finish. On our larger yachts, there is both covered (bimini) and open areas for those who cannot decide whether they want sun or shade. Foul weather covers are provided should the sunshine be in its liquid form. Below decks are a full galley, seating and head (washroom).",

        "I was looking for a convenient and cost-effective way to reconnect with my love for sailing after many years away.  Gone Sailing Adventures was the PERFECT solution!  Over the course of 4 seasons I worked my way through the SailCanada curriculum taught by Captain Howie and his team, and worked my way up from the Catalina 275 Sport my first season to three seasons on the luxurious Dufour 380.  Gone Sailing Adventures was my one stop shop to make my sailing dreams a reality.  I loved the convenience of the marina being close to work and in the heart of the city.  It made weekday sunset sails with colleagues easy and fun.  And it was just as easy to take out friends on the weekend with the convenient access to Humber Bay and the Toronto Islands, and parking near the marina.  The boats were well maintained and always ready for \"step on\" sailing.  Captain Howie and his team are also available for private lessons, clinics, and special occasion charters.  I hired a \"captain for a day\" a few times to help me build skills or just help out with the sailing so I could enjoy more time with my guests.  This year my wife and I bought our own boat and look forward to cruising the Great Lakes and beyond.  Our dreams are coming true thanks to Gone Sailing Adventures!  Thank you Captain Howie and team for making it all possible!"

        "A highly recommended place to be. In 2020, there was practically no sailclub in Toronto to provide any sailing activity due to the pandemic. Gonesailing managed to fill this gap. I took with them a small keelboat course with Captain Howie Colt. In 2021, they had a nice program for new sailors like me with no experience. This program helped me to develop my skills in the water. This was one of the nicest programs offered by Gonesailing out of many others. Not to mention that this program allowed you to Sail 4 times a week, therefore a total of 50+ sailing during the season. No club as far as I know offer this, not in Toronto, nor outside Toronto. About its cost, I cannot put it here as it was extremely cheap 😊.  Gonesailing is more than an education sailing club. They will make sure you sail as a pro in moderate to strong weather. I believe, I would have spent lots of time and money if I have to do it myself.  Today, I reach small keelboat sailor and thanks to Gonesailing team as well. Waiting impatiently next season to upgrade my skills from small boat to large boat. If you visit Gonesailing, dont forget to ask for Nicolas. He is always smiling. He will help you in all ways to make your venture memorable. Their location is just perfect. It is in core harbourfront, close to TTC and many hotspots to visit in Toronto which included CN Tower, ScotiaArena, Music Garden, and many more.Thank you Gonesailing."

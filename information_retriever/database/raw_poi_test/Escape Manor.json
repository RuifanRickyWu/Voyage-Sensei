Would recommend for something to do with family that is a lot more fun than going to the movies! Only downside is that it is very expensive when bringing a family. The pricing for escape rooms has gone through the roof and it isn‚Äôt very logical. If anything, it cost them less to have more people in the room because they complete it faster, and therefore have more time to reset for the next group."

        "My review is solely for the Escape room experience at Escape Manor. I was not impressed. My group and I have done over¬†100 escape rooms, and this experience ranks very low on our list. First, $29 for a 45 minute room is steep. There are so many other escape rooms in Toronto that offer a full 60 minutes for the same price, or even less. Also, the Ottawa Escape Manor rooms are $23. I didn't find anything special about the Toronto rooms, why the extra $6? Second, the whole experience just felt really rushed. I felt like I was in an escape room mill. Our host and game master kept yelling at us to hurry, and they delivered the room backstory to us all in one breath. I get that some of it was probably for effect, to get us hyped up for the room, but we received the same hurried treatment after the room. I am paying for the whole experience, not just the 45 minutes in the room. Third, the game masters we had need some coaching on how to give clues. We asked for a clue over the walkie talkie about one puzzle and when they asked us what combination we had, their response was, \"ok, wait a second, let me check my notes\"...and \"nope, you're wrong,\" and then we were promptly ignored. Of course we know we are wrong, that is why we are asking for a clue. I had to ask them to help us more, and they didn't seem to know how,¬†they just kept asking us what other combinations we've tried. This was wasting a lot¬†of time,¬†and my team actually figured it out on our own without a clue. Now, the actual room itself was quite fun. It was well built, with cool props, and quite immersive. Some of the puzzles were a bit tricky, but all solvable. However, for the price and the lackluster experience with the staff, I don't recommend doing the¬†escape rooms here. Plenty of other great places for escape rooms in Toronto."

        "The Wine Cellar was our group‚Äôs consensus favourite. The stakes are just as high in this scenario with an added gruesome twist. My wife loved that she could actually bring her wine into the room (all rooms are licensed).  I felt they did a great job in non-linear puzzle design. ",
        "Escape Manor pays attention to detail, and that is most evident in their staff. All our hosts were fantastic; the bar staff too; and managers Bria, Meghan, and Dave each took time to chat with me and make me feel welcome."

Having done a few escape rooms, i like the concept of locking your belongings like purse, cell phone in a locker.  Opposed to just hanging your jacket up in an armoire. ",
        " After a review of the rules and a quick introduction it‚Äôs then on to the game itself.  We did the Asylum room, which allows for 2 to 8 people. We were a bit skeptic, since the room accommodates 8 and there were only 2 of us. It was very difficult to complete within 45 min. The room was done well, good size to accommodate larger groups, the props and overall room was great. I was disappointed and hoped we had more time, for 2 people an hour and half would be ideal. We had asked if there was another booking after us in order to extend our time which would have been more satisfying. But unfortunately, we were not able to, even though the place was completely empty when we were leaving.  Great room for 4 or more players. Definately would not recommend if your group is less it's just not satisfying. "

Escape Manor has not honoured a 2-for-1 code I used via Toronto's winter promo. When I first paid on the Escape Manor website, the website told me I had paid in full for 2 people and Escape Manor would refund me the admission of one person. In fact, the confirmation email said \"If you have a pre-purchased ticket code or promo code, it will be redeemed upon check-in at the Manor.\"",
        "However, when I got to Escape Manor, no one mentioned a refund. I later had to approach staff, who then told me that it would take approximately TWO WEEKS to give me the refund! The apologetic and embarrassed staff members said the owners know the discount code doesn't work online, but they haven't fixed it, so a staff member has been tasked to manually refund all people using this code.",
        "So of course, now I have to add to my massive daily \"to do\" list a note to periodically check if Escape Manor has given me a refund. If they don't, it's off to my credit card company to complain within the allotted timeframe.",
        "It's a ridiculous situation that Escape Manor could easily fix, if they cared. For example, Mysterious Minds (a really fun escape room in Toronto) only puts a hold on your credit card, and does not charge people until they show up in person just before the start of the game. At the very least, Escape Manor should be emailing people to reassure them of a refund instead of passively waiting for customers to ask frontline staff for an explanation.",
        "Part of the experience of an escape room is great customer service. And the residue of: (a) feeling tricked; (b) feeling temporarily or permanently ripped off; (c) feeling like the business does not care (e.g. no email from the company on this issue); and (d) being an unwilling participant in giving Escape Manor an interest-free loan, is not a feeling that would make me want to return."

We ended up paying $1/minute in the room because of this. If you have 10 people better off booking for 5 and just adding people to the one room if they show up. Otherwise, a fun experience and well designed escape room."

        "In my opinion, this is the best escape room location I've been to in Toronto - the rooms are challenging, the storylines have just the right amount of spooky, and there are lots of options to choose from! In addition to the excellent downtown location, the bar is a great area that you're happy to spend an hour or so hanging out in either before or after an activity. I've also tried the axe-throwing upstairs as part of a fun and unique bachelorette party I attended, and everyone involved had a great time. The staff at Escape Manor have always been terrific. Friendly and very helpful, ensuring guests get the most out of their experience! Highly recommend"

        "Escape Manor has a beautiful bar area where you can grab a refreshment before your escape experience, or to debrief with your team after! We were playing Death Row, which had some really fun elements to it, with a generous mix of both logical and physical puzzles.  The only element we didn't like (but it is personal preference!) was a decryption puzzle which we felt was a little large given the number of puzzles and time given, however do not be discouraged as the room as a package was very good with great production value also.  We failed to get out, eventually completing all activities approx one minute post the 45 minute deadline.  We would recommend this game, and shall certainly return to Escape Manor on a future trip back to Toronto."

She was informative, fun and safety minded- which really matters when throwing axes! Their waitstaff were attentive and the food  and vibe in the bar/ lounge was VERY good ! Nice vegetarian options too. We didn‚Äôt manage an escape room but I‚Äôve heard they are excellent- will definitely be going back here:)"

        "We had selected the Asylum: The look of the room seemed a little unfinished but it was serviceable. The following experience ruined the room. Basically with 10 minutes left and several of us trying to open the lock as instructed, we asked for assistance. When a staff member came in, he attempted to open the lock and failed to do so (while killing the time on our clock) even though he had performed the same methods and tasks we had. We were unable to continue to the rest of the room because this lock was a major component to our escape. ",
        "We were let down not because we did not escape, but because the room was rigged for us to fail. The staff member tried to justify saying that others in the past other groups have been able to open the lock, but it seemed dismissive of how our experience was ruined. Especially since he was unable to open the lock. The staff member tried to appease our disappointment by giving us a 20% discount to our next booking. I felt was not the appropriate course of action. After all, why would I be incentivized to make a new booking if one of your basic components to solving the puzzle did not even function properly? The experience was so empty that we weren't even offered to take pictures as a group. After our Escape room, we had a drink to enjoy the lounge at least, though  I am unlikely to recommend this venue for their Escape rooms in the future."

        "I have been going to this pub for 4-5 years. One of my favourite dishes was the Chili. Before the take over it came covered in cheese with thick slices of bread. Last Saturday it was a mushy mess in a flat soup bowl with a sprinkling of melted cheese in the middle. The bread was 2 slices of char broiled diet crisp bread, probably 21/2” X 11/2”. They have absolutely destroyed this wonderful dish and raised the price. A 2 star night."

        "Not a beer or ale drinker so can only comment on wine which was average. The big con was the food --- had roast beef special. Reminded me of homecooked Sunday dinners from long ago. However, the food on the entire plate was cool. Not warm even, but cool. Same for my friend's -- her fries were only partially cooked. For this reason my review dropped from what could have easily been a 5 to a 3. Nice staff but too few serving  on a busy evening which could explain why the food came out late and  was sub par. "

        "I've been there several times to meet friends. Its a very friendly social place. It's an older crowd, live music on Saturday night, great scotch selection, lots of talking so its a little loud at times. They have a good menu but the food is below par. The wait staff work hard to get the food out. The last 3 meals I've had were either cold or bland or weird. The Greek style mussels were cold and the broth was clearish and sickly sweet. My friend could not even eat their homestyle mac and cheese. As I said this is not the first time I've wasted my money so I feel I gave them a chance. Go for a drink and a good time be warned about the food"

The roast dinner was quite good- vegetables were cooked perfect, beef tasted good, good gravy.... The mash was a bit lumpy and the Yorkshires were a bit over cooked. I had the vegetable korma. Not so good. I could have made this dish at home with a can of chickpeas, canned tomatoes and a bit of curry. It was very bland."

Good proper pub food and the more North American pub food as well.  Dart players, lots of red and that crazy designed carpet that still doesn't seem to go away in England.  A good local and if you're into whiskey, they have one of the best whiskey selections in North America."

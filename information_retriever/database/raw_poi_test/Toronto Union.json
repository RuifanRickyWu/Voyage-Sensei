        "Hi Folks ",
        "We came to Toronto for the first time on a little vacation to get away from PEI. We wanted to see Toronto and it‚Äôs Culture. Especially taste it‚Äôs diverse food. Which means we have to travel. We stayed in the Ice Towers downtown. We had to use some sort of transit to get around to explore the City. We talked to many locals and the most advice we were given was to avoid the underground PATH network. Locals have a hard time with it, and get lost. I looked at the map. And yes. Not a chance I would make it through. Now, we did use the path a bit to keep out of the rain but we did not go in deep. I think it would of been fine to use but the signage was not good. I think they should have lines on the floor or the wall that someone could follow along to get to various exits or businesses. It would be so simple at the time of development to do this. ",
        "We were told the best way to get around is the subway system. So we did. And we did very well getting off and on at various stops at intersections. It was Union Station that completely mind boggled us! Advice? Find the fantastic information person wearing the read hooded poncho with the big white ‚Äúi‚Äù on the front. If it wasn‚Äôt for these fantastic most likely underpaid employees we never would of made it through. If we were in Maritimes and we looked lost, we wouldn‚Äôt have to ask for help. People see people in our neck of the woods. If someone seemed like they were having trouble, they would be approached and helped. I think this is what shocked me the most about city life. It seemed odd to me that there could be so many people and yet everyone seemed so alone. Like everyone was invisible to each other. No one holding doors open for the next person. And if you did, people walk through like you didn‚Äôt. Head phones and cell phones, I felt like I was in the movie Wally. Everyone was programmed. I guess for people who live in a city it is something you get used to after while. Sorry, went off on a ‚ÄúSquirrel‚Äù moment. So yes. We really appreciated the information people. You do fantastic work. Today we will be tipping these people when we hit the subway. I hope others do as well. ",
        "We are going to keep getting lost and hopefully gain more knowledge. Coming for a couples getaway, it definitely sucks the love life out of ya!! You need to be patient and expect to get lost, don‚Äôt be on a tight schedule, you need plenty of time. If you are alone, don‚Äôt think going with another person will help. It wont. You will just be twice as lost lol. And ask for help. Most people are nice and will point you in the right direction when approached. ",
        "Well gonna give it another go....... another day in Toronto. I think I can now make it on to the subway. I know I will still get lost coming off. I mean..... it‚Äôs only my third time. ü§£"

        "One thing that was glaringly omitted from the plan was any thought to how passengers are dropped off and picked up when traveling to and from Union Station. At the main entrance, along Front Street, there is a taxi stand running west and space for emergency vehicles running east. When private vehicles stop to pick up or drop off passengers in the taxi stand zone (which happens), the taxi drivers honk and get exasperated. I experienced this first hand. I saw some vehicles stop in the live lanes of Front Street to do their drop off or pick up. The whole scene is ridiculous. I'm not sure how the city neglected to address this at all. ",
        "If there is another passenger pick up or drop off location, the Union Station website doesn't mention it. In fact, they don't mention it at all. While many people use ride-sharing, taxis, and transit after leaving the station, there are still many that are being dropped off or picked up by private vehicles. No accommodation for that seems to have been made. ",

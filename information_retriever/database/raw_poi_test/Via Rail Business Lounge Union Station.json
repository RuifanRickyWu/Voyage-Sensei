        "The business lounge is stocked with water and juices, coffee from a coffee machine. There may have been some fruit in a bowl. Lots of seating and TVs. I was greeted upon arrival and told that my train would be on the board. I did not hear any announcement about pre boarding but watched a few passengers leave the lounge. Just when I decided I may as well head down another passenger was doing the same. I followed her to come to the end of a long line. We waited briefly and then decided this can’t be right. Broke out of the lineup and paced down the entire station to arrive at the gate where pre boarding was almost complete. We made it. Then to find our right car was another bit of walk which ended with a huge step up onto the train with a few more steps inside. This was a challenge with the luggage. I was offered some assistance at this point. Getting off the train in Montreal was much easier as they brought a small ramp to bridge this gap.",
        "The train ride itself was very comfortable and spacious, I did have a single forward facing seat. The lunch was decent and the service was mostly attentive. Delicious beet salad and pasta dish. I was asked if I wanted to keep my glass for water when they cleared away the dishes. I agreed but they never came back to offer more water. In Montreal boarding was announced, big difference. Arrival in Toronto was confusing. After an escalator ride I found myself back up at the departure level while my partner waited in the arrivals area…… We did connect eventually.",
        "I would travel by train again with ore awareness of things operate differently out of different stations. Lovely picture of the Royal York with reflections on the glass roof of the pedway Toronto Union Station."

I particularly liked the way they maintained the style of the original waiting room, even though it contained modern amenities such as large-screen TVs.",

No enquiry about how my day was going...or even where I was going.  He simply told me my train was boarding and the platform. No smile. No \"have a nice journey.\"  The lounge is where business travelers begin their journey, and where they will get their first impression about the service.  This should be the easiest thing to get right."

        "This was our first train ride in years, so glad we decided to go with business class, the station, shops and underground system is having major work done to it, so to be able to get a small quiet place was worth the extra cost. To have your luggage taken and loaded by the staff sorts out the struggle to do it yourself. Coffees, soft drinks and fruit are available as well as a comfy seat."

        "The lounge was only a precursor to a VERY disappointing 4 night trip Vancouver to Toronto. The only positive thing I can say about this vacation(?!) was that the staff was pleasant.  The food was mediocre, the wine was subpar, the (prestige) cabin was claustrophobic.  So many opportunities were not met; announcements could have been made as to what lake you were looking at/what province we were in etc.  A lecture could have been provided that explained how the train operates/ what different signs meant etc.   This could have been enjoyable and for the outrageous price it should have been.  The mini bar was stocked with water not\" your preferred beverages\".  (I have nothing against water, but...)   To top everything else we arrived in Toronto at 11:40 NOT 2:30; we could have flown home that day and not have to stayed over."

        "When you arrive at the Toronto station do ensure your luggage meets the size criteria. If not, you will have to unpack the essentials into bags. Best advice is stick to very small essentials for the trip as there is limited space in the sleeper cabins.",
        "The lounge area is great with complimentary refreshments. Staff very helpful before and after you board.",
        "The train ride to from Vancouver to Toronto is amazing but beware it does not keep to any real timetable due to cargo trains having right of way first . We were 9 hours late … don’t book any afternoon or evening events! Train was great and the food and service very nice indeed. Worth the time and money . Great experience and met some wonderful people. Cabins cosy and do the job. No or very limited phone signal and no free internet service ."

The subway serves the area (St. Andrews station) as well as the King Streetcar. King Street, the heart of the district, has no parking on it and cars cannot travel more than one block on the street without being forced to make a turn onto a side street. A great place to stroll on a summer night."

St. Patrick subway stop only 1 short block away.  I love live theatre & concerts.  There are often children's concerts at Roy Thompson Hall & you might be able to catch something like The Lion King.  For seating at Roy thompson Hall, if you aren't obsessed with seeing the whole orchestra while you're listening to the music, the cheaper seats are just as good as the best seats.  There are often short concerts at noon that are free.....check the internet or the newspaper.  For the Royal Alexander Theatre.....get good seats on main floor, especially if you are taller than 5'6\".  I had to leave a good play because we were in the first balcony & I was getting cramps in my legs.  Don't go to the top balccony to sve money....we call them the \"nose-bleeders\".  This is a very old theatre with few washroom & public spaces......so go to the washroom before the play.  Having said all this, I still love this theatre.  One suggestion if you want to save money on tickets, get the very last row of the orchestra if some are available.  These seats are elevated & are the best seats in the house.....a Torontonian secret."

The cast that operated the horses did a extremely good job.  I was I was in Toronto longer just to experience more shows."

        "This mall is different from Fairview, Yorkdale, and other Toronto shopping centres. Better suited to meeting with friends, I didn’t see a single tyke in various doors we entered. You can expect an outdoor version of Bayview Village Mall with relatively higher end boutique shops and eats, which appeals to the well-heeled or to senior Torontonians. Like Palm Springs, there are plastic or cosmetic surgery /Botox clinics (Dr Fred Weksberg ‘Dermapure’); and there’s luxury services, including photography/jewellery restoration and my favourite: The Eleven bicycles elite repair shop. However, most women with kids prefer paying to send theirs on the little electric Choo-Choo train while shopping for clothes. I don’t consider this much of a family but rather a friends’ meeting point. The bars are open for happy hour (5:00-7:00); and restaurants like Anejo offer overpriced but tasty food. It is one of the rare glass-enclosed patios in this part of the city. Taylors Landing also opens for supper. You can get indoor/outdoor izakaya next door here, where the restaurant turnover is high. We normally head to buy Salomon near Aritzia and Lindt chocolates before closing. There isn’t enough disabled parking, but if you’re looking to do shopping & lucky, you’ll get a spot nearest the West entrance at North Ground in the parkade behind McEwen’s food market. It’ll be a shorter trek to Shops at Don Mills from there. Have a fun stroll, and bring an umbrella if the weather turns inclement!"

The whole area is an upscale streetscape atmosphere, and while we did not take the time to explore any of the stores in the complex, we definitely will return to see what else is on offer at this location.  It is located, conveniently, just west of the Don Valley Parkway, at Lawrence Avenue.  We have added another convenient Toronto 'attraction' to take our Grandchildren to.  This is important to us, because we often are picking up after school, and are stuck in rush hour traffic.  It is great to have a 'feel safe' spot to go, have dinner, and browse, as we wait out the traffic on the 'Don Valley Parking Lot'."

We like this about the new mall. When it was an inside mall they had a lot of your standard shops and services--just what you would find at almost anywhere across the GTA the exceptions being Eaton Centre, Sherway Gardens, Yorkdale, etc. this is different. They have a skating rink surrounded by shops and restaurants. All of the shops and restaurants are individual buildings that you walk outside to get to. I like the concept. I like the selection of shops and restaurants. "

        "I used to hangout at this place when I was staying close by. This place is filled with a lot of stores making it a perfect spot to shop everything you would need. There are good photogenic spots here. It's best if you take your own time to explore the area. There's parking space almost everywhere. The weather was pleasant during my visits and, I enjoyed my time here. There were people around but, it wasn't crowded. If you're a group, you'd definitely have fun here. This is Ontario's first and finest open air centre with exceptional shops, restaurants and services surrounding a lovely Town Square. Be sure to drop by!"

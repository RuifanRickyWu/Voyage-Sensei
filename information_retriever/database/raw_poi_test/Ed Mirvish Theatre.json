  "description": "The Ed Mirvish Theatre began its life in 1920 as a combination vaudeville and motion picture theatre in the Pantages theatre circuit. With its original 3373 seats, it was the largest cinema in Canada and, with its lavish interior - designed by the great theatre architect Thomas Lamb - the most elegant. David Mirvish officially renamed the iconic building The Ed Mirvish Theatre on December 6, 2011.",

        "I saw Mamma Mia here twice as part of it's 25th Anniversary Tour and was thoroughly impressed with the theatre staff and the production. I've personally not been a big fan of some of the previous Mamma Mia tours that Worklight Productions has produced, with a reduced pit of 6 musicians and a scaled back and smaller set but this tour hit all the right notes. ",
        "The set on this tour while it's similar to previous tours of Mamma Mia that Worklight has produced,  is bigger than in previous productions. The casting for this tour is top notch bringing together lead performers from previous productions of Mamma Mia- the North American Tour, Las Vegas and Broadway while pairing them up with plenty of fresh new talent. ",
        "Equally impressive was the band which was led by both Matthew Croft and Daniel Klintworth. The music was rich, full, loud and heavy and even though it was played by a pit of 6 musicians and they sounded incredible. ",
        "This 25th Anniversary Tour is definitely worth taking a chance on!!!"

        "Earlier this month, my family of 4 attended Les Miserables at Princess of Wales. We were very excited to venture into Toronto for this production. Much to our disappointment one of our four seats were double booked. We purchased our tickets in January and we chocked this could happen. We brought this to the attention of the ushers and to avoid further disruption to the patrons surrounding us they had my daughter sit alone for quite sometime until they made other arrangements for the double booked patron. I brought this to Audience Services via email and was told this was impossible that seats were double booked. Although the ushers and all of us saw the ticket stating the same seat as ours - they basically called me a liar. I requested someone call me after several frustrating emails and did not receive a call. They told me they have a very strict no refund policy - even when they made twice the money selling the same seat. After much frustration, we accepted concession vouchers for two for the next performance we attend. Shortly after we received vouchers for a total of $13 when our tickets cost $478. I was not provided the name of any person emailing me from Audience Services nor a phone call to discuss. I’ve been a patron for decades and was so extremely disappointed in the error. Mistakes happen but they customer service was way less than satisfactory"

        "To Kill a Mockingbird, with Richard Thomas and cast was absolutely amazing!   The story was somewhat different from the movie and was closer to the novel. The acting was phenomenal, especially Mr Thomas’ and Ms Moynihan’s performances.  At 3 hours, including a 15 min intermission, the story moved along quickly.  The powerful message —-particularly Mr Thomas’ final summation in court —-was delivered expertly.  Highly recommended."

I loved the book by Harper Lee and was so impressed how the messaging of racism and community forgiveness was such a strong message in the show.  They nailed the story and received a standing ovation. Richard Thomas as the !star was a perfect pick for Atticus and Melanie Moore as Scout was spot on! All the cast were brilliant in their roles.",

        "Thoroughly enjoyed \"In Dreams\" -  a moving, original story featuring the songs of Roy Orbison. The performances are excellent, with a mainly British cast supporting American Lena Hall. a past Tony winner recently named  UK Theatre Award \"Best Performer in a Musical\"  for the In Dreams premier in Leeds this summer. Orbison was renowned for the emotional intensity of his songs. Playwright David West Read has skillfully woven about 20 of these songs into his story of a band singer facing newly-diagnosed cancer in the company of former band-mates and regulars at a Mexican-American restaurant that also hosts memorial services. The sets, costumes, choreography, and musical direction are all first-class and contribute to an outstanding production that earned a well-deserved standing ovation. Planning to attend again during this run at the Ed Mirvish Theatre."

The storyline was thin at best and some characters were there just to fill out the cast, not that they added anything to the plot.  Orbison’s music was screamed, screeched and wailed.  Very poor tribute to an extraordinary songwriter and performer."

I had waited so long to finally see this show, and it did not disappoint. I'm still in a state of disbelief that I actually saw it! And the Ed Mirvish was such a perfectly beautiful venue."

        "After listening to the soundtrack for weeks before seeing the show my impression of Alexander Hamilton was that he was one of those in-your-face, slightly obnoxious types.  And yet, the actor playing Hamilton chose to play him almost as a shy introvert.  I didn't think that this personality suited the songs he was singing and therefore found them hard to believe.",

On the other hand if you go into the show not having heard the soundtrack you may enjoy it more because you have no preconceived ideas.  Either way I would not miss this show!"

Our seats were in the orchestra section, back row which was fine however,  we were directly infront of the entrance doors and to our left was the A/V booth which I wasn't aware of initially when I booked them.  This proved to be extremely annoying and disruptive as the show started. The gentleman at the booth kept shuffling papers throughout the performance and people were allowed to get up and leave and enter throughout which kind of surprised me because I remember when you could only get up during intermission.  So the constant opening and closing of the doors was irritating. Not only that but some ushers would talk right behind us. ",
        "The show itself was spectacular as the cast was amazing. The special effects and sounds were movie worthy, but the constant disruptions ruined the ambience for us. Another thing was the back lighting on the walls which were on the entire show and over the entrance as well. It made us feel like we were under a street lamp. This also made us feel out of the show. I understand they are there for safety but they could have been a bit dimmer. I would definitely go see it again but make sure my seats were in the middle center. So in short, great show, not so great atmosphere."

The characters floating in midair, the swift actions of the characters, it’s just brilliant! When I had taken my seat and glanced up, it was a spiraling dome with colors, which was still beautiful when the lights dimmed. Wonderful staff, with high quality performances coming from the actors! It has a certain quality to it, that gives it its Broadway touch. With dramatic moments, as well as humorous, it’s a great show for people of all ages! It’s certainly a fun thing to do with the family, or even just going solo! There was a moment that still leaves me dazed, and it was when a Dementor left the stage and flew over the crowd directly above our heads! Tickets aren’t to hard to find for groups of 2 generally. I would highly recommend this, as this is an experience I won’t forget."

He appeared to be nervous and somewhat ill prepared for the task at hand. He did settle down and flubbed only one line, that I noticed, after the opening.",

Had I known that this would be the case I never would have purchased the tickets, certainly not at that price. But I expect that management knows that if they inform the public that the stars will not be performing  not as many customers would purchase tickets; choose not be disrespected in this way.",

The lobby was packed at intermission and it was very difficult to move around. The doors also were not opened for at least 20 minutes after the the time written on the ticket. I have gone to mirvish productions before and had a quality theatre experience and this is the first time I have had such an overall disappointing experience.  The theatre is not a good fit for the play. The theatre is not worth the price of the tickets."

Very long 3 hours. The best parts were the dementors (very cool), Scorpius and Albus swimming under water, and the performer playing Moaning Myrtle (she was amazing, big kudos to her). The play reminded me more of community theatre with major production ticket prices. Too expensive for the value imo."

Other than the inconveniences of intermission, we had an absolute blast."

The leads were almost all understudies which is ok im they were good but something just lacked they didn’t activate peoples mics at some points etc, it just lacked the excitement of the first time ",

        "I honestly loved it here and would definitely recommend this place to anyone who wants to go to an amusement park that doesn't have crazy fast rides. I believe these rides were made with younger children in mind however they aren't exclusively for them. Most rides have seats that are big enough to fit an adult so you won't feel awkward riding them. I personally really loved the sky chair and went on it multiple times. It's so relaxing and the view was so beautiful!! The line wait for the rides was pretty short and you could definitely finish all the rides in the park multiple times in a few hours. It's quite cutely designed and I really loved the vintage carnival theme they were trying to go for. "

It sounds like it was our fault. We complained  that it’s not fair for us as we bought ticket for one ride, and this is not our problem having technical issues. And at the end she let us ride again but her attitude is really bad, and she say ‘JUST GO!’ Very rudely, ",
        "I  have never thought of a famous amusement park can treat a customer like this, and we are very upset from that girl, we try to look for the supervisor, hope he can do something with girl’s attitude, and then he just said “what do you want from me?!you have your second ride at the end! I am the boss, I will handle it.” The whole thing is absolutely disrespectful , disappointing!! I have never have such bad experiences in another amusement park before! When i said I would like to have a formal complaint, he writes me his name JORGE with the ticketsales email. They don’t even have a proper customer service hotline, they don’t have anyway to make a complaint. ",
        "This SUPERVISOR JORGE is not doing anything to deal with the customer complaint, the girl in that  Jake’s livery & Garage has no knowledge to deal with customer when it comes to technical issues. And she is rude to customers."

        "This park is designed for kids ages 12 and under - but they do manage have to have some rides that appeal to older kids - the bumper cars actually let you bump - and the Scrambler in the dark is fun as long as the DJ picks decent music.  The Haunted House ride is getting a bit run down but its good for laughs and jump scares.  For the really old people the train ride and the ski-lift ride are also enjoyable.  Attached is the Far enough farm which is kind of a petting zoo.   Also fun note outside Centerville there is a hedge maze that is ideal for parents as it only has one entrance/exit."

It only clearly states that the log flow is closed, but once you pay the full price, well, good luck.  The map and staff won't mention how many things are closed because it's just too many. Wonderland has shows, more rides, and things to do for around the same price. If you're thinking, but I'd have to pay for parking, well, you have to ride a ferry, which is great if it follows its schedule. Not often.",
        "Centreville has some great attractions, but the safety of the place is in question. Take a ride on the Sky ride and enjoy knowing that your child could easily fall as there's nothing securing you in place. The bar that comes over top is held in place by gravity. The bumper cars have these large, solid pieces of metal with no padding, and you wait until you hit and your child's leg hits the bar and cries. The haunted barrel works is a sad version of what it used to be, as many things are fixed in place now and don't move.",

This means everyone in your party has to wait in this slow line. Lastly, by the time we left, the bathrooms were getting to be in rough shape."

Note that there is lots of flooding on the island (due to the high lake levels) so you will need to ride on the boardwalk to get around the flooding.  Had a great picnic lunch that we brought on the grass and then spent the afternoon on the rides.  We all got ride bracelets so were able to have lots of fun trying all the rides and since the line-ups weren't too bad, were able to ride some rides ++ times.  Suggest getting your ticket for the ferry on-line ahead of time so that you don't need to wait in the long line at the ferry terminal."

The three girls were settled on the ride and then the gate shut, leaving one alone.  When the girls on the ride stood up to explain to the young man running the ride what had happened he would not listen and refused to allow the last girl through, despite there being space on the ride for her next to her sister, therefore leaving her completely alone in the line. Very poor judgement shown by this worker and it really but a sour end to an otherwise lovely day out."

        "we buy a family pass which is for 4 people, so we can ride on all the rides, but actually we don't have enough time to play all of them, as some of them required a long waiting time, e.g. the roller coaster need to wait for an hour, it's too much time, and the swing also need to wait for half to one hour, so we can't play this one and the bumper car as we don't have enough time, we already spend 5 hours there, but still not enough time to play all rides. But we do tried a number of rides, e.g. the lift chair, the boat, ferris wheel, and some younger rides for my kids. We do have a happy day except we can't ride all we want due to super long waiting time for some of the rides."

        "Childhood memories and the tradition continues. We took our 2 granddaughters to Centre Island on a Thursday mid day end of August. Prior to our visit it rained but rest of the day was nice and sunny! We got there by Tiki Taxi private water taxi that leaves the docks at the foot of Spadina and very glad we weren’t packed into the larger ferry.  We purchased wrist bands for the whole family and enjoyed the freedom to go on all the rides. There were no line ups at all except for maybe one or two children and we managed to get to all rides we wanted to try during our visit. It was a nostalgic visit as some rides looked the same as when I was a young child. Each ride was well maintained. There was no wait to buy pizza, subs or ice cream and the we found a quiet spot under the trees in the outdoor eating area. Other than a few wasps our outdoor eating experience was perfect. We found the ride staff to be quite helpful and pleasant. We finished the day with a cool off in the splash pad and found the Muskoka chairs in the shade a nice spot to relax while the girls played in the water. Note - the water refill station faces the splash pad if you need your water bottle filled and washrooms are located back there too. ",
        "I went to this park as a child over 50 years ago and I brought my own children over 25 years ago and now we have let our grandchildren experience the same fun and continue the tradition. Don’t miss this beautiful place for young children and lovely mature parks for a day trip to an island minutes from downtown Toronto. ",
        "Thanks to all the staff at Centre Island for a wonderful day!"

        "- ferry to/from the island was JAMMED. Waited 30 mins for the ferry to the island and watched passengers and crew yelling at each other. Massive line to go back so we bit the bullet and paid for the water taxi back. WELL worth the $12pp- would do that both ways next time. A much calmer experience.",
        "- tried 3x (2 separate cards) to purchase passes online. Ended up having to pay more at the park. We all got all day passes. Could have saved a few dollars if we had just gotten passes for the kids and tickets for adults. There was only a few rides for us “big kids” ",
        "-lunch at cider bar was TERRIBLE. Shortest line so we picked there, still waited 40 mins for cold food. They were out of half of their items. Cashier was fine but the back end staff was rude. Actually rolled her eyes and walked away from a customer asking something simple ",
        "Ride line up weren’t that bad. The little rides usually didn’t even have a line. Longest wait was maybe 30 mins.",
        "Overall, the kids had a great time but it was very expensive and a lot of stress for us adults. We went on a Saturday so that also contributed to the crowds. I think Santa’s village or storybook gardens is an easier adventure."

        "Our main complaint was that on a very hot day in the afternoon it was very difficult to find a place to buy a cold drink. Went to 3 places and waited in line to be told they were out. Finally went to the beaver tails place for frozen strawberry lemonade which was the only drink they had there but it was good. ",
        "The ferry both ways was extremely crowded and the cost was $25 for our family. ",

They need a better system when one buys tickets online, as there is no visible dedicated wicket/window for pre purchase or seasons tickets. We got stuck behind a family of 16! Fun times waiting around like smucks when one buys in advance. And why must employees put on the wrist bands. If adults cannot out those on their kids, they should just hand in the drivers licenses… not hard task and clogs up wickets.",

Fun ride when I had to keep my arm covering a metal bar…not.",

        "Our second visit here in 4 years we found it needed improvement. The fact that there is only one washroom for the entire amusement park was ridiculous! I had 2 kids crying behind me in line because they couldn't wait any longer and there were still 20 people lined up in front of us. I also waited over an hour just to buy tickets to get in. I had called ahead to ask what the best way to get tickets was (eg:on line), the woman said to not bother booking ahead or online and just get them when we arrive. Crazy. It was sad that we spent so much time in lines waiting and not really getting enough time to ride the rides. Also, food is expensive, 2 hot dogs, 2 fries, 2 drinks was $31.00"

        "To start, the sales process was unprofessional. I encountered a representative who seemed disinterested and dismissive. When I inquired about options, I was shockingly directed to \"take an Uber\" instead of receiving any helpful information or assistance.",
        "Customer service should prioritize the customer’s needs, but instead, I felt belittled and unvalued. This experience left a sour taste, and I couldn't help but feel that my business was unwelcome."

        "We will never use this company again and I don’t recommend anyone else does either. When I called Pearson airport limousine before our trip I asked all the questions in advance so we wouldn’t be thrown off guard. One of my questions was regarding booking our pick up from the airport after our trip. I wasn’t sure how to give an exact time when flight times can change, going through the airport can take time, etc. The gentleman on the other line said “we handle everything. Can you give us your flight information and we will be there. That will be our problem not yours to worry about!” I was also told it is a flat rate. My husband and I thought that was great and stress free! Sadly, on the day we were being picked up from the airport our flight was an hour behind and the conveyer belt broke where our luggage was coming from so we had to wait longer than usual for that. I kept my driver informed even showing him pictures of us all sitting on the floor waiting for our luggage as I didn’t want him to think we were standing him up by not being outside yet. ",
        "I apologized profusely (even though it was out of my control and I can assure you I was more inconvenienced being there with 3 small kids and it was 10pm after a long day of travel). Not once did he reassure me that it was ok or even accepted my apology. Then, when we got into his vehicle he didn’t breathe a word to us. It felt extremely uncomfortable in fact I even text my husband who is sitting right beside me to say that he seemed mad and annoyed. When we pulled into our driveway he turned around and told us we owed him an extra $45 for taking so long coming out. At this point our kids are exhausted, it’s 11pm, we all just wanted to get to bed and felt so frustrated. We explain to him that we were told it was a flat rate and that it wasn’t our fault that our luggage took time coming up. He proceeded to complain to us that he missed picking somebody else up because of us even though our email order when we booked stated that if there was any delays at the airport we could call them when we were ready and they’d come as soon as possible as they may have others to pick up and needed to accommodate everyone. We are not sure why he chose to stay and wait instead of following their protocols but that was his decision to do so and then used it against us. it does not say anywhere on their website or on our order nor did they tell me on the phone that I would be charged extra money if we took to long coming out of the airport. After I said I was going to give a bad review he said “fine I’ll just pay for it out of my pocket.” He was so rude. My husband and I run a business and we would never treat our customers this way. After a long day this was supposed to be easy and stress free, it’s expensive enough ($153 one way to drive us 25 minutes) an extra $45 on top of that would’ve been atrocious all because we were inconvenienced at the airport. It was unkind and unprofessional of him. The only reason I didn’t give a one star is because our driver who took us to the airport on the first day of our trip was polite and on time picking us up.

        "Regardless, I will never use this company again!"

        "We ordered an SUV for our trip to the Dominican. Scheduled pick up was 5:45 AM.  By 5:55 there was no car so I called.  Pushed to voicemail despite showing hours open.  Called again and got a rude individual who said he would check on the driver.  I asked to be out on hold and wait for the response.  Instead he hung up on me and I never heard back.  I called back several times only to go to voicemail.  We ended up having to drive to the airport and have a $200 parking tab waiting for us.  This is absolutely pathetic way to run a business.  I read the reviews (unfortunately after the fact) and saw they blamed one of the reviews on the person having the wrong company!!  I will never use them again and will make sure my friends and family are aware of my story."

        "I booked a suttle to Pearson Airport for me and my family considering 5 adults 1 children with 15 luggage on September 24th at 6am. ",
        "The nightmare started when driver arrived 6minutes late, and we were wondering if he would appear (since it was our first time, not sure if it would be trusted). when he arrived, for our surprise the was driving a Suburban and of course would not fit all of us  and our luggage. The drive simply told us he did not know about the luggage and all he could do was call for another car and it would cost us $100 more... ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS MORE!!!!! I complained about it, because I was very clear on my reservation about quantity of people and luggage and his answer was he could do nothing else. ",
        "As I needed to get my flight and I was on the street with my nice with 2 years old at 6am, I had to agree with it and pay more to arrive at airport. ",
        "When I complained about it with the person who booked it for me, he told it was the car he had for me and also could do anything. I asked the refund for the extra $100 and he never answered it. ",
        "So I think this is the kind of service for this company.  They do not pay attention on what we ask, do everything they want, and if it is not ok for you, you just pay more for it. ",
        "I will never use their service again  and would not recommend to a friend or client.  In my opinion they are not a company we can trust will give a secure service."

We were traveling with our 2 year old and Pearson airport limousine organized a complementary car seat. The driver also supplied bottled water for our drive and allowed us to eat our dinner in the car! Perfect customer service and very reliable!! "

He was very unprofessional! The cab smelt strongly of cigarette smoke. The driver had obviously had a smoke in the taxi on his way to collect us, and I would definitely never recommend this taxi company to anyone."

        "We hired this company after a couple months of getting quotes and reading reviews on the many, many transportation companies in the Toronto area.  We were going from the airport to Niagara Falls, from Niagara Falls to downtown Toronto and then a needed a ride to the airport - three trips over the period of one week.  I booked online with Pearson Airport Limo as well as spoke to their office.  We were a group of eight, ages 11 to 74.  Too many for a taxi and too much hassle for public transportation or a shuttle with luggage for eight.  The drivers were professional and on time for all three trips.  The night before I was given the cell number of the driver picking us up at the airport in case we could not find each other.  He texted me as soon as we landed and was there within minutes of me letting him know we had collected our luggage.  There was bottled water provided in the limo, as well as mints/candies which the kids loved.  The limo was clean and in great shape.  I would highly recommend this company for your transportation needs.  Many have a name similar to Pearson Airport Limo so be careful to book the correct one."

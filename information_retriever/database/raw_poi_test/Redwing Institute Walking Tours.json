Not only did we see beautiful scenery that I would never see on any other tour of Toronto, but I came away learning more about indigenous people, nature, and history. I also learned more about myself and gained some new ways to get more out of my life. The best part is that the blend of gentle exercise and the experiential nature of the three hour programme made it fun, while introducing me to new information on several fronts, I feel inspired, happy and ready to learn more.

It was about 4.5 km of walking but it was over three hours.   We made music, drank cedar tea, ate bannock and maple syrup.   A great learning experience.

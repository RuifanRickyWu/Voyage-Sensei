Can't speak to the quality as we were headed out of town that day and couldn't take anything that would spoil. A few shops with fairly kitschy items, but since we went on a Sunday, there was a second area with all local merchants (kind of like a real-life Etsy) selling a wide variety of items from art to garage sale-type junk to homemade clothes to candles to collectibles. Fun to walk around and I'm sure the vendors change regularly, so it's probably hit and miss. Only open on the weekends, I believe, (possibly only Sundays) so double check that before you go. Parking was easy and close but not incredibly well marked."

This means that the two open sections must both be visited separately. This place is clearly a labor of love for those who work here. The turtles in their pond and large goldfish in a separate one are highlights. the entire place was very lovely and serene. I recommend stopping here if in the area. I would love to see it again once it's fully open."

I'm not sure why but I expected it to be a little larger (if I'm remembering correctly they had approx 3 paths in each with plants on both sides so 5 rows (columns??) of plants with the length of the greenhouse being similar to what a grocery store plant center in spring may have (maybe a little longer??).",
        "Given that and the fact that we didn't stop and study each plant it didn't take too long to go through the 4 greenhouses (I'm going to guess 30 minutes).  The orchid display was underwhelming as the orchids are in a small room in that greenhouse all by themselves and had 10-ish plants (i think), in pots like you'd buy orchids at a store.  Again nice but somehow not what i was expecting.  The rest of the displays were great.  Cactus (I think) growing horizontal near the ceiling and the house with water (koi and turtles included) were great.",

Be kind and compassionate, and put yourself in their shoes rather than jumping to the worst conclusions."

Little decorative touches for Christmas, so not sure how that is different during summer months. Easy to get to with TTC (3 stops on the 75 bus from Sherbourne station, less than a min walk to park). Can see it all in an hour. Washroom on premises. Can use wheelchair but hard to navigate around some of the corners. Few benches around to sit and enjoy the view. "

We had a chance to speak with one greenhouse keeper who has loved her job there for seven years.  She explained how she chose the various displays and the autonomy she has.  That added to our experience.  This is a relatively small place (not like the Garfield Park Conservatory in Chicago) but is is free and refreshing change on a winter day.  It is free, but their website lists incorrect hours!  On the day we arrived (a Monday or Tuesday) it only opens at noon, not 10:00 so we stood around outside in the snow waiting for opening."

I will certainly be returning for the other seasonal displays as they change through the year. It isn't large but it also wasn't overly crowded. I did notice signs for children's workshops which would be interesting for a family group."

I decided to explore some lesser known Toronto spots around the ballet area.  A friendly gal at Tim Hortons suggested Allan Gardens and I’m so glad she did.  I was pleasantly surprised to find out that admission was free and the walk around the park to the building was lovely.  As soon as I entered, it was as though I had transported to somewhere very different from the hustle and bustle of the city.  It was peaceful, warm, and absolutely beautiful.  I took my time and walked slowly though making sure to notice details and take it all in.  I loved the Christmas decor mixed in with the more permanent plant displays.  I especially loved the turtle pond and spent quite a bit of time watching them.  Overall I spent about 2 hours visiting with some of that just relaxing on a bench with my book.  I would definitely visit again when in Toronto and recommend it for all ages. "

        "I didn't know what to expect and I was pleasantly surprised! We spent 30-60 minutes exploring the 5 themed areas: cactus, palms, etc. The gardens are beautiful and well maintained. The Conservatory is quiet and peaceful, with few visitors. We took pictures of neat plants and lovely displays. I highly recommend visiting the Conservatory if you're in the area!"

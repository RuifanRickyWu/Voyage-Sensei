      "text": [
        "I shall begin by mentioning that I adore the lounge at Spa myBlend. I've been coming over the past few years for a Birthday massage as it's conveniently located, spacious, and their lounge area has lavish lounge chairs and cushions where you can relax and order food or beverages. I enjoy the feeling of luxury on my special day. ",
        "Unfortunately, that is where the luxury of the experience ended this year. This December I went for a joint manicure with my sister, and scheduled my massage afterwards with an hour buffer. It was my sister's first time to have a manicure, and so I thought it would be nice to have our manicures together, relax in the lounge for some food and a beverage before my annual Birthday massage. In fact, we had to upgrade our manicures to $105 each for a \"Signature manicure\" in order to use the lounge and facilities (which I thought was distasteful seeing as we're already paying a large amount). ",
        "While the facilities and ambiance were nice, unfortunately the manicure was the worst quality I have ever had, full stop. I have had $20 manicures before, and so being at the Ritz, I expected an elevated level of sophistication. However, all my $20 superseded this one. The polish did not go near the edge of my nails, you could see where each layer started, the nail shapes were not consistent, my cuticles were not trimmed, and the nails on my right hand are noticeably longer than my left. With the dim lighting I could not tell how terrible it was until we entered the lounge. I felt quite awkward since I'm not someone that likes to send anything back, and I'm very grateful for the experiences I'm afforded. But my sister turned to me in horror when looking at my nails and helped me realize I should assert myself in this case. I spoke with reception who brought management over. Anna, the manager was lovely. She redid my nails, however there were still some issues with the length, since one hand had already been cut way too short, and the paint layers - you could still visibly see the edge of each layer. However, it was now past one hour into my buffer time and so I had to run to my massage late. Not only did I not have time to spend with my sister in between, but when she ordered food, they made her pay right away instead of when we leave because of some change in the system. Instead of this being a relaxing experience, I was rushing around trying to make the best of the day. We ended up having to eat the lunch we ordered at 4pm when it was cold. Anna provided a couple of glasses of prosecco in the meantime, and was extremely apologetic. ",
        "I debated posting this review, but when you're paying this much for a manicure, and it's your Birthday as well as your sister's first experience, it's even more disheartening when a $20 manicure would have been better. While my sister paid, and they offered a tax discount, she basically basically paid $100 for someone to unevenly cut my nails, which I now have to grow out so they don't look silly. I'm ashamed and embarrassed for the Ritz brand. Please do better in the future, this is simply unacceptable. I will be taking my Birthday massages and other business elsewhere for the time being."

The massage was o.k. having use of the facilities was great.  Getting a hold of reception and booking was a challenge but handled quite well and efficiently after initial contact. Great snack throughout.  I wouldn't say much has changed since Covid except I do remember paying for the spa and the meal together, I could be wrong, but be aware there is a 18% tip on each of the bills, food and spa, which were separated.  The reception seemed a bit on the inexperienced side for a 5 star spa, but definitely trying their best. Not the warmest reception for a world renowned establishment.  I would def go again."

        "Me and my husband visited the spa for our anniversary. It wasn‚Äôt our first visit at this spa, but first since Covid. The spa is the same, good massage and overall good facilities and snacks. The only thing that changed in the costumer service in the spa reception and the new 18 percent tip. Usually the asking you if you celebrate something like birthday or anniversary and nobody asked as not in the reception or our RMTs so we felt a little disappointed. We asked the girl in the reception and she had different excuses, but they gave us 2 glasses of Prosecco. But the main complain is about tipping. Since when we have to tip at the spa? After the visit at the reception they give you a bill for your massage + tax + 18  percent tip and say it‚Äôs up to you. They put you in uncomfortable position like you must to give a tip. It‚Äôs not ok if I want to tip my RMT I will do  that , but they just give you bill with tip in it and put you in uncomfortable situation. So we just left more than 90 dollars tip but after we felt that they made us to do that and it wasn‚Äôt our decision. The price went up for the massage but the costumer   service went down and the new tip policy trick also not adding to the overall experience. So be aware and ready!"

        "Spa myBlend is my favourite spa in Toronto. Although I have not been back in a couple years due to the pandemic, I was interested to see if the quality was still the same. I was not disappointed! I had a lovely deep tissue massage by the lovely Emily. Spent the rest of my time resting in their co-ed sanctuary and female-only lounge and using their facilities. One downside to their whirlpool, is there is only space for 2, so when the spa gets busy, you have to wait a bit to use it.  The showers are very impressive with rain shower head, handheld and jets on the walls! All the staff are very helpful and really quick to refill snacks, towels, etc. The only suggestion I have would be to upgrade the robes and towels, I found my robe to be well worn. Other than that, it was an excellent stay and i can't wait to go back!"

        "Overall, the facilities are nice and our time was fun - but not necessarily as relaxing as we wanted it to be. It felt very busy throughout the day - not only with other guests but many staff that we kept running into. The no-talking lounge area was spoiled by the door constantly opening and closing and occasionally, a tour of the facilities for new guests. We found most of the relaxing spaces to be ruined by conversations from other guests. In addition, comparable to the Four Seasons and Miraj Hammam for example, the facilities are smaller, especially the pool area. The vitality pool was a bit messy with a few used towels lying around. ",
        "On the plus side, we received complimentary champagne for my friend's birthday and the lunch menu was extensive - although, I must have gotten mild food poisoning because as soon as I ate the veggie burger I ordered, I had an awful, painful stomach ache that lasted into the evening. We actually left early because of this. ",
        "The massage I received (deep tissue) was average - nothing special. I personally like to have my massage in silence but my masseuse, unfortunately, was chatty! ",

My friend who didn't want to celebrate her 50th was so happy and by the time our husbands showed up (only 3 of us were at the birthday) we had a fun dinner for 6. Oh and we stopped in the Ritz bar for a cocktail before dinner. Needless to say all ladies were relaxed from the spa day and very tipsy at dinner but very happy with a great event to talk about for years to come. If I could plan everyone's 50th, this would make the cut. Not cheap but worth every penny. For $99 the event was good value."

Beyond this change room is the communal waiting area where you can meet your significant other while you wait for your massage therapist. The massage itself was very good, I enjoyed the slightly heated bed and the smells of the oils they used. That was probably the fastest hour ever! I didn't want it to end. It's hard to find any flaws. The only drawback is the hefty price tag, couples massage included tip was just over $500.00! But i've been to some other spa's where the price is in the $150-200 range per person, if you're spending that much, you might want to consider spending a few more dollars and experience the spa at the Ritz!"

It felt like I was always on top of another guest, the locker area was not ample. The wet area was great because it had a steam room and a sauna, but the little two-person hot pool in the middle of the room was a strange layout (and not all that comfortable or flexible). One of the showers is definitely sub-par compared to the other two showers. The amenities required constant replenishment because very few towels, etc. were laid out available for guests. I disliked the disposable plastic drinking glasses and the water cooler was tepid at best. There wasn't really any lounge furniture in the wet area which was disappointing. The men's only waiting area wasn't as comfortable or as well-appointed as the mixed gender waiting area, which really is impressive. It was awkward to have to walk through the spa reception, down a long corridor and the elevator bay to access the pool area. The massage I had was good (exactly what I expected, but nothing to define or distinguish it as unique or exceptional), but the amenities and experience overall wasn't commiserate to the cost of the spa appointment when compared to other hotel spas in Toronto."

I had to fold my towel to create a double layer before sitting down because the seating was insanely hot. I don't think I was in the room longer than 15 seconds before I frantically ran out because the heat of the room was SCORCHING my skin and scalp. I used the hot tub instead and watched customers go into the steam room only to run out seconds later. I asked some of them if the room was infact abnormally hot or if it was just me. They all confirmed something felt wrong.",

I expressed that I was disappointed that I could not use the steam room. She apologized and said she would call the engineering team to look into it because the heat could not be controlled. Shortly after, she walked over, turned the heat completely off and then opened the door of the steam room to let all of the steam completely out. I moved onto the relaxation room thinking she was working on the solution. An hour later, she came back and said the steam room was free to use. Excited, I walked back over only to go into a room that had ZERO steam and wasn't even warm inside. Was this really her solution? ",
        "Justine had asked if I was having a service done that day. I got the impression from her that because I wasn't dropping money with the spa that day other than my $35 lunch, she was disengaged from creating a good experience. I expressed to her again that I was disappointed that the amenities were not provided in working order but she gave me \"I've done my best\" talk. When asked upon check out if I enjoyed my time, I mentioned my disappointment again in a gracious way only to be responded to with a \"sorry.\"",

There are several spas in Toronto that are comparable in price, if not cheaper, and can offer full amenities and most importantly, great customer service. Kudos to Bridgette for handling an unpleasant situation with grace and compassion but I was extremely disheartened by Justine's disinterest in creating a solution and managing the situation properly. Even a discount off of the lunch or complimentary glass of wine offered would have been a gesture of good will. There are other great options in the city of Toronto--save your dollars."

The lounge is nice and relaxing as well."

Service was *excellent*.",

This is reversed only at the request of the client- and makes it very uncomfortable for the client.  I understand that you will likely respond that this helps cover the service personnel, but this does not warrant such practices.  This is absolutely unethical and your management should be ashamed of this practice."

The space is lovely - several pools and steam rooms you can use. A lounge area with super high ceilings and natural light to lay back and read/chill. Light refreshments are provided. You have day access to the very well-equipped gym and pool. I didn't get time to fully utilize everything. Would recommend blocking a couple of hours so you can fully utilize the facilities. Bring your swimsuit so you can lounge in the jacuzzi, etc. "

        "Visited Spa My Blend in August 2019 and was looking for a relaxing time with my wife.  We both booked a 90 minute massage, separate unfortunately, which was very solid in my opinion.  The masseuse was knowledgeable, friendly, engaging, and very service oriented.  (Thanks Tony!)  As for the other amenities, I suppose we went into it with higher expectations and expected more things to be co-ed to share with my wife.  Unfortunately, the pool and jacuzzi were located on the opposite side of the spa, as it is shared with the Ritz Carlton residents.  As a result, we didn't end up trying it out as there were kids playing in there and didn't create the mood we had hoped.  The eucalyptus steam room and the hot tub in the gentleman's locker area was solid.  I have to say I spent quite a solid amount of time in there.  And the showers were nice too!  Rain shower! <3  At any rate, the co-ed lounge area was nice and relaxing and their tea selection was nice.  The snacks were a bit....underwhelming (the muffins weren't good at all, the apple rings were soggy, but the pretzels/nuts were fine).  Overall a good/great experience but not as top-end as we had expected.  (Perhaps our expectations were a bit too high)"

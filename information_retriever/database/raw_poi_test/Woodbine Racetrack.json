        "They have a Stella Artois horn instead of a live bugler. Its a pretty cool reaction to see someone make it go off. There are plenty of food options all around the track. The Carvery was pretty good. Lots of places to sit as well as walk around.",
        "There is also a huge casino attached! Looks like they are making it even bigger so prepare yourself. ",

        "Good morning. Normally I have great time at the race track. It was the Kings Plate. I waited 30 minutes to be served at one of the bars. The bartenders wouldn't even look at me. So asked one of them if they could serve me. They took offense and didn't not serve me. I went to another bar in the establishment and bout two beers. When the bartenders at the previous bar saw me with drinks because my friends were still at that stop. They lied and said I was being obnoxious and got the police to escort me. I was so embarrassed. I never swore or was disrespectful. I will never go to would race track again. So 😞!"

        "Admission and parking are free. Escalators are available to the climate controlled grand stand to view the racing.  Part of the Grandstand offers outdoor seating.  There is a fee to enter the Grandstand area to view the \"Kings Plate\" formerly the \"Queens Plate\"  which is held in August of each year.  The seating area , the common areas , and the washrooms are all clean.  The Race Track is very secure and safe place. There is a Food Court area , as well as a Tim Hortons and a restaurant.  The are lots of betting machines as well as a number of wickets for your wagering convenience.  The problem is I could find only one machine to cash your tickets at.  If you don't want to stand in a long line to cash your tickets at a machine , you can stand in a long line to cash your tickets at the wickets/mutuals.  The trick to avoid long lines at the machine or wickets is to cash your tickets between the races a few minutes after the previous race. The staff are friendly and well trained."

She couldnt split a chopped pot, nor could she figure out how to distribute the money in a 3 way all-in hand. Be prepared to be dealt 5 hands in half an hour. Another dealer calls out the cards, then asks: (there's 2 eights on the board) \"so who's got the 8 ? \"",

        "The casino has expanded and it's the size of an airport. As usual the coffee and drinks are free but the machines are usually out of order the same goes for cashiers and Tito machines. Long line ups is common and expect slow service. The place is so big but no escalators to help you across. There is no shuttle bus. The place feels dangerous with minimum security. There are no maps or staff to guide you around this place so expect to get lost. The old casino still looks the same and it's over loaded with slots inches apart. it's so crowded it's almost impossible to get anything. Nothing is cheap and usually overpriced. Any breakdowns could lead you to been stuck waiting for up to one hour or two including jackpots to be paid. The place looks under staffed. The parking is terrible you could be waiting a long time for a spot. The whole place is set up to be all high limit. The setup is terrible with tables and slots mixed into one room. Player benefits are terrible and comps are terrible and almost non existent. The horse racing area still looks like a dump. Smoking areas are almost non existent and very far.Its just not a pleasant place to gamble your money."

        "We recently tried Woodbine on the 3rd floor with their own new players called which they call one rewards which separates it from the total rewards card. ",
        "Let me start the the 3rd floor slots and tables gaming floor is cheaply done in a chintzy fashion. The tables they have for eating is manned by 2 servers that are very slow in taking and cleaning the tables. There is a makeshift bar with a refrigerated showcase. All food comes from downstairs. I am not even sure if they had a sink there at the bar. Tables are not cleaned quickly and decor is dollar store type.  A players lounge for  high rollers usually has some sofas to sit on and TV also. etc.",
        "We were informed that the food was comped at this level- unfortunately this is not true. They check your card to see if you have any money sitting in it from your points and that is the one you use for the meals. The menu  is limited and took a long time almost 30 minutes from the time the servers get your order, check your money on the card from the front, and get the food downstairs and bring it up via elevator and the food is cold. For  a high roller room this is poor and shows no customer appreciation for the people that have easily lost  tons of money. Over and above that, the casino hosts are poorly trained to handle requests. Fallsview casino hosts for all players, irrespective of blue, gold and platinum are treated courteously, with respect and there is no nickel and dining with respect from the comps. The host who told us how much we had was okay but after our group had ordered it still had to be verified again by the front host who did not know what she is doing. The walkers also do not know much and if you have a problem with machine, it takes 3-4  attendants before it is rectified. The free fruit plates are not very clean, probably leftover from the buffet downstairs. The health department should check this floor if it is up to standards for food, drinks.",
        "The woodbine 3rd floor machines are tightly wound,and differently calibrated. Sometimes when you get the bonus lines it does not run the bonus. We have played these machines and know when the bonus is to run. SO if you want to waste your money, this is the place.",
        " you are better playing on the first floor. Payback is also on the lower side, even if you are playing high. Card dealers also are a bit stiff so we did not bother to go back and play there. ",
        "I know the new owners are there like any businessman to get their money back  since they are putting the hotel, entertainment and other buildings up, but that have over 20 years to recoup their investment and gouging the customers right now will leave  a bad taste in their mouth.",
        "We went to Mohawk also which is also being run by an investor and they were really empty, especially the high roller room. The  card tables they newly set up was occupied 10%, with their expansion. ",
        "Woodbine is convenient but gaming here has gone top greedy. Staff is poorly trained in  all levels. Washrooms are sometimes closed, and always dirty and filthy. There should be some modicum of health standards in the washrooms that should be enforced with the volume of people they have.",

I waited and looked around for 20 minutes in the area until I saw a staff member in red. She was cranky and unwelcoming. Luckily she was willing to help me page tech.

        "I had the pleasure of visiting this establishment for the Mother's Day Weekend and enjoyed it again. The buffet lunch was a bit on the expensive side and could have had a few more food choices, but since it was more about the company than the meal we had a good time. What I like about this place is that you can enjoy the races while you are having a comfortable buffet meal and when you are done if you are so inclined, you can venture off to the casino. They have really enhanced this establishment since I last went. They now have 3 floors of casino play depending on what your interest is. It was a great day out overall and even though it seemed to have some construction going on in the main casino area, I still consider this place to be a \"HIT\" and would definitely go back again."

        "Made many reviews of how bad this place is but today proved it. Upon arrival we learned the machines to redeem your ticket for any money you won where down you had to line up at the cashiers window to get your money 1 to 2 hour wait. Then the slots broke down if you wanted to cash out you had to wait for an attendant to bring your money wife waited 2 hours 5 minutes to get paid. This place was total confusion no plan in place for computer problems. Since this place has changed hands this place is a total disaster. All they want is your money no customer satisfaction. We where told by casino staff its not our problem you will just have to wait."

        "this is an annual event with my family. there's about 20 of us and we reserve the sofa are at the Stella Artois Terrace. WE had a large section with comfortable sofas. the staff was outstanding!! they took such good care of us including taking us down to see the stables and horses. we loved the food and the environment. it was a perfect day. a couple of the family members visited the casino and won some money in the penny machines. The only downside, is they charge 10.00 per person to enter the terrace, which seems unfair since we all ordered lots of drinks and food.  oh and one other thing...you have to reserve seats online and we could not reserve 20 seats so we had to select groups of 4. we tried calling to see if we could combine the seats to one area and left endless number of messages with NO call back. in desperation, we somehow got the restaurant manager who was amazing and took care of our seating requirements. otherwise we loved it!!"

The weather was great we were seated in front of the winners post and we had an excellent meal and drinks. The staff made it a great afternoon for us helping us with our betting and we even managed to win some races. We thoroughly enjoyed our afternoon and would recommend it to anyone wanting to try something different."

The so-called \"Champions bar\" has no windows facing the track but a series of TVs and automated \"wagering machines\" that makes for a sad, and hollowed out cavern, designed to separate customers from their money in as fast a fashion as possible. Without the slightest interest in entertainment, cuisine or the majesty of the horses, Woodbine is now on my \"must miss\" list for things to do in Toronto."

        "I can’t say enough about our wonderful day yesterday at Woodbine racetrack to celebrate my mom‘s 70th birthday. From the second I started making the reservation, everyone was so incredibly helpful in making this day so special. Vanessa was the person I was contacting back-and-forth about our reservation, and she could not do enough to make sure all 24 of us were seated together and in a way that made it accessible for my mom‘s wheelchair.    We had the perfect spot and after much moving around she was able to accommodate all of us on the same level side-by-side.  The waitress was great and even with all 7 little kids kept us happy and attended to through the whole 7 hours (sorry I can’t remember her name 😔)! ",
        "The other person I want to highlight is Jan, the lady who gave us the paddock tour, as well as the special gift of going to the announcers booth that my parents, aunt and uncle received as part of one of the birthday options. She was so friendly and so  helpful, giving us such an enjoyable experience. My mom really had the most wonderful time and it’s thanks to these ladies in particular for going over and above to make it perfect. We enjoyed it so much and even with the 7 kids lasted the whole day of racing and can’t wait to come back. We are already planning our next visit! Thank you for helping us create a beautiful day of memories! It’s the little things that make these events so special and these two added so many little touches through their kindness ❤️"

They have the casino and we went on the Queen Plate day which it the reason I think we didn’t like it.  It was get to dress up, take pictures and listen to music.  But it was so crowed.  Hard to find a spot to eat. Try to see the horse up close.  Lines were so slow for everything.  We couldn’t appreciate the experience. "

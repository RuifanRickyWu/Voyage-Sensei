        "I really enjoyed this tour. There were only 5 of us on it and the guide was very knowledgeable and interesting. Although it was a long time 90 minutes plus, it wasn't too far to walk and at a leisurely pace. We often found a wall to sit on to save the back as well. My husband felt some of the guides opinions a little erroneous but I didn't. We did feel that although we had a couple of hangers on, that wasn't a problem but there were times when one of them occupied the guides time too much and we were left waiting for the guide to finish talking to her. I would have liked her to wait until we had completed our tour to answer her questions."

        "We had Kiran as our tour guide (I hope I spelt that right) and when my Mother and I first arrived at Toronto, we honestly hated it. It's a confronting change from being at home and we felt very uneasy as two women. We arrived at our tour with Kiran in a group of 9 on a whim for something to do and he talked about the homeless population of Toronto, what it's like to live here and showed us some incredibly interesting things. All while doing so he made sure we were all safe and answered absolutely any questions we had and was absolutely hilarious to listen to and made sure to liven things up with jokes when the stories got a little dark. He also had a personalised list of the best places to eat in Toronto which he gave out at the end. It definitely helped lift our view on Toronto and we wish we had done it on our first day here. Thank you."

Not sure why, as no one in the group was able to bring about a change here.",

However, our guide proceeded to point out a building across the street and give a detailed and horrifying description of a young boy who was brutally killed and left on the roof the building indicated. With sick stomachs, we moved on to St. Lawrence Market. At that point we were reminded to tip our guide, which we paid to be released.  ",

I also appreciated that she tied in past, present and future details about Toronto. She provided history as well and important socio-political information about the city.

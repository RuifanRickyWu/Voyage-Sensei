        "Toplink Limo warrants a review of their service for a pre-arranged airport pickup we had with them. Our driver, Dean, had tracked our flight and knew when to reach out to us when we were not at the location he had emailed. He was unable to reach us as we inadvertently provided an incorrect number or my backup cell number that had not been switched out of Airplane Mode after landing. ",
        "We did not receive Dean's email with explicit pickup details for location and car identification on our offline phone (lesson learned) and navigating the size of Pearson airport made for a lengthy delay before we decided to call Toplink and meeting with Dean within 60 seconds of starting that call (on my husband's cell).",
        "Dean's thoughtfulness was exceptional, including an offer to swing by somewhere to pick up something to eat (on a fixed price ride) helped make for a very rare memory of the ride home from a 2 week island vacation full of memorable moments."

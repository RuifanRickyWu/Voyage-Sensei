  "description": "Etobicoke is a relaxed area along the Humber River. It's saturated with green spaces and conservatories, making it a premier destination for outdoor sports, hiking, and nature walks. Its abundance of parkland and lakes makes it a typical spot for fishing, picnicking, and camping out, especially in warmer months. The peaceful area is also enjoyed by families, who appreciate its boardwalks and sports facilities. Locals enjoy the variety of golfing and country club opportunities, which also provide lessons for golfers of any skill level.",

Also, with less and less older theatres like this in Toronto it's really nice that it's still around. The atmosphere in the lobby is great, there are lots of snack options, and also beer/cocktail options if you're so inclined. You can see an older movie like Rosemary's Baby on the weekend, or something newer like Dune during the week. Really its just a great place. I've encountered rude staff a total of zero times. The George Orwell clip has definitely lost all effect at this point though and is mostly just funny. If you know you know."

        "Horrible experience! I can't rate the actual theatre, as we never got to the point of actually purchasing tickets. The manager/owner was ready to sell us movie tickets without asking for any proof of vaccination (now required at movie theatres). When I asked if he required proof of vaccination, he said that if I had it I could show it to him. I stated that yes I had it, but for my own safety,  I wanted to know that other people in the theatre were also screened. He said that’s not the way it works and that If I have proof of vaccination I can show it to him. He refused to confirm whether patrons were being screened for proof of vaccination. I advised that we did not want to go into the theatre unless we knew that others were screened for vaccination. There were other patrons in the line asking the same questions; also concerned about the lack of screening. He then stated that we were causing trouble and that we better leave or he would call police. On my way out, he squeezed my arm and very aggressively pushed me out of the theatre. No wonder there are so many reviews of his altercations with customers. Outside I asked many people leaving from the previous show, whether or not they had to show proof of vaccination- they all said that they had not. And when we first arrived, the manager was making popcorn wearing a shield which was pushed up on top of his head and no mask. I'd really love to be able to support this little neighbourhood theatre, but unless there is a change in management, I sure won't be going back!  Extremely rude and aggressive treatment of customers."

He pulled his shield over his face (but still didn't wear a mask) when he finally came to sell us tickets. He refused to answer our question as to whether he checks for proof of COVID vaccination, and, when we persisted and said we do not wish to purchase tickets if he does not screen for proof of vaccination, he kicked us out. He physically and extremely aggressively pushed my friend out the door, then locked the door. The only other party waiting to purchase tickets ran out after us, telling us he had chased them out as well because they wanted to know if patrons were vaccinated. The owner's rude unwillingness to answer our question (he kept saying, \"this is not how it works\") and his aggression were scary. Avoid this theatre at all costs!"

        "A charming OLD movie theatre that claims it originally opened in 1939. Last of the independents. The interior decor appears to support this claim. Old it may be, but it is maintained in very good condition. The building actually contains two movie viewing rooms. The larger one is on the main floor and a smaller one on the second floor. Seats are comfortable and kept in good condition. The lobby also has a quaint old style Bistro size Cafe with an interesting menu of food items, everything from grilled cheese sandwiches to hamburgers and also serves beer and wine. Of course the front counter also serves the usual movie theatre fare of popcorn etc.."

Not only that, they seem to enjoy throwing their weight around with the attitude,\"this is my theatre and if you don't like the rules, buzz off before we call the police and get you thrown out\". Yes, they actually threaten to call the police at the least question you should ask. Go figure! And don't go!"

There is a small waiting area and bar where you can enjoy a drink, beer, wine, coffee, tea, soda, etc. plus a selection of usual movie snacks.  The lone employee on a Saturday afternoon was a \"Jill of all trades\"' selling tickets, refreshments, and ushering us into the theatre at movie time.  It is a large auditorium with very comfy seats and plenty of leg room.  It was so nice to sit comfortably and just watch the movie - no silly games, no endless trailers and commercials, the movie just started at the stated time.  I was with my daughter and after the movie we both commented what en enjoyable experience it was to see a movie at this theatre.  Can't wait to go back."

The owner, hiding behind the counter, berated the server. He scolded her relentlessly. Apparently, she asked a question she shouldn't have. The server maintained her composure, but the way he talked to her made me feel very uncomfortable. I spoke up and told him I didn't feel comfortable with the way he talked to her. He said he didn't want me feeling uncomfortable and insisted he refund our tickets. He kicked us out! The owner clearly needs to take an anger management course. What a horrible person. I will never go back. Plus it's overpriced."

Unfortunately, the movie was in the upstairs (formerly NOSTALGIA CINEMA) which has been re-worked into \"The Screening Room\". A small venue with new, comfortable seats but too close to the wall-sized screen. And the movie was dark and grainy with very poor sound. Very disappointing!",

        "I wanted to like this place. I live downtown so am not often in this neighbourhood, but I went with a friend wanted to see a film that was no longer playing at cineplex. I am a movie buff and have a particular soft spot for old-school theatres like this one, which is much like the kind I attended growing up in 1970s. I much prefer these to megaplexes. But as soon as you enter Kingsway, you sense an unfriendly, unwelcoming atmosphere. The popcorn counter, where you also buy your tickets, has a series of signs posted telling you what you are not allowed to do, with no, no, no everywhere..No Refunds! No exchanges! No outside food or drink! No plastic water bottles! (are you kidding me??) No backpacks or large purses!! (Again, are they serious??) In fact, they are, and I was told I had to leave my backpack with them while I watched the movie. For what reason?  Utterly bizarre No other theatre I have attended, including TIFF, Hot Docs or Mirvish theatres, which all sell alcohol as well, have told me I could not enter the auditorium with a backpack. To top off the \"friendly\" welcome while you wait, there is a giant video screen behind the popcorn stand showing you and others in the line on camera as you wait in line to buy a ticket..the kind of screen a large shopping mall or bank might use in the security office to keep an eye on crime. In a movie theatre?? Really?? ",
        "The auditorium itself was fine, with a large screen and good sound. But I would think twice before returning, here, simply because of the completely unfriendly atmosphere. I don't like being treated as if I am suspected of wrongdoing the minute I walk in."

I tolerated the late showings (often 15 minutes late) and the moldy smell of the theatre because I believed in supporting independent theatres and I enjoyed the films that were screened.  Recently, however, I was told not to bring my purse/backpack into the theatre.  I allowed the clerk to look in my bag but was told not to bring it in.  I then asked to speak to the owner and was told that his information would not be provided to me.  I did find his contact information online and sent him a message.  I got a response from him that wasn't appropriate or professional.  Alas, I will not be frequenting this establishment unless there's a change in ownership.  I will also be telling all my friends and family not to frequent his establishment."

From the small, old school entrance, to the original style theatre, to the retro previews, ads and a great 60's Martian-themed trailer before we watched the Martian, it was a great experience. Free refills on jumbo drinks and jumbo popcorn provided additional value and a cozy, licensed bar and licensed snack counter meant you can enjoy a cocktail beer or wine while you watched. This would also be a great place for a date - uncrowded, intimate and private with a great selection of late run, niche, and old time classic movies. Why bring a date to that generic, sterile giganto-saurus experience when this gem is still out there. I will definitely be back!!!"

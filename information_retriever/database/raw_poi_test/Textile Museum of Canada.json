The exhibit with Canadian textiles over time includes captivating descriptions next to pieces that are reminiscent of stories told through oral history.  The descriptions are interesting, educational and at times funny.  The staff is friendly and helpful and the museum is well-curated.  NOTE: Wednesdays from 5-8pm is 'pay what you can' admission versus a regular admission of $15 for adults.  The museum shop is also a wonder of all kinds of textiles and a wide assortment of books on the topic - great for unique gifts.  If you like textiles, definitely plan to visit this museum."

We arrived right when the museum opened and had it to ourselves for the first little while which was a lot of fun.  It took us about an hour and a half to get through the two exhibits and do a little shopping at the gift shop, so it is easy to do this and then still have time in your day for another excursion. If you love textiles or are looking for a unique arts experience, this is well worth a visit."

        "Staying at the Super 8 a bit west of the park, it was a pleasant stroll as I headed east. It is always nice to see any green space in a large city. This one is a cut above. There was a large enclosure for dogs to run around unleashed. There were extensive play areas for children, one sign indicating no adults unless accompanied by a child. Located and very much associated with the Art Gallery of Ontario to its north, some unique sculpture work is on display, including pieces by the world famous sculptor Henry Moore. The park’s history is interesting. From the early 19th century, it served as the front lawn area of The Grange, the family residence of the Boulton family. An elliptical path for carriages of that bygone era has been kept. The area was reopened to the public in 2017, under the supervision of the Grange Park Advisory Committee. Keeping the historic theme, the park is anchored on its northern side by The Grange, a Georgian manor house. I suspect it the park looks even better in the summer when splash pads are a welcome relief from the heat."

The park itself is well maintained and a nice green spot in the heart of the city with plenty of people relaxing in the grass and kids enjoying the play facilities. It is however, greatly enhanced by the neighbouring Ontario College of Arts and Design building, which has a highly unusual annex called the Sharp Centre which stands on tall stilts and dominates one end of the park. Also of note is a fantastic Henry Moore sculpture (Two Large Forms) at the West side of the park."

There was a post that the new owner was observed not washing his hands after using the toilet, you can imagine what the kitchen looks like. Should have listened to the voice of experience and not try it on ourselves. Avoid. ",

        "The Thai place is not bad - they have a decent soup option, try it in the winter, its filling and tasty. The take out options are neither healthy nor fresh, but if you are hungry and willing to eat more tempura bits than chicken - this it it. ",
        "The Korean \"Bowl\" keeps changing owners, but serves standard Korean fare. Not bad. ",
        "The Cafe Sushi is good, fresh and tasty, a bit pricier than the Garden Sushi, with smaller portions. ",

A small price to pay for the comfort of this tucked away spot.  The menus are inspired -- fresh, ever-changing, eye-catching, and of course delicious;  it's quiet, and it's comfortable. And, once refreshed with a light lunch and perhaps a latte, one is just steps from re-visiting the galleries."

        "I am almost ashamed to admit that this lounge for members only open for lunch is a major reason why I renew my AGO membership every year ! Located within the old Grange mansion this exquisite café is by far the best place to retreat after visiting an exhibit here. The space offers a choice of sinking into beautiful modern Danish leather armchairs or sofas or pull up to an old fireplace with  ornate hearths and mantles. French doors lead out to a beautiful green area that can be viewed from most spots inside. The entrance is like a foyer in an old home complete with a grand staircase and flowers on a center table. Makes you feel like you are a guest in a private home. The menu is limited but exquisite and the service is friendly, yet formal. My favorites are the smoked salmon croissant ( with generous amounts of salmon!) and the delicate \"deconstructed\" Salad Nicoise. They also have pricey - but utterly wonderful - wine by the glass ( recently enjoyed a glass of white Rioja - at $13 a glass this is definitely \"a treat\"). I have also treated friends to lunch here and it is the perfect spot for a \"ladies\" get together ! The best butter tarts, too by the way !"

        "The Grange is a historic mansion built in the 1800s in downtown Toronto and is part of the Art Gallery of Obtario. In fact, it was the original Gallery and was home to a mayor of Toronto and MP. If you are at the AGO, make sure to visit this gorgeous, restored home that is also part of the Norma Ridley Lounge for Museum members - open for lunch every day. I enjoy coming here and sitting on one of the many plush leather chairs, overlooking Grange Park that stretches to Queen Street and Spadina. Or sitting by the hearth of a marble fireplace and having a coffee. The tour itself will bring you to the kitchen and the library- the upstairs is not available for visitors. We enjoyed the tour, but the best part is truly the lounge itself and being in such a beautiful house. The winding staircase and open foyer with stain glass, crown moulding and baseboards, oak hardwood and crystal chandeliers of an era gone by, all culminate in that feeling of being in a home as a guest. The lounge is licensed, so a nice glass of Canadian wine just adds to the experience. I've had the home made chips and dip, the trout and salad, quiche, and macaroni and cheese. Service is very good, and the quiet atmosphere and surroundings make it a better choice than the loud cafe. A beautiful home and hidden gem!"

The food was reasonable and tasty. My friend had a smoked salmon Benedict that she enjoyed (see picture) and I had a brisket dish that arrived attractively presented in a skillet. I also enjoyed an Aperol Spritz (refreshing) and my companion a glass of wine. Prices were reasonable and portions satisfactory. Seating is in low armchairs. Atmosphere is pleasant with art on the walls."

        "Having lunch in the Grange used to be a complete pleasure. I have always loved sitting at the clean tables in the room with light streaming in from the Grange park, and being able to gaze outside or admire the works of art on the walls. ",
        "Alas, this past Friday was the second visit in about 4 months where the pleasure was cut short. On Friday, in spite of the fact that it was relatively crowded, service was fine. The food, however, was not completely fine. There has never been a huge selection on the menu, which has never been an issue in the past. It used to be that there would be at least one sandwich, a salad, an egg dish and soup.  I like sandwiches... from the rather meager selection on Friday, I chose \"chicken club salad\", foolishly thinking it would be a reasonable facsimile of a club sandwich. The plate came 3/4 covered with large pieces of Romaine lettuce (crisp) that were smothered in nicely grated parmesan cheese. There was one long thin thin piece of toast, a couple of cherry tomato halves and in the other 1/4 of the plate, a mound of rather unpleasant looking chicken salad. The chicken was mostly dark meat (usually a plus in my books) was overcooked and had a dead taste. Instead of being mixed with mayonnaise, it was dressed in a sweetish salad dressing. As far as I could tell, there was zero bacon. It wasn't dreadful enough to send back but it was dreadful enough to be completely disappointed.",
        "My friend got the crab cakes with a salad. I tasted a bit of the crab cake that was decidedly fishy tasting. Again, it wasn't too fishy tasting to send back but fishy tasting enough to be disappointing.  ",

        "Having to pay $20 each for lunch was a bit much. If the kitchen were up to scratch, this would be completely reasonable. I would view it as supporting the Gallery.   ",
        "We cleansed our palates by going back into the AGO to feast our eyes on beautifully several beautifully presented rooms filled (but not overfilled) with fine artwork. ",

        "Granted, I'm not one of the older patrons, but we are AGO members but i feel they want a certain...kind of clientele, and with friends or spouse, we consistently get ignored now. ( I find the food in the cafeteria to be shockingly over priced and not all that good.)",

I liked it better when it was maintained as a historical site, but I can understand that the AGO wanted to put it to a different use. I try to have a coffee and some pastry here whenever I visit the AGO, and today was no exception. Having taken in the Turner exhibition, about to close, I escaped the crowds by going to the Grange. It is a peaceful oasis, and the apple crumble tart I had was delicious while the coffee was very good."

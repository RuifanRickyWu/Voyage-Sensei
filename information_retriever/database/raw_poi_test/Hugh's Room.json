  "description": "Hugh's Room is a concert hall recently relocated to 296 Broadview Avenue in the Riverdale / East Chinatown neighbourhood of Toronto. Our original home operated on Dundas Street West from 2001 until 2020. This new location opened in Sept of 2023 featuring live music from a variety of genres - primarily folk, jazz, global and other independent legacy and emerging artists in an intimate 200 seat concert setting. There is no longer a restaurant component to the venue. Live music is presented most nights Wednesday to Saturday with occasional Tuesday and Sunday (aft and evening) shows. Hugh's Room is a registered charitable cultural instituion.",

        "So happy to have found this great spot for live music in Toronto!  I used to go to the \"old\" Hughes Room but I like this new location much more.  The building was originally a church which means that the space is wide open and comfortable and the accoustics are excellent.  I prefer a smaller, more intimate venue and really enjoy catching live performances - something that has become harder to find in recent years - so this spot is a goldmine.  Lots of variety to the shows - different styles of music and different artists - which I really appreciate.  I also love that they provide a stage to local and well as international talent."

        "Yes the food isn’t the draw here, though I did have an enjoyable burger there last week. I got some tickets to see JV’s Boogaloo Squad and decided to treat some like minded friends. The band was great, the service good, the beer and burger satisfying and my wife and friends had a great time. It’s a great music venue, a registered charity and a mediocre restaurant. The tickets were cheap by most standards and very cheap considering we were 20 feet from the stage with an unobstructed view! I did make a donation as music venues are closing because they can’t turn a profit due to skyrocketing rents. Thanks dirty money. This is why they decided to become a non profit. This room has some amazing acts passing through, its intimate, the sound is great and they do it day after day. If you don’t like the food, eat before the show but get out and support live music, you won’t regret it. Love to Hugh’s Room Live! "

        "Last night we went with friends to listen to music ! It was tribute night for James Taylor! My favourite type of evening. The show started at 8:30 and they stagger the dinner so that they can feed everyone. We were there at 6 pm. We ordered and most of the food was good but the Cobb salad my friend and I ordered was disgusting! Mostly lettuce with a garlic aioli dressing that did not even go , a tiny piece of bacon a tsp of soggy crab meat from a frozen package and that was about it! I was offered something else but unfortunately due to my new lifestyle of eating Keto there was not much else I could get! I want them to fix this! There is no excuse for terrible food! Check online and see what is in a Cobb salad please! Don’t charge $17 for lettuce if you are not going to deliver please! Your venue delivers amazing music and I would love to return for many evenings! Please learn to make good food! "

Sent both back and went for the only dessert available and highly recommended by the server; chocolate coconut cake. When it arrived 30 minutes later it was so hard I had to use a knife to cut it.

        "I have been to Hugh's Room many times and always enjoyed the experience. It's a great music listening/watching venue and the food has always been good. Nothing too creative but good. Not any more. The only thing at our table of five that was yummy was the french fries. The \"picnic\" was a joke (tiny Charcuterie board with a few dry biscuits, slim amount of cheese and some meat). They ran out of both green salads (and we were there early) so served us some wilted kale. The wine is horribly overpriced and the service was so slow we gave up waiting after 15 minutes and ordered a bottle of wine directly at the bar. Our waiter was funny and nice but they truly does not make up for bad service. I love this place and would love to see it thrive. This will not happen with bad food, bad service and then the begging for money (it is now a non-profit) - not so cool. I might suggest a new menu, more servers and wine that is worth the inflated price. Keep up the awesome music!"

        "I went to see Alfie Zappacosta perform in September 2019. I had never seen him perform before, and I had no idea that he was SO funny. The music was fantastic - that voice, oh that voice! - but his comments during the show made a wonderful evening even better.  The size of the room makes the musical experience very intimate, which is normally a good thing. However, this evening, there was one woman in the audience who did her best to spoil the show for everyone with her antics: standing up (and being told more than once to sit down), waving her arms around, shouting at the stage. In fact, even Alfie looked at her, frowned and shook his head. But where was the management? I saw a staff member speak to her during the intermission, in the typical apologetic Canadian fashion. She should have been given a couple of warnings and then ejected. And the food. Hmmm. The burger was delicious, and for $21.00 it should be. Dessert - ONE choice. Passion fruit cheesecake. I saw one person order it - one person, in a room of 200. All the other reviews are correct. It's a wonderful venue for music lovers, but management needs to do a lot of work in the food service department. The prices are not cheap, but the quality of the food certainly is.",

I am going there tonight and I took a peek at the menu to see if it had changed - don't know why I bother to look and hope.  It seems to have gotten worse not better - at least under the other chef they had a few more selections. They continue to miss the opportunity to improve it. I see a lot of people book a table and just not eat. Tonight is Alfie Zappacosta - wouldn't even a few thematic additions to the menu make sense - match them to the type of music? Judging from the other reviews it seems that no one is listening. Anyone in there Hughs? Hellooooooooo.... All I can recommend to you is go for the music folks, and eat before you go."

Next was the tasteless and hard prosciutto (really? Could have fooled me ) ravioli which was totally uncooked and beyond ‘al dente. Then the sirloin and that made me realize we had not been asked how we wanted it cooked. This was over cooked and tough, but tasty nonetheless. Best shared dish was the ‘from the sea’ which was a mixed grill of calamari, shrimp and octopus with some sort of garlic, parsley marinade. Every dish was totally unadorned.

Our waiter was great and we all enjoyed our food choices.

Yup an inch long rolled up cigar bit the circumference of a cinnamon stick. Our waitress took it away and then avoided us for about 30 minutes. When she came back we had to ask her about the bit and she said “neither the chef nor the prep team smoke...well one quit a few weeks ago.” Then she asked for our main order. No apology, no nothing. My stomach was a bit turned and so we waited a while. Meanwhile the Opening ACT was the House Manager and she was  not great. In fact she was worse than not great. Eventually the headliner came on and he was super talented and very entertaining. Meanwhile we ordered a “safe” main with a recco from a regular patron. It was fine. Our bill came and there was the salad, including $14 worth of cigar.  My date complained to the bartender and the bill was adjusted. But no apology, nothing. We love Hugh’s Room.~it’s a neighbourhood and city institution. But shoddy service, lame opening acts (in a city brimming with talent) and CIGAR BITS in the food do not bode well for its future. We will go back, not for dinner and only after checking out the talent on SoundCloud or YouTube!"

The food before it closed was quite adequate and often delicious and suitably priced. The service has always been good. Since Hugh’s Rm has reopened, the food is a real disappointment. They have tried several approaches, small plates....nope! I was there last Sunday evening for a wonderful jazz night with Barbra Lica. We noted a new menu!  Wow!  I ordered the Cornish Hen and my friend ordered the sirloin. Her meat was siazable but came medium, not medium rare as ordered. The chicken arrived hot, crispy and delicious.....encouraging....BUT....the mashed potatoes were a cold and watery mass underneath the chicken and the Brussels sprouts had been passed over the steamer. Grrr! What is so difficult about providing simple, well prepared food for a reasonable price?  The food quality is beginning to discourage me from entering any further than a stool at the bar.....but hope rules!"

        "For musicians and music lovers alike, Hugh's Room Live is an excellent venue for catching some of the best live music in the city. Since the club reopened, the music programs continues to be excellent and there have been exemplary efforts made in improving the quality of the food program. Along with the beer, I had the burrata, seafood and a dessert. All were excellent. As a west-end native, I'm thrilled to have Hugh's Room open again. It's a gem every Torontonian should have in their pocket."

        "We try to get into Hugh's room several times a year with friends to enjoy an evening together. We were last here in March and loved every minute so we had been really looking forward to last night. The band was fantastic Monkey Junk were worth more than the ticket price, but the food was Absolutely Dreadful! Described to us as 'being like a tapas service' that we could share the food came out of the kitchen at random intervals, cold, uninteresting and tasteless. For heavens sake do not get the ravioli - it was delivered from the kitchen as three dry slabs of pasta with a teaspoon of filling in each. The chicken thighs were crammed into a side dish while the sweet potato fritters were piled on top of one another in the middle of a soup plate. I have no idea how we were meant to share any of it. And after tasting it no one would want to. They need to stop trying to be pretentious with the food and revert to serving simple dishes that are worth eating. Time for a visit from Restaurant makeover!!! And for heavens sake get the ladies toilets fixed!!!!"

        "Lots of bad reviews about the food and the menu. I found both to be just fine. The new menu is made up of small dishes that are meant to be shared around the table. Don't go expecting to have a giant dinner. However after several dishes I had eaten enough. Everything was tasty and served promptly. We drank a nice draft lager too.",
        "Its not super cheap but hey - its downtown Toronto - you want to find cheap see if your favorite band will play in Hamilton. That said it is not expensive either and our band ticket was $20 so it was not an expensive night.",
        "Anyhow you go to Hugh's room for the music and our show was fantastic. The Small Glories were excellent. Hugh's is small and intimate. A great spot to see any act."

        "We saw Jeff Daniels + Ben Daniels Band last night and what a great show! I could have listened to the music and stories for alot longer than the two hour show. Now for the food: it's a new menu since we were there in March and I think it's a big improvement. It's sharing plates that arrived in a timely fashion. We had the olives, croquettes, caprese salad, roasted veg and bacon (!) popcorn. Everything was very good but portions are small for the price. This was our dinner and it was more than enough for the 2 of us. The value for us is in enjoying great music with an appreciative, respectful audience. "

        "Hugh’s Room Live has a rich and important history in the Toronto music scene but unfortunately could not make a go of it and closed its doors a couple of years ago. Thankfully, a group of music lovers took it over and after heavy campaigning and fund raising, brought it back as a not for profit venue. I’m thankful for that. They have booked some wonderful acts over the months and I have attended my share of shows. ",
        "Having said that, they clearly need to bring someone in to revamp their food and beverage service. As this is primarily a dinner and music venue, you would think that they would offer a decent selection of food. But their menu choices are scant, their portions leave you feeling hungry and cheated and their prices way higher than their quality, and this has been going on since they reopened with seemingly no interest in changing and improving. ",
        "Case in point. Two weeks ago I ordered pork tenderloin. The portions of pork were ok but the taste was marginal. To accompany the pork they offered a tiny smattering of some sort of metallic tasting chutney and two halves of a tiny Parisian potato. That’s it. If I wasn’t so pissed off I would have found it laughable. The waiter was called over and to his credit, brought back two more potato halve a about eight green beans. But not after the meat was gone. However to their credit, my wife had their $21 burger and it was average. ",
        "The following week we went back to see Colin Linden. I thought I’d have the $21 burger but they were sold out. Really? How do you sell out a burger? The inmates are running the asylum. ",
        "Here’s the thing. If you want to see a show you pretty much have to book and prepay a table for dinner. That’s generally $30-50 per seat. However, their tables are mostly for 4 or more people and you have to book the full table. Too bad if you want to go out for a date night with just your special other. Further, you are assigned an exact time to show up which is 6:00 or 6:15 or 6:30 or 6:45. That’s very inconvenient if the show starts at 8:30 which they usually do. There’s very little flexibility with the times. I called last week to change my yin’s to 7:30 and was told that I could wait a long tine for my meal. I asked if that could be two hours and was told “maybe”. Really?",
        "The thing is that this situation has been going on since it reopened. A year ago, on two occasions, we went to shows and had awful meals. I don’t even remember this issue but it was enough to write them a very polite and well intentioned letter telling of my experience. I received no reply. So I wrote them again. Same reply. None. So I boycotted them for a year. I went back two weeks ago as a test and nothing had changed. ",
        "Bottom line. If you are keen to see the shows and you don’t mind sitting on a stool at the back or standing, go. They offer great entertainment and Toronto needs that. But if you go expecting to get a good meal for a high end restaurant price, be prepared to be totally disappointed."

        "My wife and I were over the moon regarding our Over The Rhine Experience. Wow is all I can say about the concert experience. We were first timers, and after reading the multiple negative reviews about the food we were really not too excited about that side of the event. We both attempted to order burgers believing that was the easiest to prepare successfully but alas they were \" out of burgers\" by the time we arrived (7 p.m.). As a \"plan b\", we both ordered the linguine it was great. Portions could have been larger, however, I am basically a swine that walks upright so I could say that about any dish that I liked at most restaurants. All in all, from this reviewer I hope you will not let what could be a musical dinner experience that has the potential to be as uplifting as ours was be missed because of old reviews. Thank You Hughs Room for a great experience!"

        "I'm very sad to write a negative review. I usually don't do it, if I'm unhappy with any experience, I just keep it to myself. However, this was truly bad Mother's Day Brunch! The 'Hugh's Room organized a Mother's Day Brunch with quite decent music by Tiki and few women singers, that was okay despite one of the singers (Lily Frost) bringing her kids to the stage - why? It was supposed to be a professional concert, not sing-along karaoke, eh ... Anyway, the kids were the least of the problem. The main issue is with the misleading tickets sale described as \"Mother's Day Brunch Concert\" $25.00 per person - that sounds OK, doesn't it? Well, at the end of the event, we've learnt that $25.00 was just for the Concert part, there was extra $25.00 for the Brunch part collected at the table. Very sneaky! Very misleading. The brunch itself was definitely not worth $25.00 - cold veggies, shredded pieces of cheese and overdone pancakes can hardly be worth that much! Never again! If one wants to have a good brunch with jazz, one should check Ricarda, or for the evening with jazz go to Smith Bar. Hugh's Room - NEVER AGAIN!"

        "Ok...so we know it is expensive to go there. But if you're going to put out $100 for a couple of people for the meal  alone the least you could do is offer decent desserts. I absolutely do not recommend the vegan chocolate cake it was tasteless and a waste of $8. I know people have been commenting on how wonderful the food has been since there's a new chef. But I found the Cornish game hen sauce so salty it ruined the meal I couldn't even taste the meat. Other people at the table had different entrees and they enjoyed it very much. So I'm hoping the food will continue to improve. If you order the Cornish game hen ask for no sauce or sauce on the side. I did not say anything about the sauce because I had been taken there as a guest and my meal was being paid for by a friend. Under those circumstances one usually does not choose to file any complaints at the time."

Wonderful places to eat \"The Goof\" in particular which is a Legendary Local spot to eat, with the Fox Theater right across the street.  Lots of individual shopping experiences unlike the huge Malls the Beach Village offers independent proprietors with unique items, check out Segull and the Artisans store, they were my favorites.  I miss my Village.  It holds a huge part of my heart forever.  "

The Beach strip along Queen just has too many restaurants now.

The area used to have more of a night life than it does now, and it is sad to see some fixtures of the area leave. Like the store ENDS, it was always a destination to see what kind of bargains you could get. Now, I usually go for an ice cream or a slice of pizza and a walk. It is also a very nice place at night to listen to the waves lapping the shore. Great place to watch people and dogs."

        "We’ve been many many places around the world and although this area is quaint and old, it’s not the place one would stay for any length of time. 30 percent of these poor souls live in basements as is the norm with these old houses. Homes are basically duplexes but with 3 levels on each side. If your tall, avoid the basements. The number of people somehow allowed to live in this type of housing explains the extremely limited parking. The public transportation is awesome very similar to Europe. Easy and cheap to get around. Get the PRESTO card since it’s good for trams, subways, buses, and has an app to reload money. There are several nice bars and restaurants, few shops worth going out of your way for, but the beach seems to be a huge draw for people. While we were here, there was an ecoli outbreak in some of the lake Toronto beaches which according to the locals is common. Not sure what there plan is but we’re avoiding getting into the lake. The beach has a great wooden walk way along side a bike/jogging trail. Very peaceful and safe. Parking for people visiting can be found in town. "

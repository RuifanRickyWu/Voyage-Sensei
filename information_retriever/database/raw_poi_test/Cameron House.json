        "The Cameron House is a staple of mine. I believe it would be classified as a dive bar (in a good way?) or a bit of a hipster joint, but certainly laid back and comfortable with an easy clientele. Some nights the bands are just ok, other times they are fantastic. WIth no cover, pay what you want / can when the band comes around with the jar, it's easy to drop in to see what kind of a night it is. Since the Horseshoe Tavern is also very close, you can do a bit of a music crawl. It does get busy though, so make an effort to arrive at a decent time. Don't expect anything fancy and come with an open mind - you may be very pleasantly surprised!"

Usually bands of this calibre come with a big ticket price They played country rock and were obviously very experienced musicians...what a treat! The lead singer, Lori Yates - huge voice was super friendly and funny and said they played there every week 8-10 on Tuesdays. We made sure to buy their cd to take home with us! The bar itself is dark and funky with a beautifully painted ceiling. Very down to earth and the bartender was  friendly. No food but there's lots of places around to grab something. You should go!"

They serve only drinks, at a very reasonable price, but let people bring in their own food if they want to eat dinner or a snack during the music or in the breaks between music. If you go to the website for ''Cameron House\" you can find the listing for the music sessions which occur 7 evenings a week, beginning at 6 pm.  Sometimes when I get inspired by the music we will get up and dance in the space they have available in front of the band. It can be a relaxing and enjoyable evening and can introduce you to musicians you may not have heard before."

The back room is a 60-seat cabaret venue, and there is usually a small cover charge, depending on the attraction - usually about $10.00. Some of Canada's very best musicians learned their craft ast the Cameron"

It's a quirky old, small bar with a front and back room, both of which have shows at night (not open before 4 pm).  Friendly atmosphere;  loved the Boneshaker on draft at the bar.   Couldn't hear a pin drop from the adoring crowd:  Emma-Lee was fantastic! No cover, but she did ask for donations, and that was a chance to meet her.   After all of the fun, though, silly me, I dropped my wallet and the bartender kept it safe for me:  what excellent service;  so very appreciated as the cost of replacing all of my ID, and the cash lost, it would have been a disaster!   Thank you Cameron, for a great evening, and for saving me from myself:  we'll be sure to come again!"

Despite my mild, friendly manner he claimed to take offence at something and started the shouting which never stopped. The other employee joined in the shouting and said here’s an insult:“you’re old.” And gave me the finger. ",

Vegetable and fruits are priced higher that McEwen, Pusateri and the like. Big choice of chocolates, some I have seen I. Europe but check the expiry dates. The bakery, pricey for each piece like the cruffin, bomba, biscotti, Nutella doughnuts and cannoli are not all fresh, you have to ask them if it is and they take their time answering you. The  sfogliatella definitely was days old with the ricotta really smelly...pricey but they should not sell day old or 2 days cannoli i definitely was not fresh also. Had the sandwich which was average.  This is the second time I came for pastries, nothing special by the way.",

        "I am a cheese lover and often go to special cheese stores to get high quality cheese with excellent variety.  The service by number was fast and the employee realizing I knew a thing or two of cheese told another employee he will be longer so we wouldn't feel rushed.  He took the time to really get into cheeses we may like.  I only walked out with $150 worth as we were with others and had to leave but amazing place.  I think Ben Affleck has forgotten his cheese hanging in the cheese vault.  You must visit the cheese vault while there.  Oh and they have these donuts filled with heaven. No other way to describe them, freshly made at the front.  Stop and grab 6."

The prices for me however were mind-blowing.  I didn't leave empty handed however.  A half pound of cheese, a box of crackers, 100g of Spanish olives and one cupcake set me back $23.  I don't envision returning here anytime soon."

Bought a couple of cheeses to take home (to U.K.!), lunch for 3 of us (2 Deli sandwiches & Mac Cheese - delicious!) plus amazing desserts. It wasn't cheap but it was absolutely gorgeous. "

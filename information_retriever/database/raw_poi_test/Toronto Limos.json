  "description": "Situated astride Lake Ontario, Scarborough is a district heavily influenced by immigration. With a number of low-rent shopping and dining options making it a highly affordable part of town, and boasting one of Toronto's largest shopping malls, the otherwise green suburban neighborhood is a good place to go for bargains and discounts. It also draws in photographers. The spires, archways, and cavernous rooms of the BAPS Shri Swaminarayan Mandir Palace are filled with breathtaking art, architecture, and detailed reliefs – it’s like entering a different world, The ruins of columns and installation art at the Guild Inn makes a free-for-all exploration site, while the big-name draw for young photographers is the menagerie at the Toronto Zoo. While many visitors shirk Scarborough as too suburban, its houses are some of Toronto's most mystical and haunting architectural beauties. And for adventure lovers, it has river-rafting and some unique hiking trails.",

The limo arrived 45 minutes late to pick us up and I had to guide them over the phone for a half an hour on how to get to my house. I live on a major highway. I have been in contact with them regarding some type of compensation for this, but not receiving any response. When we were picked up at the airport, it was supposed to be a black limousine and they sent a white one. Not the biggest deal but still not what we ordered.  If I hear back from this company, I will update my review."

        "We set up a limo ride to Niagara for my brothers 40th birthday. They Provided a limo driver who does not speak English, did not know how to use any basic functions in the car and how to use GPS. This nightmare started instantly taking back roads from the city to the highway. During the ride he got off the highway twice and started driving on city streets in circles, only until after our group guided him back to the highway did we start heading to the winery. Our group of ten with senior citizens were worried for our safety. We had stopped the party and spent the next hour and a half on edge to make sure he did not make anymore mistakes. We Helped guide him with our own phones to get us to the destination which we arrived 45 mins late. On the way back it started pouring rain and we were in panic because he did not know how to use the wipers going 100 km. I called customer service three times with no help, tried to get a hold of the management who did nothing. Spoke to the owner and he kept telling me “this is impossible, my drivers drives buses” did not care about our experience, we spent $1500 and he did not give us a penny back. Car also looks like nothing like the picture! straight out of the 80, rusty and beat up, but that’s not why we are very frustrated, unprofessional driver, put us in extreme danger and panic for 1 hour and 45 mins and company not taking any responsibility for this nightmare.

        "My best friends wedding this limo shows up late (25 mins - no call for an update), therefore groom/groomsmen took an Uber, leaving the limo for bride/bridesmaids. Once arrived, driver sat in the front seat on his cellphone. Didn’t acknowledge us, didn’t even open to door for the bride and her party. DISGUSTING. We pile inside when the driver tells us we won’t be moving until the bill is “settled”. This had already been taken care of PRIOR to her wedding day! Driver continues to try to get more money, while us, the bridal party scream at him to move the limo - had 15 mins to get to venue at this point! He FINALLY starts moving and then we realize the inside of this vehicle. Picture this.. no AC, duct tape on the passenger door, warm bottle of champagne, stains from previous spills, and our seat was completely broken! We arrive at venue - we think the worst is over - nope! ",

Long story short the owner (who proceeded to scream at the party over the phone) was not getting more money. We then contacted our AMAZING hotel manager in a panic who then helped us set up with 2 Uber’s and got all 12 of us back safe! ",

We had ordered two SUV limos for our wedding day, the groomsman entered their limo first and noticed the air conditioning was not working, which was extremely frustrating as it was a hot day to begin with and they are all wearing suits. Then the driver advised them that the second limo driver didn't know where to go so he was going to wait for her...which was not the plan. The guys had to leave first, he made them wait an extra 15mins, and now we are behind scheduled. ",
        "I entered our limo, and noticed immediately how hot the limo was. She had the car waiting, but did not turn on the A/C either. We asked her to turn it on and she said it is on. HEAT was blasting from the vents, blasting. The driver did not care at all about our current condition and she that's all she could do. We then asked if the radio could be turn on, and that didn't work. She then proceeding to tell us that she didn't know where to go, and we had to use our own GPS to guide her the way. I am approx 30mins from my wedding, in a heated vehicle, with a sick mother, directing the driver where to go. I was not celebrating my soon to be wedding as I should have been, this drive should have been easy, fun and cool. The driver then proceeded to make a wrong turn, which then made me 15mins late for my own wedding. This was literally the most stressful part of the day, when it should have been the easiest. The driver did not have a care in the world that we were running late, dying of heat or that the radio did not work. You would think the limos would have to have specific checks before leaving the property?? ",
        "This experience was absolutely horrible. I sent the company five emails explaining the day and requested a refund. Did not receive an email back. Finally called them, they said they never received any of my emails. They offered me a $200 credit... I paid $1,400 for a service that was not provided. I did not want a credit, I would never use them again! I said no I want my money back, the gentleman on the phone told me he would have to pay for the A/C to be fixed... not my problem... then told me I wouldn't get a penny back and then advised me to never call them again.

Everything else was great.  Driver was great and on time.  Really nice guy.  We were told on Tuesday that the air was working before it left to get us.  Well it didn't work at all when we got it.  The driver acknowledged that and even sent a message to the company.  We sent emailed and texts ahead of time.   We even got written acknowledgement from the driver.   We asked for 10 percent  adjustment in compensation  and they took the stand that it was working before it left.  It's not on their contract that it includes AC so if you hire them insist that it is worded in so you can seek compensation on \"not as described service\"  with your credit card company if you get one without working air.

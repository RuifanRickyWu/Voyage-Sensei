  "description": "The Young Centre for the Performing Arts was envisioned by George Brown College and Soulpepper Theatre Company to be a home to Toronto's arts community and a destination for all theatre lovers. Anchored by the presence of Soulpepper's year-round repertory season and George Brown College's Theatre School, the Young Centre provides a home for both the leading artists of today, as well as the arts leaders of tomorrow. When you step through the doors of the Young Centre you can feel a difference. The space is alive with discussion and debate. There is a kinetic energy fueled by the passion of performers, students, and audiences. There is a musical hum to designers, choreographers, directors and musicians collaborating. There is a rhythm set by the theatre, dance, music and poetry that fills each of the spaces. This is the environment in which we get to work, play, create and share. And you belong here.",

        "I have visited my fair share of theaters in Toronto and I have to say this was the worse customer service experience yet.  A large group of friends attended this theater for a show for a friends birthday, now this theater has a no entry once the show has started rule but since the show was only an hour long they stated they would make an exception.  I arrived with 2 other friends at 8:12pm after having a very difficult time finding this place for an 8pm show.  Upon arrival there were about 12 people waiting to be allowed in to their seats.  We were given the message that because the show has started we had to wait; we could not enter and disturb the performers but could watch the show on a very small TV hanging on the wall outside the entrance door.  A man came out and took 5 girls into the show and sat them in the very front row (we could see this on the TV), then came back out and shared some whispers with the lady that asked us to stand outside. Several minutes later, several whispers from the staff, and several sighs from the upset waiting guests we were told (only after being asked what the hold up was) that because the show has started and although we all have tickets with specific seats we could not sit in them because if there were in the middle of a row that would disturb the show.  They were moving people around and removing others (who I am assuming were staff or friends of staff or just non paying guests) that filled the empty seats and trying to locate seats for all.  We were told to stand in this really dark small almost sound proof room and wait for directions as to what to do next.  Now not only can we not see the show but we also cannot hear the show.  Several guests as well as myself became upset and we were giving the message to either wait in here, stand at the back of the show and not make any noise but if we were heard talking we had to leave or go back outside and watch from the small TV.  When questioned on how come it was ok to seat guests in the very front row without any issue but not able to seat us we were given the same message as to where to wait but now added was a you can choose to leave and not watch the show, without receiving a refund! ",
        "It was not until 8:28pm that me and my 2 friends were finally seats (in seats that were not ours I must add).  This situation could have been better dealt with, do not give the message that we cannot be seated due to the location of our seats when you seat people in the front row minutes before without issue, then later say that they are removing/moving people to allow us seats.  All of this is just as or possibly even more disturbing then if you would have just allowed those there to watch the show get to the seats quickly and quietly.  Due to this whereas I would have only missed 15 minutes of the show I now missed half!  Not happy at all!!",
        "Also a word of advice to women,be very careful when wearing heels as the ground is laid with all uneven stone (bricks), although this gives the overall look great appeal is is quite difficult to walk and I almost tripped a few times making the walk to the theater."

        "We've been going to Soulpepper Theatre for years, so we've have had ample reason to appreciate its acting spaces. If there are bad seats, I haven't sat in them. The food on offer is very good: a bowl of soup and a sandwich or wrap make for a fine start to the evening. Most important, the productions are uniformly very good to excellent. During the past two week we have seen Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead and, most recently, Spent. The latter was very good fun, the former is an absolutely \"most see\" show, so I'm taking our son there tomorrow. Soulpepper has assembled a stellar group of regulars whose performances make one glad to be living in Toronto. If I have a favorite it is Diego Matamoros, but there are so many others who are excellent that it seems almost unfair to name them, lest I slight the ones I don't. Let me simply say that Ted Dykstra, Jordan Pettle, and Kenneth Welsh are superb as the principals in R and G. For visitors to Toronto this should definitely be part of the agenda."

The order process was easy and quick and there is no worry about losing tickets in the mail as they are not sent out, you simply pick them up  at the venure before the show. The venue is intimate without being too tiny, the service from everyone from the people at the door to the ticket desk, the bar and the ushers was absolutely impressive. Where do they find this many nice people?!? The location is very easy to find (I came from 150 kilometers south-west of Toronto) and parking was also easy to find. The distillery district where the theatre is located is a fun place with lots of ambience, art galleries, restaurants and boutiques. The next show I go to I will be leaving at least three hours early so I can visit the shops and have dinner in one of the nearby restaurants. "

        "We went to see Twelve Angry Men at Soulpepper in the Young Centre. I thought it was a great play  the first time I saw it, many years ago - but this is a better and stronger performance altogether. Drama can be everywhere, of course, but sometimes the best of stories focus on a singular place and time, like a ship at sea, a castle under siege, a space station or a room in which a jury deliberates. It is not an easy process to co-ordinate and hone the skills of 13 very competent actors on one small stage; but the director has found the balance between outrage and deliberation as the memory of facts becomes deconstructed, examined and re-constructed a number of times. It is a very human play where the best of motives can eventually overcome the worst - unlike the less savoury outcome so often evident in the real world. The movie that features Henry Fonda is a good iteration of this play; but the Soulpepper production is better and more immediate, in a way that live theatre can lift us and carry us in its slipstream.",
        "The Young Theatre Centre is a fine specimen of the restoration/renovation genre, where former exterior walls are magically recombined with the help of steel, wood and glass into new and exciting structures that have new purpose, whilst still referencing the historical use of the space. The seating is well appointed in the theatre, but there is also lots of other space to explore in the foyer, where food and rinks are available and which many patrons are enjoying. Certainly a night to remember, as was also the tab for parking - which at $16 to cover the period for a meal and the theatre is excessive, right up there with hospital parking costs (that the government is thinking of regulating because they are excessive). Perhaps a better (and greener) approach would be to take public transit, although in that case, the return journey on a cold night might take a while."

This  meant a section of about 6 seats were out of alignment and cut our leg room in half! Such a silly thing but it was too late to do anything about it and we had to suffer.

We were in the Baillie Theatre. Rows D – G are mid-section to the stage and make for a great view of the stage but since the theatre is cozy all seats are really good. The group sang, played multiple instruments & acted continually for over 90 minutes. Their voices filled the theatre and the music was warm and exciting to your body and soul. It’s a light & satirical twist on life after death and how the characters lived their lives before their death.  The outstanding part of their acting was each cast member played more than one part. Each with a new accent sometimes and a very different story of what their life was like before ending up in the Spoon River Cemetery.  It ends with a reminder of how we should live our lives. After losing my husband to cancer 4 years ago, it may be wonder what funny things he would say if I could hear him speak about our lives on earth.  It truly was the best play I have ever seen in my lifetime and I have seen a lot of them. If you missed it in Toronto, It will be worth the trip to New York City to see it there starting July 2017. -You know its great when NYC takes it on. See it at Soulpepper on 42nd St."

You can't help but feel part of the action here and they go out of their way to create entertainment events that bring you among the best stage performances that Toronto has to offer. ",
        "No pretence here - just good fun, good vibes and bar drinks that you can take to your seat. Very civilized indeed. "

        "The production of The Last Wife at Soulpepper Theatre is first rate.  Written by Kate Hennings, it is the story of Katherine Parr, last wife of Henry V111,a feminist, who acts as regent in Henry's absence and oversees the education of his children.  Done in modern dress, it is very effective in portraying the character of these historical figures.  Soulpepper is a great asset to the theatre world in Toronto, with excellent productions.  The theatre is small with good sight lines and intimate viewing.  Their restaurant serves a variety of light snacks, which can be enjoyed with a glass of wine.  We are looking forward to seeing more plays there."

I honestly can't say enough about how good this performance was, it's a MUST see, Soulpepper should really bring it back!  Thank you, so much, for such an excellent piece of entertainment."

The seating became somewhat uncomfortable after about an hour, but not horrible.   There is a bar in the lobby, and everyone we talked to was very friendly. "

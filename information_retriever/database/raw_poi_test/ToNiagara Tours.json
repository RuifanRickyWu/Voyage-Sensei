        "The activities were great (especially the Hornblower boat, which we really enjoyed), however, the transportation aspect left a lot to be desired. We received an email the day before explaining there would be only 2 pickups, however, there were actually 4 pickups that day all over town, including the airport. The trip there took over ~3.5 hours, when it would've been ~1.5 hours had we gone there ourselves. I thought the seating was really cramped and uncomfortable, more so than an economy flight. There was also no seating arrangement enforced, we were first to be picked up and sat on the first row (only fair, since we waited the longest), only to have it taken over by a couple who moved our stuff. Overall, I recommend going on your own, or choosing a tour with fixed stops."

Prior to the tour we had great communication from Nick about some specifics of the tour. Steve, our guide, was great and gave us a good balance of tour guide and to be left to our own devices. We had been considering hiring a car ourselves from Toronto but after witnessing the Toronto traffic we were so pleased to have Steve at the helm! ",
        "We highly recommend adding on the walk behind the falls and the dinner option at Skylon Tower, both amazing. At the end of our dinner Steve had the car waiting for us at the entrance ready to take us home. A full day and we thoroughly enjoyed it, and would highly recommend this tour."

After which we were free to visit the entertainment district.  After we were picked up, we stopped at some of the nearby attractions leading to the wine tasting where we partook in 4 types of wine.",

        "Just like the name suggests, the ToNiagara tour is a great tour that takes you to the Niagara Falls. It includes your ticket entrance to the Hornblower cruise (the boat that takes you to the falls), a 10 min. stop at the Whirlpool Aero Car, a ten min. stop at the Floral Clock and a wine tasting. Just like in any other tour, you only have a limited time in each place. Once you get to the Niagara Parkway, they take you directly to the Hornblower. After the cruise they give you two hours of free time, barely enough to get lunch and take a quick walk through the area, where there is so much to do that you will be disappointed you don't have enough time to see it all. For the next stops you are only ten minutes in each, which I think that was enough, and the wine tasting is about 30 minutes. Please be advised, they say the wine tasting is included but it only includes the white and red wine tasting, if you want to try the ice wine (which you should because that's their specialty and its delicious!), they ask for a \"donation\" of 2 CAD for the white ice wine and 4 CAD for the red ice wine. ",
        "What I loved the most about the tour is that they pick you and drop you off at the hotel, which is the main reason why we chose this tour. The highlight of the tour is definitely the Falls/Hornblower cruise. I would have loved more free time on the Niagara falls area. Apart from the wine tasting, I would have rather skip the stops at the Whirlpool Aero Car and Floral Clock and just have more free time at the Falls. ",

        "We were collected from Starbucks outside the CN Tower as arranged and the pick up was on time. We did not have a tour guide only a nice lady driver who was as helpful as she could be given she did not have any support. The journey to Niagra was fine save for the hard breaking, tailgating and shocking suspension (or lack thereof) on the bus. Additionally, we could not hear the basic directions given as the speaker system is non existent. The worst part was the lack of air conditioning. We asked but were told that it took time to get the air con going. It eventually kicked in when my partner swapped seats so she was sat in the aisle around 5pm. ",
        "Back to the tour, Niagra is a must see. That goes without saying. The real selling point is Niagra. I can’t imagine people are booking this tour for the clock or some wine. The trip to Niagra was a whistle stop tour and only made up a minute fraction of our day. We had no time to take it in after the Hornblower. Off to lunch at the Sheraton we went. The views are spectacular and the food was pretty good. We had a small buffet with fish (very good), roast beef (very nice), chicken (bit dry), rice, steamed veg and various cold salads. Drinks were not included except for water, tea and coffee. Dessert was good too, more options than mains. We had about 50mins took great pictures and then dashed to the bus for our 1pm drive to the helicopter for those who opted in. Not sure where everyone else went.",
        "We went on the helicopter which was fantastic. It provided incredible views and had a pre recorded in flight talk about the falls. The flight lasted 10mins or so. 6 passengers per flight. We were in a helicopter with four others and sat in the back. Two people get to sit up front. I would recommend trying to sit in the front if possible but the back seats provided good views too. The staff at the helipad took photos before the trip and just as I’ve now read from other reviewers, the photos are of the group of 6, which was not something we were interested in. They did take additional photos of each couple/group separately once sat in the helicopter. This was nice but $30CAD for a picture seems steep. I should add, they had 3 helicopters in rotation and so the wait was not too bad. Seemed like a well oiled machine. ",
        "Next up was the clock, floral clock to be exact. What an absolute waste of time. This added nothing to our excursion. We did not hear any information about how this related to... well, anything really. I should add that our tour was not narrated, and if it was, thanks to the sound system we wouldn’t have heard it. I’d like to think the driver/tour guide was focused on driving and so I would not begrudge her this considering she was on her own. ",
        "Next, off to the fruit and veg stall and small chapel that fits 6. Not sure it’s the smallest in the world, a quick google search suggests this may not be the case. The fruit and veg on offer was great. Not sure if it was organic etc but it tasted good and looked great. I thought it was overpriced but was happy to support local business. The chapel was essentially a shack. Cute but honestly I wouldn’t have missed it if we didn’t go there. Not sure it had much age or that it’s used, although it did have a power supply. ",
        "Finally on to the vineyard. I’ll keep this short. Two sips, one red, one white of the cheapest wine on offer. The “tour” was not a tour. In fact you have to pay $5 for an actual tour but of course we wouldn’t have had enough time. Our stops at each destination were roughly 10-25 mins (apart from the helicopter). You had to pay for a sip of the more expensive ice wine ($2 for white and $4 for red). The reason being that it takes 12 bottles to make the white and 20 to make the red. I should add that if you buy a bottle of ice wine then your $2/$4 is offset against the price of the bottle. We especially enjoyed that it was cooler in there than on our bus. ",
        "One final point, in case the tour operator reads this, we thought the little town of Niagra on the Lake was so very beautiful and quaint that we would have preferred a trip that split our time between the falls and that town where we could have gone through the lanes and stopped for some lunch away from the Vegas style strip in Niagra. The clock and vineyard are quite frankly forgettable."

        "I took this trip yesterday with a friend of mine. The pick up arrived on time and then the tour headed to Niagara Falls. My main problem with this trip was the really poor quality coach that we travelled in. The suspension was completely gone so we were thrown around all over the place every time we hit a bump, which is often on the Toronto roads. It was extremely uncomfortable. After we went on the boat trip at the falls we had to rush to meet at the designated pick up point. It was a shame as the falls are the main reason people take this trip. We had to rush down lunch and didn’t really have time to do much gift shopping. We then carried on to look at various attractions such as the whirlpool, the floral clock and a small chapel. All of which were quite nice but took a lot of time. By the time we were back on the road to Toronto we hit rush hour which doubled the travel time back Toronto to 3 HOURS! As the coach was so old and poor quality it felt like an eternity. It was an awful trip back and a real downer on the whole day. ToNiagara need to invest in some decent vehicles and rethink their timings to avoid such a bad journey back. The tour guide was very nice nice although a little hard to understand at times."

At one point, while driving at speed, he rolled down the window and spat his gum out and asked us moody and odd questions like \"so did you drink a lot at the vineyard then?\" Which we didn't at all given we were with our teenagers and are a boring old family. He seemed very unhappy and we were trying to be upbeat by asking about some of the things we passed and he just shrugged. Eventually he just sat in silence (turned the radio off too). It was awkward...! Hours later when we got back (bad traffic), he dropped us off in relative silence and muttered bye and sped off. We stood outside the hotel looking at each other and all said 'what was that about?!\" It was surreal how he went from the most sweet, helpful guide to being really unhappy- it wasn't us, we are nice! ",
        "This did not impact on our lovely day as a family but it was kinda strange. To be honest, we were having such a nice holiday that I didn't complain to the company and didn't feel the need to anyway.",
        "I think this company is awesome. I hope they are providing good training to the guides/ drivers and are truly focused on customer service and that is my only recommendation.",
        "I would recommend them to anyone as we did have a lovely day (except the last 2 hours) and the communication we had before was super helpful. :-)"

We enjoyed the falls at day and then at night.  Fireworks only lasted 5 minutes, but still a fun experience.  Our driver was nice, but looked at his cell phone far too much and for silly reasons like looking at photos.  Not safe or appropriate but still worth 4 stars."

        "My only really complaint was the shuttle bus. I realize the roads at times were not of the best condition but the bus needs new shocks, I don’t know if the bus even had shocks and felt like I’d been on a longer than desired jackhammer job. There was also horrible whistling through the windows. The company needs to consider that we paid over $200 per person and the ride should be much more comfortable. I can’t imagine being elderly! ",
        "It was nice to have someone else drive us, we were able to sit back and enjoy the beautiful fall leaves and the other pretty sights. The winery was great, too short of a visit to look around but the wine sommelier was good and entertaining. ",
        "The first stop before the falls took us to an absolutely stunning vista where cable cars traveled over the water. Again, the fall colors were exquisite. ",
        "Once at the falls, we had about four hours to go on boat ride, then look around while then finding dinner. I was surprised at the activity in the town, a bit more carnival atmosphere than I’d ever imagined while contrasting with the beauty and awe of the falls. I suppose that’s to keep the kids entertained. The Ferris wheel was a beautiful sight, it lasted much longer than we expected. ",
        "In closing, I’d do the tour again but I’d request a newer or upgraded vehicle."

        "I booked this tour because they offered airport hotel pick-up and I booked online about 4 days before the day of the trip. Pre-trip email communication was very good and we were picked up by the bus as arranged at our hotel in Airport Drive, Mississagua at about 07.30. After another airport hotel pick-up, we were then taken back to Toronto, in the rush-hour, to make 2 further pick-ups. A further stop was made on the way to Niagara, at Mississagua, about 09:45 and we reached Niagara Falls at about 11:15. (We'd been in the bus for nearly 4 hours already!)",
        "First up was the Hornblower boat ride, which was excellent,  It was well organised and quite exciting to be taken close up to the Horseshoe falls.  There was time then to get some lunch and have a walk along the well-maintained gardens towards the Horseshoe Falls. At 2 pm, we left Niagara Falls, in the bus, for short visits to the Whirlpool, the Floral Clock and the so-called World's smallest Chapel.  These were 10 minute stops which was just about enough tbh.",
        "The last stop was at a winery, which I quite enjoyed, and we got to taste some local wine and, at a small charge, some ice-wine - nice!",
        "We left the winery, in the bus, just after 4 pm and drove at speed back towards Toronto and made the first drop-off in Mississagua at about 5:30pm. This was about 15mins from the airport hotels where we'd started, but instead of going to the airport to drop us, we then had to endure another 2 hour rush-hour trip into Toronto and then back to the airport, finally dropping-off us and the other airport group at about 7.15pm, nearly 12 hours after being picked up.",
        "The driver/guide, Steve, was friendly enough and fond of the hyperbole, but I couldn't understand why we couldn't have been dropped off at the airport on the way back before going into Toronto.",
        "I'm only saying all this to suggest that if you're at the airport, then check on the pick-up/drop-off schedule, as you may find yourself spending hours on the bus.",
        "Lastly, and I'm not making any connections, but I put my credit card details into the online booking system (the only time I ordered online on our Canada trip) and a couple of days later, my card details were used for an (attempted) fraudulent transaction."

        "Everything started well with the pick up at our hotel location. Communication was smooth between their staff (Nick) and myself over email on the details prior to this. So far so good.",
        "Alas, that was when problems started to surface. After all passengers were picked up, we headed for Niagara. The A/C in the bus stopped working completely. It started to get extremely warm, stuffy and uncomfortable. Mind you, the windows in the bus cannot be opened. There is no ventilation, fan or wind. The A/C in the driver's seat was still functional. For the rest of us in the bus, it was the beginning of a long, uncomfortable and painful trip. ",
        "No one flagged this issue because we thought the driver turned off the A/C. After 4 hours of our own time at Niagara, it was time to head back. The A/C remained spoilt, and that is when I realised it was going to remain that way. I emailed customer support to ask for something to be done. They could not open the windows because the glass windows were not built to be opened (only for air conditioning). Someone said they will send a mechanic ( did not see one). It felt so great to finally arrive at our destination, because the bus was a real torture to be in.",
        "I emailed customer support to ask for some form of compensation at the end of the trip. I believe it is fair to refund customers something for a service they could not deliver. After a lengthy wait (6 working days), I received a email saying a damaged A/C is not liable for any form of refund. I only requested a portion of compensation out of goodwill, not the entire fee paid. Because I paid for a proper service and they could not deliver it and thought that was fair to get something back.",
        "Sometimes, accidents happen beyond's one control. It is the service recovery that comes into play and it it fell way flat here. We only received apologies from the driver and the correspondent in the email, but it felt like it was just lip service. Words are cheap, but my money isn't.",
        "Do not trust the reviews on their website. It only had 5 star reviews which was rather misleading. That is why I am sharing my experiences here.",
        "It is unfortunate because on another day, the A/C would have worked fine and this would be a decent tour. Just hope you get lucky that the A/C works and you get your money's worth, because I'm still charging you in full even though I messed up. That's the opinion I get from this company. To conclude, spend your money elsewhere."

Enthusiastic tour guide, gave us lots of information on the way down, allowed us to pick and choose if we wanted to stop at various attractions. Went on the Aero Car, did the wine tasting, and got great directions for the Hornblower and dinner at the Sheraton. The drive back in the dark scared my wife. At times he was doing 140 kph on the highway."

But based on the company's first-to-pick-first-to-drop system, these guests ended up making a big detour into the rush hour of Toronto City before being dropped back out of town. It would make more sense to drop them first then go into the city. Think the company needs to be more flexible about this."

        "I want to start by saying we are prior and future customers of ghostwalks.  This is our 3rd outing with the company and we have always enjoyed them.  This particular jaunt I wanted to rate 3 stars but didn't have the heart to do it since usually they are quite good.  I don't think the problem is really the company or the host William who was excellent all things considered.  Rather, I don't feel the Toronto venue lends to a great experience.  We only attended a few (3 or 4) buildings that had actual ghost stories, perhaps Toronto doesn't have many ghosts.  But I think the real problem is that Toronto is simply too bright, active, loud and busy to lend to the mood required for ghost walks to work well.  There needs to be a natural eery feeling in the air to truly enjoy a ghostwalk and frankly Toronto doesn't have that.  Since no one ever actually sees anything scary during these walks, it's really important for the environment to set the mood.  So thumbs sideways on this one, but looking forward to some Hamilton ones with ghostwalks next year."

We lost almost half the group once we left the church area. I am not sure if it was because they couldn’t keep up or because the tour wasn’t what they expected. The information was good, though his presentation was very dry. Since the cost is minimal it is worth the time. However, I have been through three other ghost walks that I have paid a lot more for, and would do so again before taking this one. The customer service, however is exceptional.  Unfortunately, The highlight of the tour was seeing the raccoon at the church. "

However, if fell down from there. The subsequent stories were short with a key lack of historical perspective and background. The tour guide didn't appear to know much about the back stories or even the city's history, or never relayed. It advertised as 80 to 90 minutes and we only got about 60. It seemed rushed and simply relayed. Many companies do a better job of training and hiring staff who are genuinely interested in the subject matter, not sure that was the case here. Other tour operators do a better job."

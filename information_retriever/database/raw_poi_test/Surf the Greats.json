        "Surf the greats is seriously THE BEST!! I first tried surfing in Maui when I was 14 (now 23) fell in love with it and knew that it was a feeling I would be chasing after for the rest of my life. Coming home it felt like something was missing and I was constantly googling places to surf in Canada/Ontario. I tried to get into the Toronto surf scene but was intimidated and not sure how to go about it so just settled for surfing on vacation maybe once a year if I was lucky. ",
        "Last year I came across surf the greats on instagram and it changed my life, seriously. I dragged my boyfriend with me to the shop because again I was intimidated to try to get into great lake surfing again but Antonio and everyone at surf the greats are so welcoming and just want to share the stoke with everyone that is passionate about surfing, regardless of skill or experience. I took a surf lesson with them at Woodbine beach in August and it was unreal and I knew then that lake surfing was going to be a part of my life. Since then I’ve rented boards from STG for some great lakes waves and attended She Shreds – yoga, beach clean-up, intro to surfing and wave-forecasting. All were great but my all time favourite was wave-forecasting. Antonio took the time to explain in depth how to predict where and when there are going to be waves which is such a key thing to be able to do, especially on the lakes. I left feeling like I truly have a way better understanding of how to know where and when to go out and try to get some waves! On top of that, She Shreds was an amazing way to meet other like minded women who love the water and surfing, and live in the city. If you are looking to get into great lake surfing, Surf the Greats is the way to go. They will help you be confident and safe, and most importantly have an absolute blast. ",

        "Great place to go get hyped on surfing. They are building a great surf culture here for everyone. I have had great experiences here from movie nights to increasing my Great Lakes board quiver. Went in looking for one type of board but with some experienced advice from the staff left with a different board and so thankful for it. Can’t wait to check out the new shop. ",

        "Surf the Greats has been part of my life for nearly two years, and I honestly don’t know where I’d be without this supportive, driven and welcoming organization. I first learned about Surf the Greats through a Google search, and attended one of Antonio’s wave forecasting workshops in January 2017. After the workshop, I felt motivated, excited and passionate about being part of the Surf the Greats community. I went on my first surf/yoga retreat to Nosara, Costa Rica in October 2017 and it was honestly one of the best experiences of my life. Looking back now, I didn’t realize how important this trip was in the context of my own life direction, but I came back to Canada with a clear mind, new goals, and support from an incredible surf community. Antonio, Matty and Aaron made sure that learning to surf wasn’t just about being able to stand up on a board. It’s about learning to be a considerate surfer, safety, mindfulness and focus. It’s so applicable to other parts of life, and I knew as soon as I got back that I wanted to go on another trip. I went to Chicama, Peru in March 2018, where I spent my 30th birthday refining skills, building confidence, and challenging myself. I always feel so safe out in the water with the instructors. They were always there to challenge me, but always had my safety in mind. The trip was unforgettable, and I’m so thankful for that experience. ",
        "Back in Toronto, you’d usually find me at the Surf the Greats shop. My work schedule is pretty flexible, so I could easy set up a remote office at the Surf the Greats coffee shop, where I was able to meet friends, help with events, watch the World Surf League competitions on TV, and plan the next surf adventure. Alex and Antonio both encouraged me to take the next step and try Great Lakes surfing, and before I knew it I was out on Lake Ontario in the middle of winter with them. Every experience has meant so much to me, I’m truly grateful to be part of this community. ",
        "I recently moved to London, UK and I can honestly say that leaving Surf the Greats has been the hardest part of the move. Even though I’m far away, it’s been amazing to watch all of the exciting things happening in the STG community – from a new shop space, board shaping facility, SUP classes, exciting events, and new partnerships. My life has changed so much since the time I was first introduced to Surf the Greats, and I know that many of these changes happened due to the strength that being part of this community gave me. I owe you one, Antonio. x"

I was surprised to find an authentic acai bowl as well - best I've had since my trip to Hawaii.  A welcome addition to the neighbourhood here in Leslieville and a must-see for anyone into surfing or surf culture.  Now I just have to get brave enough to get out in the water with them!"

I visited their shop for the first time with my little girls in Spring and couldn't believe this actually existed in Toronto. So cool! Their staff was extremely friendly and welcoming, making us feel like we belonged there. Since then, I've taken a SUP yoga class with Adrienne and she was just amazing. Most recently I tried their Intro to Surfing class with Haynes and really loved the experience. I highly recommend them to anyone who's looking for a new experience in the city and can't wait to take my next surf lesson when there are waves."

I asked him to clarify information, he then got defensive and yelled \"take your business elsewhere.\" He began to get verbally aggressive, I tried to defuse but he continued on a rampage. Was surprised at how disgusting his behavior is. BEWARE take your business elsewhere!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Would give 0 if I could! You would think a business teaching \"surf lessons\" on lakes with no waves would welcome all customer service as there is a serious lack of demand... Also, a total scam $185 to teach surfing in a FLAT lake with no waves!"

Baird developed a method of mechanical TV and Farnsworth figured out how to make it electronic.  There are many examples of early TVs up into the 1960's and the emergence of colour screens.  Our hosts gave a great tour of the ZoomerPlex facility including the radio stations and TV studios as well as an overview of the museum that is housed in the buildings.  This would be an eye opener for youth on how smartphones and digital TVs started out about 100 years ago. At less than $10 a person its a bargain."

For instance, while I had read that some people thought the government was spying on them via their televisions, I didn't know that a special television was made with a type of transparent glass for the 1934 World's Fair to prove to people that there were no tiny government officials in there looking to spy on them. It reveals all the hurdles that the television industry had to overcome to make their products appealing. I worked at the Museum of the Moving Image in Astoria, New York, and our collection of classic televisions pales in comparison to what this museum has to offer. ",

        "This museum is one of Toronto's great cultural treasures. It gives a visitor appreciation for the remarkable impact television has had on modern society. Technology, design, pop culture, information and entertainment, all in one gallery. And the original RCA Felix the Cat! If there was ever an icon of the burgeoning medium in the early 20th Century, its that exact cat. Well done, Moses and team. You've created something special"

        "One of the best and oldest comic book stores in Toronto. The Silver Snail is always a treat. They have a large selection of comics, graphic novels, games, and fandom merch. It's a nerd's paradise! They frequently run events like author meet and greets/book signings. Their staff are super friendly and helpful. There's an awesome cafe attached to it called the Black Canary that has excellent food & fandom-themed drinks. The cafe overlooks Yonge Street which is a nice urban view. The whole place is also really cooly decorated. It's located near the Eaton Centre and is within walking distance of other attractions, shopping, and restaurants. 10/10 would recommend. If you need another reason to visit, they charge USD cover price!"

A recent visit to this location was a real trip down memory lane. Great selection of comics new and old as well as really cool memorabilia and collectables, knowledgeable staff."

        "I have been to silver snail comics many many times, starting at a young age, and I've always been happy with my visit. They have everything from comics to statues, they will most likely have what you may be hunting. Unfortunately, I don't plan on going back for a while, mainly because they stopped ordering a certain product I liked, known as Funko Pops. They used to have tons, and now they have barely any. I would still recommend heading if you have a missing comic in your collection, because comics is where they shine."

        "When I stepped into Silver Snail, I was immediately amazed by how incredible two things were to me. The first is the layout of the store. While the space may seem small at first, they use it very well, with the new comics occupying the rack when you immediately enter the store on both sides. They include new issues & collected trade paperbacks. The back issues selection are kept in the drawers that occupy a large section of the store, but they are very organized and there's a high likelihood you'll find at least 1 thing on your list here.",
        "The second thing that stood out to me was the staff. They were very kind, courteous, and extremely helpful, happy to help customers out and answering any questions posted to them. They helped out when asked about creating a pull list (they're in the drawers with your name in last name alphabetical order across from the cash), and about special events that would be going on at the store, like Free Comic Book Day and sales. There's also a new rewards program they have going on in participation with several other local Toronto business called Vicinity where you collect points ($1 for every dollar you spend) and when you hit a tier like 100 points for example, you get $5 off (free comic!)",
        "The American cover price they charge is just the icing on the cake! They sell a lot of collectibles as well, so there's a lot of cool and wicked stuff you'll be able to find! They also have a coffee cafe right beside the comics area, where you can sit down with a coffee, tea or whatever your pleasure & enjoy your new comic(s).",
        "This sets a high standard for comics & if you're visiting Toronto & looking for a comics shop, this should be your stop! Very worth it!"

        "Visited the silver snail after seeing a Del Toro mention in a Hellboy volume. The store has since moved from that original location that looked massive. The store has sacrificed room for a coffee shop and this room could've been used to better display past issues. Much like my comic store in Australia it is a pain looking for back issues. The store people were friendly and often checked to see if I needed help. The graphic novels are easy to track and the weekly issues are all up on display. The store has a lot and you would be in geek heaven to visit, if you're tall it really sucks to squat down to the bottom shelves for back issues. "

The staff were kind and helpful. Everything seemed fair priced. We didn't get to try out the cafe as even midday midweek it was packed full of people but if we ever come back to Toronto we'll be sure to visit again. "

I hadnt been in many years and a couple days ago i went to enjoy 2 floors of cool collectibles. Much to my dismay they had moved from queen st west to yonge and dundas. So i thought ok new location bigger store and more selection. ",
        "When i arrived at the yonge street location i was sooooo disappoinent. Gone was 2 floors of a great selection of collectibles to a top floor of pretty much nothing. Like i mentioned i was really disappointment. Not only was it sooo much smaller in selection and size of store they had to waste the limited area to a coffee shop ??? All i know is What Happened ?? . Dont bother with this place anymore, its dead :("

        "Silver Snail Comic is a small and cozy comic store-cum-cafe located in the busy Yonge Street of Toronto Downtown. It is impossible to imagine that such a place exists in the heart of one the busiest cities in the world but it does. The moment you enter, you are shutting out the chaos of the hurried world outside and you are instantly taken into the magical world of comics and childhood. My boyfriend and I visited this store and both of us being comic geeks, AND coffee lovers, we ended up spending 2 hours there! They have the oldest original printed comics in store, figurines of all popular characters including Game of Thrones, and the sword of He-Man as well! The entrance is guarded by a statue of Spiderman hanging upside down. And the cafe is flanked by, of course, Batman and Superman on either sides. And there is a map of Middle Earth by the barista, with special emphasis on Mordor. And the specialty coffee menu was another thing: they had standard drinks as well as Hero and Villain Drinks! We ordered 2 Black Widows (spiced mocha) and sat and sipped our coffees while watching the busy Yonge street outside (which happens to be the longest street in the world!)"

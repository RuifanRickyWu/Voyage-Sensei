        "Four friends and I visited The Ballroom on a sunny day in May to drink on the patio. Our waitress didn’t show up for over a half hour, despite us asking multiple staff if someone could serve us and being told someone would be with us shortly. Despite being seated at 4:30, we didn’t manage to get a drink order in till after 5:00.",
        "I ordered two Caesars which are $5 each before 5:00 on Saturdays, having cleared with the waitress beforehand that since we were seated well before the cutoff they would honour the happy hour price. When I received the bill they had charged full price, at which point I reminded the waitress that we had discussed the price previously. They eventually knocked $10 off the total bill, which in the end still cost more than the advertised price.",
        "My friend ordered a beer at the same time as the rest of us. It didn’t come out with the rest of our drinks and after another 30 minutes waiting, our server informed us that this beer was sold out. At this point he had been in Ballroom for an hour and was still trying to get his first beer. ",
        "Those of us who had received drinks were again quickly out and looking for a refill, and again waiting for service. For an establishment that earns revenue by selling food and drink, they are not very good at it: while I understand that a server can be busy or not very good, other staff were no more helpful. Since we were having so much difficulty getting served we just got the bills and left. I believe that this is ultimately a loss to Bar Room, since we were out to spend a full afternoon and evening drinking and eating, which we did at another (much busier) bar down the street where we had no trouble getting served.",

        "Monday June 10th 2019 I planned to attend Ballroom with myself and 9 others. It was game 5 of the NBA Finals for Toronto Raptors AT HOME. It was a huge event. I called ballroom at the phone number (416) 597-2695 on Friday before the game to ask if they are taking reservations, their answer to me was they are doing not reservations that night, walk in only and suggested I arrive 6:30pm-7:30pm since the game starts at 9:00pm. My cousin who is a Manager at Jack Astors next door to you also told me he talked to someone and they said the same thing, no reservations that night, only walk ins. Every place was either booked or doing walk ins so we decided on going early to this venue. I called Saturday twice to confirm that, no answer, no answering machine. I called Sunday twice to try and confirm again, NO ANSWER AGAIN. No answering machine. Monday I came from Mississauga to watch the game at this venue. I arrived at Ballroom at 2:30pm. An entire 6 and a half hours before the game. A small group of 5, a young man and I were the only people there waiting. They took our names, phone numbers and size of group down on a waitlist for when the upstairs opens for 4pm they will go up in order and accommodate us at a table. I was 3rd on that list. I wanted to sit and eat while I waited but apparently there was an event coming on the lower level so I couldn't even sit down for the wait. 4pm comes around and they now say 5pm. 5pm comes around and nobody is no where to be found. The organization was so TERRIBLE. NOBODY knew anything going on, everyone was saying something different. Finally around 5:40pm some man comes down the stairs to inform everyone that there are NO TABLES AVAILABLE, ONLY STANDING ROOM LEFT. Which is absolutely RIDICULOUS since you told EVERYONE \"NO RESERVATIONS, WALK INS ONLY\". Somehow, some way, reservations were made and all the people who waited 3 hours were not able to get a table when they said no reservations. 3 hours you made me and many others wait, thinking they were getting a table. Clearly if were all willing to stand there and wait that long it's important to us. Now everyone there can't get a table, and theres no possible way to go anywhere else and wait and get a table because it's almost 6:00pm and now definitely everywhere it full. I was going to go up anyways and wait for my friends up there when this man said that if your group isn't here yet they won't be allowed up, we aren't holding space. Which is BS because I've been here waiting for hours. This man was now letting people upstairs for standing room a few people at a time. First group went, second group went, now when I went to go the people beside me who I made friends with let me go past them because they knew I was here waiting longer. When I went to go up the stairs this disgusting man put his arm out and stopped me and condescendingly said \"Are you with this group? No? So you can wait\". He did this because he was mad I was calling him out the BS that this all is. Now I wish I asked for this mans name to go corporate because the way he and this venue dealt with everything was ridiculous. After him sticking his arm out on me I left because that was disgusting. ",

        "We had really high expectations for this place. We (7 of us) had booked 2 lanes at 10 pm. When we got there we were told they were running a little behind. No big deal. Gave us time to get our bowling shoes and a couple of drinks before bowling time. 45 minutes later they told us they were ready for us. They directed us to our lane only to find out that they could only give us 1 lane instead of the 2 lanes we had booked. We were furious to say the least. Can you imagine???7 of us playing in 1 lane???? The hour passed and we didn't even finish the 8th round. The manager did give us all complimentary shooters with his apologies but still.......we wanted to bowl!!!! We will return and give this place a second chance but I don't have high hopes. Fingers crossed. ",

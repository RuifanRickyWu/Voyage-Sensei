  "description": "Etobicoke is a relaxed area along the Humber River. It's saturated with green spaces and conservatories, making it a premier destination for outdoor sports, hiking, and nature walks. Its abundance of parkland and lakes makes it a typical spot for fishing, picnicking, and camping out, especially in warmer months. The peaceful area is also enjoyed by families, who appreciate its boardwalks and sports facilities. Locals enjoy the variety of golfing and country club opportunities, which also provide lessons for golfers of any skill level.",

        "After lunch at Pho Ngoc Yen, our group travelled the short distance to Centennial Park Conservatory & Greenhouse in a two-car convoy. We arrived around 1:20pm and conveniently found 2 adjacent empty parking spots in the parking lot to the left of the conservatory. Centennial Park is a popular picnic spot so we were lucky we got to park easily in the early afternoon of a holiday (Victoria Day). Parking is free of charge.",
        "Admission to Centennial Park Conservatory is free of charge as well. Double entrance is at the front of the glass-enclosed greenhouse, behind  the flagpole. The conservatory is open every day, including holidays, from 10am to 5pm. A sign says last entry is at 4:45pm. Separate male and female multi-stall washrooms are located in the premises. There is even a water bottle refill station and drinking fountain.",
        "We spent 40 mins exploring the small conservatory looking at assorted tropical plants, trees, flowers and succulents. Not every plant on display is labelled. One of the plants we found interesting had curly green and yellow leaves which I’m sure I’ve never seen before. We also saw a Philippine lemon tree with massive, overripe calamansi fruit hanging on the branches. A staffer was busy working at one end of the greenhouse.",
        "Since it is warm inside, it is best to wear light clothing. Do bring a hat as the glass roof lets in sunlight in abundance. Plenty of bench seating for short stops or photo ops. ",
        "We spent the rest of the afternoon at the wooden pergola outside the conservatory where a huge tree provided welcome shade. Frogs living in the small pond regularly chimed in while our group conversed nonstop."

Beyond the spectacular Christmas displays of poinsettias, flowering cactus and azaleas, or the tulips and daffodils of the Spring, there are year-round tropical plants, cactus and orchids on display. There is a gentle waterfall and pond with Koi fish and turtles. I do miss the birds that they used to have here including a cockatoo named Angel who spoke to passers by as well as smaller cages with budgies and cockatiels. I am not sure why they are no longer part of the greenhouse. Note, on weekend visits especially Saturdays you may run into wedding parties taking photographs in some areas of the greenhouse. Also, in the cactus room it would be wise to keep your children well under control as most of the plants have prickly spines that kids could get into. All in all it is a peaceful, tranquil respite in cold weather seasons when you need a break away to a tropical setting without leaving town."

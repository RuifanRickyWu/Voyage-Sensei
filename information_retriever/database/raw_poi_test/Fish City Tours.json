        "Taro is an absolute legend. This guy not only understands fish and their patterns, but has an open mind. He is knowledgeable of his gear and more importantly how to entertain his clients. Taro took my girlfriend (beginner fisherlady) and I (intermediate fisherman) out on Lake Ontario for smallmouth bass and it was nothing short of the best day I've had fishing. Not only did he take the time to teach my girlfriend how to properly cast/retrieve a bait but he set her up for that  smallmouth bite that she's been itching to experience. Myself on the other hand, I took away valuable knowledge and tips that I could have never gained if I didn't book this trip. Taro genuinely loves what he does and it's evident he's successful. Cheers to future success buddy. Do yourself a favour and book a trip with him now!"

We were able to land19 quality bass in the 3 hours we had before the rains resumed, but best of all, we each caught a 4+ pound Smallie!Taro was enthusiastic and knowledgeable about where to find fish.  He was patient with me, a less experienced angler, and just as respectful of my husband who has more experience in the sport. We thoroughly enjoyed this fishing experience, and would highly recommend Taro's Fish City Tours to anyone."

The hits never stopped. Fish after fish hit baits as he rolled through his repertoire of bait du jour. Honestly, I'd go out on the water just to spend the day with this guy and hang out, but if you're looking for shore-lunch, TARO will deliver!"

        "We met at the dock and our adventure began.  Conditions were overcast with some light wind and we started off targeting largemouth bass.  Right away were onto the fish!  after a few hours the largemouth conditions changed but Taro compensated and kept us active bringing in the biggest perch I have ever seen!  We then did some dock skipping for largemouth bass.  Very fun technical fishing.  The largemouth bass fishing started to slow down with the wind and the overcast sky.  The sun came out and the lake became as flat as glass.  Taro mixed it up again for us and put us onto my favorite...Smallies!  The action was back up and popping again!",

        "I was lucky enough to be able to head out with Taro while i was in Toronto. Travelling half way round the world from Australia i've always wanted to catch Largemouth and Smallmouth Bass. I was not disappointed with my full days guide with Taro. He got me onto the fish and was very friendly and plenty of laughs were had. He was willing to go with the flow and allowed me to try any technique i wanted to and always got me to areas that were productive. If your ever near Toronto and wanted a half day for full days guide I can highly recommend  Fish City Tours. He taught me some new techniques that i can't wait to try on the species back home. We caught fish all day. If i'm every back in the Toronto area i will be definitely booking another tour with Taro."

      "text": [
        "I found Fish City Tours and Taro on social media and I decided to pull the trigger and hire him for a 5 hour charter.  My wife and I had the pleasure of spending last sunday morning with Taro on Rice Lake while we DOMINATED THE WATER!  Needless to say, I would recommend him and these are the top five reasons why:",
        "1. He catered the experience to what we wanted",
        "My wife and are are on different spectrums of fishing excellence and he was able to keep us both happy.  He recognized that I wanted to really actively smash the fish, while my wife was content to bait drag, vertical jig and just chill.  When my wife decided that she wanted to fish more actively, Taro taught her how to do that.",
        "2. Taro is a Jedi Master, and a great teacher",
        " He was able to teach my wife about the basics like casting, how to jig, how to set the hook and different things to expect while fishing.  For me it was cool to pick his brain about what he is looking for in fishing spots.  He was able to teach me concepts and techniques that I can use next time I go fishing.  When I go fishing, i dont have a fish finder, GPS or all the other fancy electronics, but he showe me key things to look for.",
        "3. He knows what he is talking about",
        "To be a good teacher you have to have a to know what you are talking about, and Taro knows!  There was a point where during the day where I just lost a fish, and after that the fishing slowed for a bit.  So he made an adjustment, and on the first cast after it was FISH ON!",
        "4. He puts you on Fish!",
        "As I said earlier, we were on the water for 5 hours and in that time I caught 25 plus fish.  Honestly I lost count after 15. The action didn't start out so hot, so we tired different presentations, baits/ lures.  Once  he found the pattern, it was lights out! ",
        "5. He is an overall good Dude!",
        "Taro is easy to get a long with.  He kept the vibe on the boat light and he took time to get to know my wife and I. He talked about his wife and his kids, his love for Nike's and shared a few fish stories.  He is definitely a people person.",
        "I have been on other fishing charters with different guides and companies over the last couple of years and by far, this one was the best. I will defintely recomend Fish City Tours and I will be booking again."

        "Spent a day fantastic chasing pike with Taro on Lake Ontario. Boat was well equipped and will only get better as a new boat is scheduled to arrive the week after my charter. Fishing gear was in excellent working order and included quality tackle from Shimano, G. Loomis and St Croix. Taro had a massive selection of lures and worked really hard all day to get the best result possible for the client. Many lure and position changes. Taro used all of the technology at his disposal, including several fish finders and an underwater camera, to find the fish. Weather was tricky but despite that we ended up with 7 pike. The largest was a 37\" 12 lb. monster which was landed on 6lb. test nylon monofilament. 2 other fish over 7 lbs and nothing less than 3 lb. Would highly recommend Taro to anyone visiting Toronto. He really knows his stuff and shares his knowledge readily. The day will last long in my memory."

        "Just came back from an absolutely epic day on the water with Fish City Tours! I had heard/read phenomenal reviews about Taro, but the actual experience far exceeded my expectations. We started the day bright and early targeting Spring Pike - despite horrible rainy/cold conditions, we landed 5 fish and lost a bunch more in the first few hours of fishing. I was delighted with this result but Taro was not happy - we made some adjustments to our approach and switched locations. The move paid off big time - I had the single most productive afternoon of fishing I have ever had in my life, landing a number of big fish (brown trout, steelhead, carp, freshwater drum, smallmouth bass) in the span of a few hours - the action was non-stop and my arms were exhausted. I have hired many guides across North America - but I have never seen this level of dedication to customer service. Taro is undoubtedly one of the most knowledgeable guides I have every fished with and the knowledge I took away from this trip will pay dividends for many trips to come. He is a genuinely nice guy (hilarious as well!) who has the utmost passion for his craft and really cares about sharing it with his customers. He goes more than the extra-mile and really cares about making the trip a very memorable experience for his customers. I cannot wait to book the next trip with Fish City Tours in the summer! Thanks Taro! Dean"

He'll teach you more than any angler I've met, but he'll also leave you to your own devices if you know your techniques. I've fished with him close to 20 times over the past four or five years and have caught hundreds and hundreds of fish. 40-\"+50\" Muskies, beast Northerns, 9lb Walleyes, mammoth Buckets and Smallies, Trout, Steelies, Drum, Carp, White Bass, Crappie, Rainbows, Bowfins, hell I even caught a +2lb beastmode Rock Bass with him. It doesn't matter. He's fished with the greatest (Izumi and Saric to name two) because he is one of the greatest of all time. He's also a great guy and a lot of fun to fish with. I'm 10 times the angler I was prior to meeting Taro. He's like The Wiz, nobody beats him"

Hes not your standard guide who does all the work, hooks the fish and then lets you reel. The rod is in your hands, you cast, you , hook and you reel.

Better yet - and most impressive -he knew how to teach the novice fishermen in our group to catch them, and the more experienced to adapt their techniques to the fish being sought- comfortably , with patience and humour . The result- everyone caught fish , and everyone caught LARGE fish .One member -who hadn't intended to fish and tried at the last minute - was as successful as all the others. Some of the group pulled up the largest fish they had ever caught.  ",

I am from New Jersey and I was led to Taro on my hunt for giant smallmouth.   His knowledge of his fishery is absolutely second to none.  He is incredibly in tune and knows what it takes to get bites in any given conditions.  The first time I fished with him last fall he put my on my personal best smallmouth many times in the 3 days. I caugh many life time smallmouth until the very end of my last day when I landed a 7lb 10oz GIANT.  He knew exactly the type of trip I was looking for and it could not have gone any better. I had such a great time I booked 3 more days in the spring and I will be back again this year (and many more).  Beyond the incredible fishing I can assure you all of thre things....1) Even the most experienced anglers in the world will learn something from fishing with Taro.  NO QUESTION.  2) There will be no shortage of entertainment.  His experience/stories are often beyond belief (but undoubtedly true).  You are sure to laugh ALL day long regardless of fishing conditions.  3) You will gain a friend in this man, he is one of the most likable guys I have met thus far.  Honest, hard working, and as fun as they come.  I'll be back soon!"

        "I went on a fishing trip with Taro and it was the most pleasant experience I ever had. We went out in the morning, it was actually dark out when we met him. The weather was a little cold but we decided to go out anyways. I had not gone fishing I a long time and i can truly say that since I was a kid I liked fishing but because of my busy schedule I never really had a chance to get out but with Fish City Tours it was an amazing feeling to be able to actually get away from my everyday routine and enjoy a day of relaxation. We went out all day on lake Simcoe and we caught a lot of nice fishes. Most of them were fairly large size but we didn't catch no monsters (lol). He is very knowledgable in what to do and how to catch the fish and what to use for what kind of a fish. I also want to emphasis that he was very professional and educated about the marine life and different species of fish in Ontario and made me really interested in the outdoor experience. I would definitely go out with him again very soon and I recommend Fish City Tours to anyone who wants to go out for a good time.  "

        "We had a great day on the lake with Taro. His passion for fishing made our excursion even more enjoyable. We learned so much from him! We were new to fishing at this level and he was very patient and took the time to help us get the hang of it. He also knew exactly where to go on Lake Simcoe to find the fish and he was just as excited as we were with our catches! Was a great experience overall and I think would make for a good gift idea too. Definitely would like to re-book to experience a different season and different type of fish! Thanks Taro!"

        "He insisted I had to fish a certain lure. If I didn't fish his recommended lure he would start swearing and making mocking condescending comments.",
        "I made a bad cast and got a lure stuck in a tree . He would not stop the boat and made a dismissive comment about my fishing line when it broke.",
        "Later we switched to another Kawartha lake and instead of boating over to a shore washroom he gets out of the boat and craps in the lake?",
        "THe zany fishing experience continued with his insistence that we had to fish for black crappie? This was a muskie fishing trip! Later he gets the largest muskie on his line",
        "and it jumps and completely rips his lure off! So much for his choice of quality terminal  tackle! THe worst part was at the end of the trip his crappy transmission on his old truck breaks down at the boat ramp at Fenlon Falls. The tow truck driver was able to fix the truck  It was a Strange Day fishing with this guy. Never again!"

A.A visit to the location the day before to see that the water and fish conditions were likely to be. ",

        " We , including novice , and slightly more experienced members, again caught- and released-  the biggest fish ever - even bigger than last year's big ones. No previous fishing experience is necessary as Taro adapts his instruction as necessary. ",
        "This was a highly informative and fun experience-one I would highly recommend, and more importantly, be happy to repeat. "

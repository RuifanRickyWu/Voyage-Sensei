        "5 of us did the Red Admiral Room. It was overall fun except one of the clues did not activate for us when we entered the right code. We wasted 15-20 minutes trying to figure out how to open a door when we had already figured it out by entering the code in the keypad. The keypad flashed green but nothing happened. After spending 20 minutes trying to see if there was something we missed in the other rooms, we called for a clue and they told us how to do the clue we already did (entering the code into the keypad). We entered the exact same code again and finally the door opened for us. ",
        "We explained this to the staff at the end and they sort of just be dismissed us. It definitely ruined the experience for us at the end because we would have finished the room if it wasn’t for that."

We are all huge Harry Potter fans (we even showed up with wands) and loved the way the room made us feel like we were students at Hogwarts.

We have done many rooms and were a team of 4 doing this 4/5 difficulty room; we made it to the very last puzzle and had it solved but it was a tiny bit of a stretch and a bit unfair.  There was also a colour issue earlier which was unfair and required us to burn a clue for no reason (host stated it has been an issue with other teams...why not fix the thing if multiple people have had issues with it?).  I don't want to reveal too much about those but these are small issues in an otherwise amazing room.  ",

This is pretty unacceptable, I'm not sure what the right way to deal with this is as a business where promptness is required, but it sure sucked to be that team that had to wait because someone else couldn't show up on time.  We weren't offered another room as an alternative or any discount, etc, just a sorry.  I hope that's a rare event as the rest of this place is excellent and I think it's 5/5 stars."

It had its intense moments in terms of exertion, but it's not like only the physically fit can play (some obstacles would require a little bit of dexterity to navigate, but you can take the long route to go around it as well). Wayne did a great job picking and choosing game modes to balance exertion and strategy. My personal favorite mode was Bang! - it took a while to get through the rules and instructions, but if you're into deception-type games this one's great.

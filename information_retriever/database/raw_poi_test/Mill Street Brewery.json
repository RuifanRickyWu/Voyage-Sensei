  "description": "Get a true craft experience with daily brewery tours, seating surrounding the glass encased, still operational brew house and an ever rotating list of small batch brews alongside our classics. On the go? Our retail store is fully stocked with the freshest packaged Mill Street Brews. About Mill Street Brewery: Our story begins in the winter of 2002 when we opened the doors to our little red brick brewery in Toronto's historic Distillery District. With an earth-friendly philosophy in mind, Original Organic Lager was the first beer we ever made, and the first ever organic beer brewed in Canada. Soon after we impressed curious craft drinkers with Tankhouse Ale, a uniquely flavour-forward brew for its time. In 2006, we exceeded the capacity of our modest brewhouse and made the decision to expand the brewery, converting the original brewery space into a brewpub. 2012 saw us take on Ottawa's vibrant craft beer scene, opening a second brewpub in a historic old gristmill on the banks of the Ottawa River. We certainly never lost our dedication to our craft and passion for pushing the envelope. Our ever-expanding portfolio now includes over 60 unique beers earning us well over 100 awards, including 3-time Canadian Brewery of the Year. That's our story up till now. Who knows where our \"Great Beer\" adventure will take us next?",

The lettuce wraps were nicely presented but they gave the limpest 4 pieces of lettuce I have ever seen to wrap the ingredients up in so everything g fell apart immediately. 2 normal size pieces of lettuce and 2 tiny unusable sized pieces of lettuce. They may as well of chopped it all up and gave us a fork. Go somewhere else. Huge waste of money."

The hostess was too busy flirting with her friend/coworker/who knows who cares to even bother to greet us. It took five minutes for us to be acknowledged and told that we could sit at one of the hi-tops near the bar. Upon finding a table, we waited another 15 minutes for the server to actually stop by and take our order. It's not the server's fault--she was friendly and apologized for the situation several times--but at the end of the day, there isn't a good excuse for this nonsense. The vegan burger and skinny fries were decent and probably the highlight for us. All in all, we won't be coming back until the dismal service is addressed."

I will say, it was very cool to see the oldest brewery in Toronto— it is certainly a landmark that many Canadians are very proud of— but the beer wasn’t all that great. I tried two different flavors, and both were so unpleasant that I didn’t finish either one of them. The guy who helped us though was very nice— he really knew his beer, and did his best to help me choose one I liked! I don’t regret stopping by, again, because it is a landmark, but I would have been upset if I had to have paid for the Beer."

Our server was no better.  Sighed and looked disinterested when we asked her to explain what sides were served with dishes.  My son had a burger which looked lovely, I had a chicken and chorizo pot pie which was served with cold fries and very little chicken and no chorizo.  The place was very busy therefore the service was slow, food dumped on the table, server didnt ask if we needed ketchup etc.  I think the staff feel they are doing you a massive service by allowing you in. please do not waste your money. Much better restaurants in the area with better food and service."

The seasonal Nightmare on Mill Street and the Cobblestone Nitro Stout came a very close 2nd and 3rd.  We sat at the bar the first time we visited as we had planned to eat next door in the brew pub.  The next three times we visited, we always sat at the bar.  The waiters were extremely friendly and efficient and we got to know a couple of them quite well by the end of the trip, Clint and Eric.  They were brilliant.  ",

We still had this sat at the bar and the food was lovely.",

Yes we went slightly out of season being early November and I can imagine it being very busy in Summer or at Christmas and maybe people visiting at this time had a different experience.  I though can only speak from my personal experience and if I was ever in Toronto again, this would be the first place I would head for.  it was fantastic and a memory I will treasure forever."

        "On Sat Nov 23rd, my friend and I went to the Toronto Christmas Market. It was a great afternoon weather wise and having never been to the market it was a great treat.  Finding a place to eat wasn't too difficult, the Mill Brewery sounded perfect.   I just wanted to say that although the place was packed and we were told it would be up to an hr wait, our buzzer went off with 20 min and we were seated right away.   The food came nice and hot and in particular I wanted to give a shout out to our server Dylen Guiry. He was so friendly, knew the menu inside out and was very attentive even during a busy night.  There was a bit if a hicc6with my order and Dylen was quick to rectify the situation.  Overall delicious food and pleasant service. I'd definitely go back again.  If you have Dylen as your sever just say the ladies with crabcakes and double fish and chips did come through with a Trip Advisor review.  "

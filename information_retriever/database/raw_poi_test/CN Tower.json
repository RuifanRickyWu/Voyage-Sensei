  "description": "Climb this 1,815-foot-tall observation tower to have the whole of Toronto at your feet and overlook up to 100 miles on a clear day. Once the tallest structure on Earth for over 30 years, the CN Tower attracts travelers to its two observation decks—one of which features a glass floor. If you’re looking for an extra thrill, try Edgewalk, where you can walk hands-free on a ledge surrounding the top floors. The tower is also home to the award-winning 360 Restaurant, which completes a rotation around the structure every 72 minutes, giving you an ever-changing view of the city while you dine. – Tripadvisor",

The glass floor section is thrilling – standing on it and looking straight down is an exciting and unique experience!",

I’d rather walk the streets of the city to get a feel for Toronto than look at it from on high.  Beware the photo they take as you enter.  If you decide to buy one with an artificial background, it’s $35 Canadian, $40 for two.  Better to take your own camera and shoot a photo with the city or islands in the background."

Its a very impressive experience , the whole restuarant rotates giving you a 360 degree view of the city , the food on the other hand didnt live up the the rest of it , we mainly ordered steaks and the quality was very poor for premium cuts, we had been enjoying better steaks all week in resturants in the area and they didnt come close, so overall a great experience let down by the quality of the food."

Sadly the weather wasn’t as good as it could have been so the views were a bit cloudy and we could see rain in the distance but you can still see a long way.  Well worth the visit."

There may be a small wait to get to the top floor as the lift is smaller and some people need to travel down to allow more up.  The views are amazing.  We were brave enough to do the walk outside but you can look down on those doing it which is an experience in itself.  Worth the money to go."

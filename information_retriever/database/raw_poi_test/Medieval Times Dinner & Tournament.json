Plenty to see from the horses on their stalls, the falcons, the gift shops etc. The queues were good and well organized.  Service was great.  The arena show itself was very well done.  Cheering and booing by all when the Knights started the games.  Cannot say enough about much fun we had with our relatives who were visiting from England.   Easy access from the Exhibition GO Station.  About an 8 min walk."

This was my 5th time here.l (and probably the last). The food has gotten worse each visit but this was by far the worst. My entire group of 10 people all felt the same way. The soup was good but it was room temperature which I was not a fan of as I like my soup warm. My father’s chicken came raw (twice) but the third one was cooked. The chicken quality was terrible and could not chew it. It came with 1 dried out wedge of potato and dried out corn. We upgraded for cake but it was not good. The eclairs that came with the meal were ok. We all left hungry though :(. The show itself is good to experience but have low expectations for the food."

Plenty of other people were dressed Medieval-ish too. The earlier you show up, the better your seats seem to be. You do have a bit of a wait beforehand, but there's plenty to see inside. There are also lots of things to buy. The whole show was very entertaining and the food was good. It does seem quite expensive, but afterwards we were quite happy with the value for the money. We even got pictures with our knight afterwards and he signed our crowns. I would definitely return."

The staff were amazing at getting us in quickly, there’s parking on site (about $20). We had our photo taken which us also about $20 which you can get at the end of the show. ",

Our serve Stanley was AMAZING!!! Shout out to Stanley! He came round with drinks and filled our cups up (choice of soft drinks) Myself and my partner let the lady at the front desk know we were vegetarian. We were given a card that was placed at our table. Stanley then have us starters. Soup and garlic bread, it was tasty and kids are it. We had bean stew with corn for our main. The kids had half a chicken each (portions were wildly large) with half a potato and corn. ",

A couple of things to consider before going - if you don't want to stand around dodging the very overpriced gift shop, arrive 30 minutes before your show. There is absolutely NOTHING to do once inside the \"castle\" as the dungeon is closed since covid. You can have a quick peak at some horses through glass and then you listen to the kids whine about all the stuff they don't need in the gift shop. Second, take a cooler if you have a car. There will be food left over if you have kids. The dinner is half a chicken, half a potato, corn, soup, garlic bread and dessert. Should you upgrade to VIP? Same show, same dinner. VIP gets you into the arena first but the show won't start until everyone is seated. You get seated lower but again, there are really no bad seats so being higher up isn't a bad thing. It's not like you're in the nosebleed section, it isn't that bad. We paid $15/person for the VIP upgrade and I don't think I'd do it again. Your choice."

Doors open 1.5 hours before the performance but they do not let you into sit at your table until 15 mins prior to the show starting so you are basically left wandering around the very large gift shop.  Any person who upgrades to VP status is let in first so there is no point in lining up and they ask you not to as you block the doors.  The dinner was good, eaten with your fingers, soup, garlic bread, very large pieces of chicken, potato and corn.  We could not eat it all and the kids picked away at it.  We upgraded to the middle package and it was $7 extra per person, we got a family photo for each person, priority seating and upgraded desert, cake.  Parking is $15.  Kids enjoyed it.

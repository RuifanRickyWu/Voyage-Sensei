We did 2 nice hikes, which are fine for people that are not that active (like me). The views were amazing. The weather was not that good but it didn’t stop us from doing a hike. Make sure you bring a raincoat and bug spray. We had a campfire with s’mores at night and slept in our tent. We also went kayaking on a big lake. You can choose between kayaking or canoeing.

We camped next to a beautiful lake, played bocce ball and played cards in the slow times. We went for hikes, checked out the logging museum and did some canoeing. We didn't have to bring a car, worry about packing things or bringing enough food. Everything was taken care of by our host/guide Damian. Super chill weekend without stress of packing/unpacking gear.

I am so glad we went with Damian, he was so mindful to our needs from bringing Halal meat options with him to being flexible to the needs of the group and different ages of the team.

The entire experience was thoroughly worthwhile as it combined the traditional items that adorn the house along with a variety of artifacts and information boards that are specific to this presentation put on by the University of Toronto Museum Studies Graduate Program. We learned a lot, not only about old Toronto but food history also. We were there for over an hour and could have stayed longer as there was much to take in."

        "This was second on our list for day 1 of Doors Open Toronto weekend (May 28-29). We got here after lunch and the lineup had already reached past the gates and about halfway to the corner of Queen St W and University Ave. We waited 28 mins to get inside Campbell House Museum for a self-guided tour. Staff outside the front doors told us to check out the 2 ground floor rooms first then head upstairs and finally let ourselves out at the back.",
        "I initially thought that Campbell House Museum would be like other historic houses--such as the restored Mackenzie House also in downtown Toronto--that provide a snapshot of life in the 1800s. Campbell House has the distinction of being the oldest surviving building from the Town of York but I did not realize it was more of an exhibit space than a museum house. I was expecting an 1800s era house furnished with historic artifacts but then I started seeing contemporary art pieces here and there, which, to my untrained eye, looked entirely out of place. There was a humanoid table and what looked like melted wax frame in the dining room and a weird-looking sedan chair in the other room. I was confused at first because I had no idea what I was looking at. I obviously did not do my homework or I would have known what to expect. I did like the Town of York diorama encased in glass on the second floor landing.",
        "I am not a big fan of museum-house-meets-contemporary-art so Campbell House lost some of its appeal to me. I believe we saw 4 rooms in all, 2 downstairs and 2 upstairs, but we actually spent more time in the queue outside than inside this place. Good thing we saved $10/person since admission was free on Doors Open day."

The show was inspired by a Canadian soldier, George  Stephen Cantilever who sent letters home to his youngest child every day he was overseas and Includeded in each letter was a flower he had picked. That is the basis of the multi sensory display. There are 10 stations, each with a handwritten letter to his daughter Celia and the accompanying flower. At each station is a picture of the flower, an explanation of its significance, and a button one can push and get the scent of the flower. Each of the stations names a Canadian who was involved in the war.  At each station is an exquisite piece of crystal with scenes of the war. The walls of the two rooms of the exhibit are draped with black cloths. On these drapes are printed the names of the 68,000 Canadian soldiers who died in WW1. One comes away reflecting on how human nature can find beauty in the most horrible of ceircumstances. Well worth an hour of your time."

The food was fresh, tasty, and nicely presented, though there were not enough places to lay items down: because of the many antiques and their desire, of course, to preserve them, we had to be mindful of the tiny signs warning us not to \"place anything here\". The location is downtown just west of city hall and within walking distance to the Eatons Centre and Union Station. The decor with its high ceilings and generous room sizes was ideal for our purposes. Large groups of 75 or more, however, may find a harder time. The bathrooms were rather grotty and tucked away into the basement. One of the guests was in need of wheelchair access, which was unavailable (\"small steps\" are NOT accessible). Luckily other guests were able to help her."

        "We were walking around Toronto one day and just happened to come across the Campbell House Museum without knowing that it was a museum. I went to the front door, turned the doorknob, and opened the door. I called for my husband to come inside. Entry was by donation. We were given a tour of the house which we really enjoyed. I was allowed to take photos which was wonderful as I love the period furnishings of older homes. The Campbell House Museum is very close to the Law Courts. Mr. Campbell was a High Court Judge in Upper Canada in his day. He actually presided over the case in which William Lyon Mackenzie sued a certain number of men who broke into his home and threw much of his print shop machinery into Lake Ontario. Instead of retaliating in kind, Mackenzie sued them and took them to court. Mackenzie won his case as there were witnesses to the event who testified on his behalf. Downstairs by the front door there is a miniature court room scene of that trial. Mackenzie is shown with red hair but apparently he wore a red wig as he was balding. The house itself is not large but the curved staircase leading to the second floor is lovely. The Campbell House Museum is supported by the Photographic Historical society Of Canada and the University Of Toronto Museum Studies Exhibition Fund. Upstairs is a room that is used an art gallery now. When the Campbell's lived there they apparently used the room as a ballroom. This museum is not suitable for small children as there are stairs to climb and the furnishings are not to be touched. The furniture itself may not be the original furniture but is appropriate to the time period. The whole tour took about a half an hour to 45 minutes. When we were  ready to leave I started for the front door and without touching it the door opened itself. I thought perhaps that the tour guide had pressed a button to open it but when I asked if the door usually opened on its own, she said no. It wasn't windy outside so it seemed  to me that some unseen person opened the door for us. This was certainly unusual  and it made an impression! The Campbell House Museum is situated at 160 Queen St. W., Toronto. If you are interested in the history of Upper Canada and want to learn more about it, a stop here is definitely worthwhile.",

        "We had visited the Mackenzie House the day before and knew from that visit that there was a connection with the Campbell House. The house is a large (for the time) Georgian style home that has been moved and restored and seems well cared for. Our guide explained Judge Campbell's role in Canadian history while explaining how the house would have looked and operated when the Campbells lived there. There was no admission fee but token donations are appreciated.  The house is located in the downtown area near City Hall.  The tour is brief and is well worth stopping by for if you enjoy visiting historical homes."

        "I took my classes and the program offered was rich, interesting and had the visitor enter that house atmosphere, routines and practical sense of Torontonians inhabiting such a house in the middle of the 19th century.  Kudos to the lively, welcoming guides, dressed in period clothes and who had a real play ready for us."

        "Although we had previously visited the house a few years ago, we learned even more on this visit.  The tour guide shared a wealth of information about the house and the period.  It amazes me how much these people know and their passion for the house and period.  It is a wonderful piece of history right in the middle of the city."

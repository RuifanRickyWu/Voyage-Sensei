        "The show was divided into a series of short stories, some funny, some poignant, all beautifully performed. However, at least one third of the show was designed to promote falun gong (falun dafa). I have nothing against this or any other religion. However, I very much resent being lured in to see a dance troupe, only to find that a lot of the show was to promote falun gong. If I had known in advance, I would NOT have gone."

      "title": "consider listening to the mp3 instead: the visual component is consistently missing",
      "text": [
        "Operas here used to be among the best in the world, in my opinion – and I have seen many performances all around the world. In the past several year the quality dramatically changed, mostly for the visual component. The orchestra is still superb, and the voices are mostly decent, but the decoration of the set is so minimalistic that one better stays home and listen to mp3 for free and not pay 200$ per ticket. This visual deprivation was done by the Canadian Opera House to even most classic operas that normally bring a great visual impression, in addition to the sound – Aida, Barber of Seville, Carmen, Marriage of Figaro and now Macbeth. All these great operas in their latest production now have the same black&grey & brown decor, simplistic and depressive. Barocco operas are stripped of their visual components entirely; characters are in business suits on semi-empty stages. Macbeth also was economizing on lightning so badly that we barely saw what was happening, and having the whole stage in the dark grey and brown, with all characters dressed in black or dark grey in such poor light doesn’t help. Considering that majority of patrons in the audience have grey-hair age, proper light and color contrasts are important. Late arrivals who were offered to watch the opera on the screen told me that it was so dark picture that it was no point in looking at the screen. Only when it was curtain time, and there was a bit more light, we could see that the characters’ boots looked blue – the color was completely missed during the performance. Plus the female choir and the lead female singer really struggled during the latest performance – I was surprised that this choir was out of synch and power. Normally the COC \"delivers\" the sound. Male singers were all superb, and so was the orchestra. However, looking at consistently black-grey-brown design that the new director prefers I now wonder if we have to continue our membership there. Yes, Macbeth opera is dark, but it is the responsibility of the director to make sure that the characters are visible, contrasted with each other and from the background, as their behaviour and facial expression in the scene are part of the story. Here not only was colour contrast missing, plus a deficit of light made it difficult to see the details, but the main characters looked alike, had the same beards, hairstyles, and clothing – so it was hard to trace who was who (with exception of the last group in red)."

We attended a performance of La Traviata, the best we've seen and heard in several years, including performances in Venice and Berlin. Amina Edris was an effective Violetta; her voice and acting were both very fine. Matthew Polenzani and Simone Piazzola were also excellent as Alfredo and his father. The production was free of directorial quirks of the kind that are as likely to irritate as delight. A splendid afternoon!"

The sound of the orchestra in the Nutcracker Performance was not loud but was just appropriate for the performance. My only complaint about the food and drinks in Torontos theatres is that they are so expensive. A small water bottle costs $4 which is like buying a water bottle in Iceland or Paris."

Using a green forest stage where all the action and characters chased each other, the audience were immersed in a forest fantasy escaping reality for awhile suspended in high culture recreation of a dream courtesy of National Ballet artistry and talent. Sartre Being and Nothingness was set in a broken home taken apart while couples intimacies were spied on by men in black, music by Glass, choreography by Cote."

The production, originally designed by Robert Carsen, another Canadian, for the Met, is spare and very effective.

Standing room tickets were available the night of the show, & dare i say, if you r looking for a last minute world class experience its worth the $12.

I highly recommend this attraction that continues through to December 30, 2018 whether you are a fan of the ballet or not. A fine example of modern day theatrical magic and wonder for all ages. Easy access in the heart of Toronto by nearby TTC subway university line at the corner of University and Queen St w. If you prefer to drive, there is parking available in the parking garage entry from York St. We were able to park inside, and leave our coats in the car, walk through the warm parking garage and take the elevator up to the theater entrance. There is a large bright lobby with some areas to sit and relax before the doors open to the theater. Refreshment is available and you can pre-order for the intermission. "

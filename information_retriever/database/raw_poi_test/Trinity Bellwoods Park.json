If you have children, make sure to inspect the sand and grass for needles. It's a shame that kids can't be care-free in city parks."

You'll find picnickers, dog walkers, hippies, and people just enjoying the day. Not as sprawling as High Park and but with a greater green canopy of many other smaller parks, this is perfectly accessible for those who can't or don't want to walk far. And if you do? It's a nice stroll end to end. In the north west corner you'll find a bemused looking bronze bust depicting the Liberator, Simón Bolívar. The image of the Venezuelan hero appears surprised to be in a Canadian park."

        "Where do I start? First off I got an airbnb apartment in this amazing neighborhood. My purpose for the trip was to go to the OVO fest concert that Drake throws every year. It also happened to be Caribana which is an amazing Caribbean festival that occurs every year. Toronto has a very eclectic mix of ethnicity. Unlike the U.S., people actually get a long up here. The most cleanest city I have seen since Chicago. A very walkable city and public transportation is simply amazing. Canadians are amongst the most kindest people I have ever encountered and the culture seems to embrace that kindness. My suggestion would be to get the CITYpass because you will save slot of money doing so and arrive to places early. use the cabs as they are pretty cheap in comparison to a bigger city. The Food here is amazing. I am very fond of a 24 hour diner called The Thompson. Very upscale and the food is AMAZING ! Go to Kensington Markets ! King and Queens street have amazing bars and clubs "

It is more of a city park, as opposed to High Park's almost wilderness feel, and the summer months will mean that this place is full of people.  Digging a little deeper reveals that there is some history here, specifically Garrison Creek, which lies hidden below, having been long since buried.  The city of Toronto guided walk for Garrison Creek is one of the more interesting ones in the city, and this park forms the backbone of it."

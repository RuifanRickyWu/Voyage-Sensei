As others said, this is in the TD Towers, which makes it near a lot of other things downtown (CN Tower, Rogers Centre, St. Lawerence Market) and so worth 30 minutes of popping in. There is no signage, so go into the building, see the few objects and paintings in the lobby of the Tower, and then go up the stairs to the mezzanine level.  You will see statues depicting life and stories from 1950s to the 2020s. Worth the stop!"

        "The Inuit gallery is in the South Tower of the 4 black towers that make up the TD Centre, downtown.  This is one of the rare FREE activities in Toronto and will take up probably no more than 30 or 40 minutes of your day.  There is a lower level window gallery at the west end of the elevator waiting areas.  Then, you go up a flight of stairs to the main display of cases, each featuring several Inuit carvings.  It is not easy to find a place in the city that displays a good selection of Inuit art, apart from the Art Gallery of Ontario, which costs about $20  to get into.  If you want a good introduction to Canada's indigenous Inuit art, this is the place to go.  The only drawback is the endless 'pinging' of the elevators nearby - not exactly a place to contemplate art.  But, you should go, nonetheless.  Be sure to see the cows on the nearby lawn, too, and the elephants at the CIBC Centre on the other side of Bay Street.  Enjoy!"

They are well displayed and not too many pieces. Most unusual at least for me. There are stores in Toronto which have good pieces to sell and in a range one may be able to afford and some are quite pleasing to the eye."

Sculptures in  stone are primarily featured but there are also some fine works in bone, antler and ivory (on the ground level).  Especially noteworthy is a carved walrus tusk with more than a dozen animals and figures. Too bad it (and some others) were placed on the bottom of the exhibit case and hard to see and appreciate.",

The bulk of the gallery is up the stairs behind the elevators.",

The admission is free since the gallery is situated on both side of the entrance hall of the Dominion Centre and on a kind of mezzanine floor. There is pretty much on display and a booklet with explanation about some of the pieces displayed. The booklet is a bit messy though, because there isn't a proper order and the visitors have to look a bit around to see the pieces the booklet explains: there are no signs or number whatsoever to make the task a bit easier. So you have to be a bit pacient on this side. Neverthless the Gallery is really worth seeing."

We have seen a lot of Inuit art but this contained pieces dealing with topics which are \"modern\".  As well, other pieces reflected themes we had never seen.  So especially if you are a fan of Inuit art then you will find value in stopping in.  And of course the best part is that it is free."

It is located in the lobby of the South Tower of the TD Centre on Wellington Street West. A big pro is that it's free to visit. The exhibits are laid out really nicely and there are some very interesting examples of Inuit art. I wish it was bigger and provided more background information, so I would not advise making a special trip to this gallery, but if you are passing by or have a particular interest in the subject then it is a must-see."

I also loved the museum shop, I got a handmade Inukshuk and some other bits and pieces as gifts."

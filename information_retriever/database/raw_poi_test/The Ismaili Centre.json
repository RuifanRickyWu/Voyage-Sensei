        "The building is very beautiful and has peaceful ambience and surroundings. It was a worth it visit and was very educational with the tour guide explaining in detail the history of Islam and especially the Ismailis (followers of the hereditary Imam, decedent from Prophet Mohammad, PBUH, His Highness Prince Karim Aga Khan), The inner court and prayer house is very serene and has a beautiful vista of Toronto from the roof top. ",

        "So, when I first visited, I thought it was a mosque like no other, unfortunately however, worship is only allowed for Ismaili Muslims. But the centre does offer free tours, and you can visit the centre for various events that take place throughout the year. A beautiful compromise between Islamic and western architecture, the whole area has this divine and spiritual aura that can't be explained, and I highly recommend visiting. But I also suggest one visit the neighbouring Aga Khan museum in addition to the Ismaili centre, as the former has dining options, as well as requires more time to explore."

His pride was evident as he took us about - a pride that was absolutely warranted.",

        "If you drive on the Don Valley Parkway, you've probably noticed an oddly shaped but beautiful glass \"dome\" not far from the highway on the east side. The IC is adjacent to the better-known Aga Khan Museum and shares some beautifully landscaped grounds with it but is a separate entity. The IC seems to be a combination of prayer hall and a sort of community centre with an eye to mindfully interfacing with the general public (outside the hours of worship). Our small group took a guided tour and were bowled over by the building's hybrid of modern aesthetics and an eclectic approach to Ismaili Muslim tradition. Our tour guide was well-informed and gracious, and we emerged with a feeling of serenity and appreciation for Ismaili culture. To us this was an even better experience than touring the Aga Khan Museum next door. After our tour, we dined at Diwan, within the Museum, and had a delicious though somewhat pricey meal -- which we didn't mind at all because the IC tour was free of charge."

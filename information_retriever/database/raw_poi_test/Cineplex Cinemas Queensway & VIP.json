  "description": "Etobicoke is a relaxed area along the Humber River. It's saturated with green spaces and conservatories, making it a premier destination for outdoor sports, hiking, and nature walks. Its abundance of parkland and lakes makes it a typical spot for fishing, picnicking, and camping out, especially in warmer months. The peaceful area is also enjoyed by families, who appreciate its boardwalks and sports facilities. Locals enjoy the variety of golfing and country club opportunities, which also provide lessons for golfers of any skill level.",

        "We chose to watch Avengers: Endgame in its second weekend at Cineplex Queensway.  I checked out showtimes days earlier and, since reserved seating was available for all screenings, it was a no-brainer to buy tickets online. For this much-anticipated movie, arriving early to buy tickets at the self-serve kiosk or box office would not do as the best seats would be mostly gone. ",
        "When I finally went online Fri afternoon to buy tickets for the 10AM Sat regular screening, most mid- to back-row seats were already taken and the next best adjoining seats I could reserve were seats I19 to I21 (3rd row from the back).  Cineplex no longer requires printed tickets, just show them on your phone (we saved pdf files so no data required). General admission costs $14.99.",
        "This Cineplex location has a huge parking lot and there were plenty of empty spots when we arrived Sat morning. Past the entrance, auditorium #9 is on the left side of the building, first door on the right after the ticket checker. As per seating map, this auditorium seats 279, and has 13 rows total: rows AA-BB nearest the screen, wide aisle then rows A-K.",
        "TimePlay was over when we entered the auditorium at 9:59AM. Movie trailers were shown at 10:10AM. Lights off at 10:19AM and the feature film immediately followed.",
        "Regular screening was satisfactory. Video and audio were both clear. Seating was comfortable enough. We sat in front of D-Box row and we could feel strong vibrations during on-screen action scenes! It was totally unexpected but cool. My only complaint was the sticky floor, obviously no wet mopping done the night before as we were here for the first screening of the day.",
        "This was our family’s first time watching a movie here as we usually go to Cineplex Mississauga. Another thing I like about Cineplex Queensway is that the washrooms are located beside the auditoriums so there is no need to show ticket when going back if you cannot avoid a mid-movie bathroom break."

Its 19 plus so that makes it all the more worth it. Service is first class in the bar/lounge area where you can have a few drinks and snacks or a meal while waiting for your movie. Large tvs to watch your favorite sports too. There is in seat service in the movie theater before the movie. (They will tell you how much time you have left for the service) The atmosphere alone is worth the money for a wonderful night out. The chairs are extremely comfy and the arm rest in the middle can be moved for comfort. The side tables can be swung in and out so that you can snack and eat more comfortably. Washrooms are very clean and well kept. I recommend this 100x over! I do not think I would ever go back to choosing regular seats. This is luxury and comfort for anyone looking for a reasonable night out! Excellent!"

        "The theatre itself is nice leather seats nice dining area but THAT was it.  We arrived an hour before our movie, and  ordered drinks it took 30 minutes after asking 3 times where the beer was. We ordered 2 burgers, 2 wraps and a plate of nachos, the burgers showed up but nothing else.  We kept asking where the rest of the food was, by the time we went in for the movie it still had not arrived, this is  after talking to the waitress the manager  several times and there were aprox 10 people in the eating area only so it wasn't busy.  while we started to watch the movie finally some of the food arrived except for 1 wrap seriously come on - we asked again where it was and the response was oh there was another wrap - rediculous.  In the end we never did get the last wrap and the food delivered to us in the theatre was stone cold. they finally told us that we didn't have to pay for the food and the drinks and gave us free movie passes, which I do appreciate but in the end I will never go back to this location and to be honest paying $50 to see a movie in a bigger seat is really not worth  it.  I would have much more enjoyed just going to the regular theatre getting a popcorn and a coke. And that is what I will do from now on at different location to be sure"

The theaters have nice comfortable seats, and the lightning and look of the theaters is great. I thought the sound was great, and the number of theaters adequate.

        "We watched the new Captain America movie last night. It was a different experience as we've never tried the D-Box seats. For $20.99, your seat is reserved, which is great because we were late. The seats are wider and Red (easier to see in the dark) the only thing I didn't like was they seemed a bit higher and being 5'2\" my feet were swinging a bit too much for my liking. So the seats kind of rumble when there is anything loud on the screen and if you aren't expecting it the first explosion will scare you to death! Even my husband was rocked by the seat! You can adjust the amount of movement in your seat because it can be very distracting not to mention dizzying! Enjoyed the balance of movie with my seat turned off. There are only a few rows of the D-Box seats in the theatre. You also get a ton of leg room in addition to larger seats. Kind of worth it. "

        "For very little extra, VIP movie going is a top-notch option. We particularly like the Cineplex Cinemas Queensway & VIP because it is the only VIP location in Toronto, including the three downtown, that can be reached in less than 10 minutes from downtown, thanks to the QEW highway. Parking is also free, as opposed to downtown locations, and they offer VIP parking to and from the theater entrance for $6. For leisure loving movie goers, the Cineplex Cinemas Queensway & VIP is a great way to go."

        "Terrible Customer Service At Cineplex Queensway VIP",
        "It’s May 19, 2016 at about 12:30am and I just finished watching a movie at this theatre with my husband and a couple of friends. It was a rare night out as for us as we all had small children, and arranging to have babysitters for late night outs can be difficult.",
        "We spent over $150 in the theatre for VIP tickets, food, and drinks. However the whole movie, my husband was waiting for his drink and it never came.",
        "After the movie we went to the concession and told a worker that the drink (which is priced at $10.50) was never delivered. The worker left us for about 5 minutes and another worker came back to tell us that they cannot give us a refund as they are closed but they can give us a $25 voucher which is more than our $10.50 drink. ",
        "Our friend asked if they could give us 2 vouchers instead so that we can at least be able to enjoy as a couple. But the worker said that he can’t make that decision as he is just the mouthpiece and not the manager. So I asked for the manager and my friend asked him to see what he can do.",
        "He left us again for another 5 minutes and returned by himself saying that they were able to open their cash box and refund us the $10.50. He handed the $10.50 to my husband and said that they hope for us to return to the theatre. To which my husband replied, “Not likely.”",
        "We were baffled at the low level of customer service, which is supposed to be a VIP experience. Not only did they take back the $25 voucher that they offered at first and only refund us the price of the drink, but they never apologized for the inconvenience for not delivering the drink, they didn’t refund the tax we paid for the drink, and the manager never bothered to show up to talk to us. Extremely disappointing. Our friends and I could not help but continue to talk about how frustrated we felt about the terrible service."

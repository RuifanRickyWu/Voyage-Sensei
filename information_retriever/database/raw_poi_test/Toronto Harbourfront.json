        "Wow, what a disappointment!  It's just one miss after another along this waterfront. Boring ugly apartment buildings la king any landscaping, leading up to Rogers arena which has got to (be at least on the outside)one of the ugliest baseball stadiums in North America. And then you have the CN Tower which is also just hideous in a painfully brutalist way. And then of course on top of that you have a massive power station.  Boring chain restaurants with zero charm.  They just missed at every turn. ",
        " It looks to me like this was done in the '60s and is definitely a need of a redevelopment. You can see efforts are being made here and there with new restaurants going in, but really it needs a massive redevelopment overhaul. We are from Vancouver and we're expecting something along the lines of the charming Vancouver waterfront near the convention center, or maybe the shipyards near North Vancouver which had an excellent redevelopment and is now a wonderful place to hang out. This is not bad. Long long way to go here."

The waterfront has been built and added onto hodge lodge over the decades and there are nice little bits and pieces but very unfortunately, owing to the wall of condos put up in the 90s and subsequent mediocrity, it's mostly a disjointed mess. Your best bet is to line up at the Soviet-style ferry terminal tucked behind, you guessed it--a condo--and go out to the island. The city also charges richly for this privileged 8 minute ride but you get nice walks and beaches and views once you're out there. The other choice is Leslie Spit on the weekends, which is free and has million dollar views but no beaches."

As a result of the lack of signs and all the blocking structures and ongoing construction which prevented access, am only giving 2 stars due to the difficulty of accessing the waterfront. If the waterfront is something the city wants tourists to be able to enjoy, the city should make it easy for tourists to actually be able to find it and not encounter obstacles wherever they looked.

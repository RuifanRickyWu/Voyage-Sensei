        "I booked a private tour with Sidewalk Tours for some friends visiting from the US. It was a wonderful experience. Catherine, our guide, was knowledgeable and interesting. I expected the good food but did not anticipate learning so much about the history of Kensington and the street art in the area. The only suggestion I would make is that we  did not enjoy the Vegan Cinnamon bun at the end of the tour. With so many wonderful dessert places, we felt there were better options. Otherwise, this reasonably priced tour met all of our expectations. Thank you!"

        "Our family of four went on the tour, this past Saturday.  The guide, Catherine, gave us a lot of tidbits of information,  As it was a busy and noisy Saturday, she would usually try to pull us into an alleyway where it was a lot quieter, so she could tell us about/show us a mural or give us some other bits of info.  We started off the food part of the tour at Global Cheese, with some delicious cheese bites.  We had a lot of munchies, but our all time favourite food was the Jerk Chicken Dumpling at Rasta Pasta and the delicious brownie that we had at Blackbird Bakery.  We tried Bunners (vegan & glueten free) - their cinnamon bun was not something I would want again, but my son had an Oreo muffin there, which he thought was really good.  We also had some dumplings at a Tibetan Restaurant which were good and an interesting  sandwich at a South American Restaurant.  The guide was interesting and kind enough to wait as some of us were a bit late - stuck in Toronto traffic.  I also thought we were given a wide variety of things to eat and things to see, so that made the tour more interesting."

The amount of food were enough for me and I feel very satisfied at the end of the tour. Some of them was a bit spicy but not too much so I think anyone can enjoy. I am thinking about revisiting the restaurant we went."

Our most Speial food moments were cheeses tasting..a üåµ sandwich. The knowledgable guide showed us places and information that we would not notice in bright daylight ..even if we wonderd in the market for hours!!!",

        "Your food tours are my favorite activity in Toronto.  I never knew about such attraction and activity called as a Food tour. It is so much more than just being walked from place to place, eating food and knowing about the history and importance of the Kensington Market. The food is just a medium but you also get to experience the city in a way that goes way below the surface that I scraped on previous visits. These tours make me feel like a true insider! Most recommended tour."

        "Please let my experience serve some purpose (to help you) ‚Äì SKIP this ‚Äúfood‚Äù tour. Having taken over a half dozen food tours in cities all over the world this was, by far, the weakest. It was not only weak ‚Äì it was simply unacceptable. Unlike every other food tour I have experienced, everyone was left hungry. In addition to the experience of being on a food-light food tour, the cultural/historical aspect of the tour was both disappointing and factually inaccurate. Upon completion of the tour, we promtly received an email for feedback with the express mention that if our experience was less than ‚Äúfive star,‚Äù they  would ‚Äúmake it right.‚Äù We wrote a constructive email that expressed the above, and (more than a  2 weeks later) we have not received a response. ",
        "A more detailed review follows:",
        "As locals who often frequent Kensington Market, we thought it would be fun to learn more about this amazing district. The blurb talked about a tour of the history of Kensington Market and the food in the area.",
        "Upon gathering, the friendly tour guide immediately warned/apologized for not having a loud voice. She was not wrong ‚Äì which is a liability for a walking tour through a busy city street tour. We were then notified for the first time that the focus of the tour would be new, up and coming entrepreneurs of the area. That alone is a surprising focus for an area of such history and character. ",
        "The first food stop was Global Cheese. Here we were presented with three ‚Äúlocal, small batch‚Äù Ontario cheeses. The three hard cheeses were completely unremarkable. Being the first stop, we took this as a little warm-up tasting. We then moved across the street to the Mexican restaurant. While I still find it bizarre to stop at one of the newest additions to the market, it was the best stop of the tour. We were given half a sandwich and an interesting rice milk drink.",
        "It is worth noting that we skipped Patty King ‚Äì a true established gem of the area that was, coincidentally, on the review survey. Did the guide forget this stop? How could we miss it?",
        "Then for the next hour or so we engaged in a walking tour that was horrible. Talking about the street art in the market, the guide attempted to incorporate references to Banksy. She was completely wrong about her treatment of the artist and the politics surrounding the most recent exhibit of his art.",
        "Having only had a half a sandwich and a few cubes of cheese on this food tour scheduled over the lunch hours (11 am ‚Äì 2 pm), by the second hour people were hungry. One couple asked the trainee guide (who was trailing the group) for a refund ‚Äì they were talked out of it. In retrospect, I regret not adding my voice to their complaint. As one point, we passed the local bagel shop that was passing out free samples. It was a group joke that we needed to grab free samples because we were all so hungry. ",
        "At one point, the guide stopped in front of the Kiever synagogue. We were on the sidewalk, at the corner of Bellevue park across from the synagogue. Another group of four adults were looking at the building and talking at a reasonable volume some 10 feet away. The guide walked over and asked them to keep their voices down since she was giving a tour. I was shocked and embarrassed ‚Äì hushing a group of people on a sidewalk in front of a public park (who were rightfully taken aback) because you can‚Äôt project your voice to a modest huddle of 8 people!? It only got worse. Explaining to the group why two synagogues were built in this area and what would have precipitated the wave of Jewish immigration ‚Äì she noted the Russian Revolution and Stalin‚Äôs rise to power. Sorry, given that both synagogues were built in 1912 ‚Äì they predate both of these historical events. (The wave of Jewish immigration to Toronto ‚Äì and North America ‚Äì was largely due to the late 19th century czarist Anti-Semitic pogroms. There were several other major inaccuracies but I suspect you get the point.)",
        "Some two hours after the tour began we circled back to a relatively new start up brewery for beer samples of two in-house brews. This was the only time an employee even addressed us. (On food tours, one is often greeted by an owner/manager who explains their establishment.) While sampling these beers, the guide went across the street and returned with small individual take-out boxes from Otto‚Äôs Doner. Despite again being a relatively new addition to the market, it would have been a worthy stop to sample some excellent doners. As the guide passed the small sample boxes out, she explained, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve probably had too much bread by now so here is a sample of the doner‚Äôs filling.‚Äù Seriously? First, how does having a half sandwich nearly two hours prior complete our ‚Äúbread rations.‚Äù Second, serving a doner without the pita completely alters the experience ‚Äì and not for the better. ",
        "Finally, we walked a couple doors down to Wanda‚Äôs (a pie shop). The guide comes out with one strawberry and rhubarb pie and placed it on the table with a pie cutter and made us cut the pie and serve ourselves. Why go to one of the less interesting food places in the market.  Only one pie to try? Cut and serve ourselves?",
        "Even at the lower price compared to other food tours we have taken, this tour was simply unacceptable. I regret not demanding my money back. Save yourself the time and money.       "

I've done 4 food tours and to be fair, the others cost a lot more. I'm cheap, but I would have paid more for a better guide and more food. "

So I thought it would be a good activity to do with my cousin who had never been on a food tour before. We both loved the tour. I had cactus sandwich for the first time in my life. Amazing!

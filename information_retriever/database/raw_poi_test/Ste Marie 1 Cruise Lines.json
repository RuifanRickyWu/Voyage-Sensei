        "My daughter wanted one of her graduation gifts to be a boat ride around the Toronto islands, but we just had a busy summer and never got around to doing it.  September came, warm, sunny, perfect for a boat ride.  We went down to the Harbourfront and boarded our boat with only four other people, a total of 7.  One of the staff told us that they usually require a minimum of 10 passengers to leave the harbour, but they took off anyway - perfect.  The young lady who provided information about the Toronto islands was very pleasant and even offered to take pictures of people on the boat.  The tour is prices slightly lower than most other operators and if, like me, you get it on Groupon you can have this fun experience for close to nothing. We will definitely do it again and will make sure we do it at he end of the season when the boats are not as crowded as they are in July."

So, being the prices the same, we just let ourselves be influenced by the Ste Marie's crew. As soon as we boarded, we noticed there wasn't enough  seats in the upper or front decks, so we had to stay in the lower deck at the back of the back of the boat.

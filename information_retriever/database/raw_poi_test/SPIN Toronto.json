        "A friend of mine who lives in the city introduced me to this place a couple years ago and now I keep finding myself bringing first-timers whenever I can because it's a near-guarantee for a good time. It's smart to book a ping-pong table in advance since the place can be pretty busy (which won't affect your enjoyment when you're there - it's full of energetic life). I usually book the table for an hour (I'd recommend a longer visit if you have more than a couple of people so everyone has enough of a chance to play) and I've found that even people who've never played ping pong or given the idea much thought have a total blast when here. There's a full bar and they do serve food (I've never ordered any since I spend all my time playing) so you could very well make an evening out of your visit."

The staff was fun, friendly and knowledgeable. They have an impressive beer selection, lots of great, local craft beers and the food was so good! I was expecting your typical pub fare (nachos, deep fried food etc) but we had an amazing cheese and charcuterie spread, veggies, vegan dip and some of the best chicken wings I have ever had! The staff also let us know that pretty much everything is made in house using local ingredients. I would highly recommend SPIN to anyone and definitely want to go back!"

The food was brought out as appetizers and surprisingly really good, lots of welcome items like shrimp and tomato skewers with Old Bay, beef sliders, and some very nice dips and charcuterie.  The bar was attentive and we really just had a lot of laughs and played ping pong.  Music was not too loud and lighting just right.

        "We've been talking about going to SPiN for ages - a fun atmosphere to play table tennis (or, Ping Pong, if you prefer) in Toronto. I'm so glad we finally made it happen. You can reserve a table but we opted to go the drop-in route because it's less expensive, and we're impulsive. We lucked out and got a table right away. Paddles and balls are provided (hard core ping pongers - or whatever they call themselves -like my husband can bring their own). The atmosphere had a very cool, laid back vibe that begs you to stay all day (or all evening) and hang out. This place would be great for a first date or a 10th anniversary. The people are very friendly and although they do have competitions (drop in Sunday afternoon at 1pm) it's not a competitive atmosphere. So whether you're a champ like my husband or an amateur like me (I'm happy just to make contact with the ball!) you'll feel welcome and have a great time. They also have a tempting menu that's very reasonably priced and a bar, for limitless fun. What would make it better? A chance run in with Susan Sarandon, who is part owner - she's the epitome of cool, which explains why SPiN has cool mastered. By the way, don't make the same faux pas as my husband - sniffing balls is never cool, even if said balls are broken table tennis balls. LOL.  Go to SPiN - you'll love it! "

        "Have been there a couple of times already, so the place is not new to me. You can play ping pong/ table tennis on minimum  12 tables that I counted on site or just chill out at the bar. You can either play a tournament amongst your friends or just hit the ball for fun. ",
        "They have a basket of balls nearby and you don’t have to pick up any fallen balls as people around quickly “sweep” them. The only complaint I have is there are spots that are too dark and the spots that are lighted are dim, particularly when you first enter. You have to get used to the lights. Perfect for a bar or lounge, but not as much for playing and chatting with people around.  ",
        "The food served was good - on a platter all finger foods. There was a small sign in each of the picnic table where the food was, but sometimes difficult to read and also which dishes which were which. Two dips in platters and one had dairy and one did not. ",
        "But a good experience overall as the staff were helpful. "

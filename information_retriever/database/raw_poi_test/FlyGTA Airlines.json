The pilots are super friendly, customer support is super responsive and boarding the plane is so fast! The flight itself was fast (about 35 minutes in the air), the seats were comfortable, and best of all, you get to your destination in a 1/3 of the time it takes the train! It's by far the best way to get to Kingston from Toronto!"

        "Our air tour took us over Lake Ontario, going east to Scarborough Bluffs and then back towards the city, north of the downtown core. We went as far west as Little Italy and then circled downtown. One more trip around the islands and it was back to the airport. Smooth flight all around!",
        "Although the weather was sunny, it was quite a bit hazy at times, depending on the angle. I did manage to get some decent images out of the 700+ shots though. I just posted a small sample here.",
        "Going on this flight brought back memories of when I worked as a photographer, traveling to cities in the US and Canada, capturing images for postcards, calendars, and other souvenir items. Back then, digital cameras weren't around, so I'd have three cameras loaded with film, and a limited number of shots. Thank goodness for digital! Most of my flights in those days were in a helicopter with the doors removed for the clearest shots! I miss those days.",

I flew St.Catharine's Niagara Regional Airport to the island in May 2019.  The flight was so easy compared to train and/or bus or even driving the boring highway only to sit in Toronto traffic once approaching from the west.   So, now I am trying the new Kingston to Toronto service later this week.   Should be fun if we don't get snowed in!   The only negative is the poor web site:  googling to get the real website we were lead to a similar one for a \"Curly Airlines\" but that soon became obvious as a test site of some sort.  I know FlyGTA are trying so giving the benefit of the doubt.  They've also been great to deal with over the phone.   Very friendly and well-organized."

You go out of the building, and across the turn-around driveway further ahead you’ll see a small building with “STOLPORT” sign. You walk over there and speak to an agent inside who will help you check in and lead you to a small waiting lounge. Oh, since they are chartered flights. they don’t have those unpleasant security checks! We were the only passengers and we were there 40 minutes before the departure. Since we were all ready, they even departed early for us.",
        "They don’t have tons of luggage space but they do take suitcases (they put them in the “nose” of the airplane or the back of the cabin). The small 8-seater plane is “well-loved” so if you expect a swanky private jet you might be a little disappointed, but we thought it was quaint. It is just so wonderful to be able to fly direct to Kingston from downtown Toronto - takes only 40-45 minutes one way. I definitely see the need for this as it is fast, convenient, relatively private, fun and easy to fly.",
        "The building (both STOLPORT at Toronto Billy Bishop and Norman Rogers in Kingston) are fully accessible, but the airplane is a tiny 8-seater, so you will need to be able to climb up/down a small ladder to get on/off the plane. They won’t rush you so you can take time getting on/off if you need extra time.",

        "I’m a fan of aviation. I love to fly. I don’t know the intimate details and distinctions between DC-8 engine types, but exploring different aircraft types is always exciting. Sometimes this happens quite deliberately – I seek specific aircraft types out – and other times it happens, shall we say, by accident. This latter instance probably best describes how I happened upon FlyGTA and their Piper PA-31 aircraft. I was in the Niagara region on a bit of personal business and didn’t want to take a shuttle or bus all the way back into the GTA. It just takes up such a precious amount of time. And so, one morning, I decided to do a bit of random browsing online, thinking “there must be a faster way!” And voila! FlyGTA populated my search engine screen. The best part? The one-way flight was less than $100 AND took less than 15 minutes! In terms of value and convenience, this definitely trumps driving or taking a bus.",
        "I made my way to the Niagara District airport. The flight was delayed due to low-lying cloud and a bit of stormy weather, but nevertheless arrived. After the lone passenger disembarked the aircraft at Niagara, we boarded the Piper PA-31 – there were a whopping two passengers on this flight, myself included. In essence, it was almost like flying a private plane into the GTA. What could be cooler than that? Oh! I know! How about adding a new aircraft type to my list? That’s what happened here as I’d never flown the PA-31 up to this point. Okay, that was just the icing on the proverbial cake.",
        "The flight itself was good, albeit a bit bumpy. The crew was professional and helpful throughout. The only aspect I found a bit disappointing was that, due to the clouds, there was nothing to see while in the air. It would’ve been nice to see Lake Ontario from above; however, the lack of scenery wasn’t FlyGTA’s fault. That’s just how the weather was behaving.",
        "Upon arrival at Billy Bishop, the crew again demonstrated their commitment to a high level of customer service and satisfaction: I was assisted from the terminal and pointed in the direction of Toronto proper. In many ways, the level of service reminded me of Pacific Coastal Airlines – very personable and down to earth, unlike our national flag carrier.",
        "If you’re looking for an affordable and convenient option to commute between Toronto and the surrounding region, FlyGTA provides excellent value in this regard. They have a solid safety record, great staff and are intimately familiar with southern Ontario. Indeed, this is exactly what you’d want in a regional carrier."

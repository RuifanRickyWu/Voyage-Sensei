Customer service could be improved, but I have never had any major issues with them. Room design is always extremely immersive and filled with interesting puzzles to solve. You can tell they have a big budget when designing these rooms."

      "text": [
        "first of all, I would like to point out that I have completed 50+ escape games and am a game master at another escape room. I LOVE escape rooms and have left plenty of raving reviews for amazing escape rooms and Omescape was recommended by customers where I work. I read some reviews about the great rooms but some issues with rude or careless staff - hoped it was a few off experiences or grumpy guests and went in with an open mind expecting nothing but a great time :) ",
        "Came with family (who also have done many escape rooms) for Mothers Day and did \"Kingdom of Cats\". Staff were not aware I was someone working at highly rated escape room, so it was an average experience, nothing special, but I mean they barely interacted with us to begin with, see below. It was very interesting, unique layout and fun puzzles, not surprisingly we finished with 30 mins remaining and used 1 hint. I enjoyed the room as a whole, it was fun enough. ",
        "Where this became disappointing was the staff and the general flow and atmosphere of the experience. It felt like bare minimum was done for us. we were shown a video in the middle of the lobby, nothing was explained (locks we will see and if linear/non linear) both pretty standard things to know across the industry, but hey maybe they just don't do that - but of the 50+ companies I've experienced, that was a first for neither to be explained. If it was my first escape room, I would be confused, wouldn't be impressed, and it would make me not want to try another one, anywhere, if I got this minimal amount of explanation or care from the staff. ",
        "When we completed the room, the final puzzle and opened the final door, we were met by... no one, a dark hallway. Escape rooms are exciting, completing the final puzzle should be exciting - 95% of the time of completing a room, you are met at least by an applauding staff member, a message of congratulations over walkie/screen, or a combination of the two. To open a door into a dark hallway where we were met by no one, no message, nothing, knocked it from \"yes we did it!\" to \"okay... now what, are we done??\" we felt abandoned by the staff. We ended not where we started, so we weren't familiar with what to do. We walked up to the front desk, found 3 staff sitting there, ON THEIR CELL PHONES, and watching screens. I spoke up and said \"mhmm, sorry how much time did we finish with?\" to get their attention to us, where they kinda looked around lost and one guy said \"exactly 30 minutes\", again, very monotone, no excitment, just the amount of effort minimum. This was also during the raptors playoff game, so we think they may have been focused on that instead of their job. I can't tell them how to run their business or how to have personality, but I would hope for the money I spent, I would get at least a decent experience and shown respect and care from the staff. ",
        "We went to their photo stage, took a picture, and were told to have a good night. that's it. bare minimum conversation, no personable touch by any staff, nothing. The difference between a good experience and a great or exceptional one is 100% the staff and how engaging and personable they are. period. ",
        "It's unfortunate because the staff of where I work frequently take \"field trips\" all together to have a fun day off trying other escape rooms together, and this was high on our list, and now I think it will be removed.",
        "The room was fun and unique for sure, but I can't get past how much the atmosphere and staff effect the experience, and with my experience on both guest and game master side, it was the lowest I've seen. Hopefully sometime in the future we can give it a second chance or try the other location."

Clearly get there at least 20mins beforehand so you can complete form and check in using different social media outlets to get $3/person (each person has to do it in order to get $3 off).  ",

There is an instructional video prior to being led into the room.  You get blinds as they lead you to the game room.  You also get a walkie talkie to ask for unlimited hints from the staff.",
        "The overall experience wasn't too bad; we all had fun.  We have 2 suggestions: A. to put actual instructions in the room to help understand what has to be solved.  Once you take off your blinds after listening to the story line; we're left to scramble and make sense of what is in the room to proceed.  Despite the walkie talkie; we didn't find it too helpful because at times, it get very static which makes it difficult to hear what the hint is given to us.  Even the staff has a difficult time to hear the questions we asked.  Because of that, we find time ticking away.  B. Perhaps improve the lighting a little since it is quite dim and sort of makes the task difficult (yes, we're aware it is supposed to be as realistic as possible)."

(The other three were not our cup of tea - I do not enjoy dark/dim rooms, or rooms where you are handcuffed.  However, the increased difficulty level intrigued us.)  We liked the fact that they rated their rooms for difficulty.  Our team of three (2 adults and 1 child) tackled \"The Kingdom of Cats\" and \"Project Sphere\" after a ~4 hour drive down to Markham after work.  (see below for comments regarding the rooms we played)",

        "The room was a comfortable size with good lighting. The room & decor were of high quality.  There was some climbing involved in one section, but I think young kids would be able to climb it safely with some parental supervision.  One area had lower ceilings, but it did not feel claustrophobic.  There was a good variety and quantity of puzzles, some quite unique.  The was a good balance between mechanical, mathematical, logical and observational puzzles.  They were mostly intuitive.  Overall this room was quite enjoyable.  Only one puzzle felt like a chore, but after calling for a hint, the gamemaster suggested a different way of solving it, which helped a bit (along with a bit of trial and error for the one part that suggestion didn't work for).  This is definitely a family-friendly escape room, and could be done with kids as young as 9 or 10.  I think it would be a good room for first-time escapers.   My daughter loved all the cat stuffies!   The long skinny one was her favourite!  (Gamemaster:  where can we find/buy one of those?)  We completed this room with about 15 minutes to spare.  After having done about 35 escape rooms in three different cities, this room would rank in our top five favourites!  It is one of the most creative rooms we've seen to date.",

        "The room was a comfortable size; only one section was a bit tighter, but not claustrophobic.  The lighting was good overall, but there was a small section with slightly dimmer lighting.  The room & decor were of medium-high quality.  Crawling was required by one or two members of the team, and it was amusing watching them army-crawl past the obstacle.  Again there was a good variety and quantity of puzzles, though some of them were less intuitive.  It was a enjoyable room, though we disliked having to run/crawl back and forth to solve one of the puzzles.  This room would be suitable for families with kids that are a bit older (about 12/13 or older).  I would consider this a more challenging room.  We completed the room seconds before the time limit.  Overall, this room would rank in the middle tier of the rooms we've done.  (The theme/back story is a common one among escape rooms... I actually got it mixed up with another escape room and was confused as to how the decor was supposed to tie into the story... oops!!!  made a lot more sense when I finally figured it out :o) )"

Both times the people at the front desk were always kind and accommodating and they give out as many hints as you want/need. With the larger group of friends we attempted The Penitentiary which we could not complete and we found to be quite challenging even though it has a 4/5 rating. Mostly because we were kind of running around aimlessly. I will say this room has a lot of ropes and you are separated into two groups at the beginning of this room. With the smaller group of four we actually did the Joker's Asylum where the minimum number of players is five but they let us play if we just paid for the extra missing person. This game was 5/5 but we managed to complete it with one less person even though the difficulty was much harder. This game also separates the group at the beginning and if you're easily spooked this game might not be for you as the sounds played throughout the game were a little bit creepy. Both games consisted of moving throughout 2+ rooms and for the price, the experience is quite frankly unbeatable. The rooms are unique and I left both times with a great experience with my friends!"

The variety and style of puzzles are challenging but very fun. They do a great job with the setup of the rooms too. We will definitely be back, and look forward to trying their other location in Scarborough."

Staff is very helpful and friendly, and the rooms are full of interesting and elaborate puzzles. Difficult to escape, but they do offer unlimited clues!  Its a cool experience for any age group -  I would definitely come back again."

        "Our escape group of 4 is intermediate level, having done about 7-8 rooms together. The Omescape rooms are several steps ahead of anything we've done in aesthetic, design, concept and tech. They are beautiful and detailed multi-room designs with many exciting surprises. They are also F#@^ing hard! We have done two 3/5 difficulty rooms and run out of time on the final few puzzles. This last time I asked what the success rate was on the room we had just failed.. he said 15%. So 15 out of 100 groups escape, and that is 3/5!? You have been warned! If escaping if important to you, work your way up to 3/5."

The things we kept discovering as we made our way through the spaces had us cheering the whole time. SO much fun! Would highly recommend and I look forward to doing their other rooms!",

What really impressed my kids was what they called the \"special features\" like mechanized objects such as trap doors and moving walls. They also liked that the room they tried had \"verticality\" in the forms of stairs and crawl spaces. The staff was great, too."

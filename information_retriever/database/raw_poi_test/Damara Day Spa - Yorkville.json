        "Staff was friendly and patient. As this was a unique and new experience for my husband and I we were treated kindly, respectfully and were ensured comfort, intimacy, and privacey. Therapists took the time to explain and ask permission prior to performing the Swedish massage. They were intuitive and conversed with us and made us feel at home.  They often checked that we were comfortable and took care to adjust technique as needed for personnal preference. The Luxury for Two package was an amazing deal  and experience for us.  After traveling it was much needed for relaxation. "

        "Horrific experience at Novo Spa. This was supposed to be a super relaxing birthday spent at the spa and turned out to be the most unpleasant experience. DO NOT COME HERE! There are literally a million other more qualified spas in the city of Toronto. My boyfriend booked me a full day spa at this ridiculous establishment and even though the services were fine, the experience at the end ruined the whole day that was meant to be a treat. When my boyfriend booked he gave whoever took the reservation his credit card information, because this was a gift. When I go to hand in the keys, I was told that I had to pay for the bill. I inform the lady in reception that this is supposed to be a gift, she says it hasn‚Äôt been paid for yet and tells me the price owed. I inform her that I heard my boyfriend give his cc info and she just couldn‚Äôt be bothered to listen and just wanted to be paid the money. Not bothering to find a solution like call my bf that made the reservation, to get his cc info for the authorized payment, or call him to clarify the misunderstanding. Just totally rude with a horrific attitude that should not be working in the service industry. A bill over $500 and you don‚Äôt have the decency to treat customers with respect. I will not be returning to this establishment and anyone reading this shouldn‚Äôt either, do not waste your money, there are much better spas with actual good service all around the city. I called my boyfriend upset after the incident and he called the spa to rectify the situation and got hung up on, for a better idea on how customers are treated here. He tried calling back and no one picked up. To management the girl at reception that took my payment is the worst person to be working in the service industry, reconsider her employment as she‚Äôs taking money away from your business. I‚Äôll be spreading the news to any and all friends and colleagues. Instead of leaving relaxed and calm after a full day at the spa I left agitated and upset, thanks Novo Spa and thank you for the garbage service at reception."

While it is standard to fill out a health form we were not informed we had to do so beforehand or that we could do it online. Thus the extra fifteen minutes that we were told could be used to go into a sauna was needed to fill out the health form. The front desk staff just to say acknowledged our presence, I even had to be the one who offered my friend a glass of water. It was funny and we giggled because it felt like we were doing the front desk jobs. When we had trouble with the iPad, we ended up figuring it out instead of the front desk coming over and offering to assist us, despite us clearly articulation questions outloud. The massage therapist were very good and the place was very clean. It does have a relaxing atmosphere. Especially when you're lounging in the chairs. But would I go back? Maybe. I haven't decided yet."

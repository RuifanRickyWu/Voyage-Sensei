Once inside the room, the players must use imagination, logical thinking,and teamwork to solve the tricky clues that are hidden about the room. Only by solving these clues can they obtain the codes to unlock the doors an escape!",

Even though the two locations are owned by different people, the lovely lady at the desk was able to access our booking, cancelled it - as we would no longer be able to make it - and gave us a discount on the Chainsaw Massacre room to offset the deposit we had paid, and we only had to wait 50 minutes until we could do a room.",
        "The entrance had seating and games such as connect 4 and Jenga, but it is a requirement that you remove your shoes upon entry which may be difficult for some people.",
        "The room itself was slightly disappointing. Some of the clues were disjointed and would have been impossible to deduce without hints for anyone. Overall, the room was styled well, but while I would recommend it for people who are new to escape rooms, it was a little disappointing to our family who have participated in a few really cool escape rooms."

        "I have been wanting to do an escape room with my colleagues for years. Finally did one with 3 of us with our spouses. We did Black Beard's Curse! It was a great experience with multiple rooms! The puzzles were tricky, but not impossible so it was very rewarding to figure them out.  My only critique is that the puzzle was rather linear. Like, you knew exactly what you had to figure out, so, with 6 people, only a few of us were doing all the puzzles while the others were sort of wandering around looking for other things.  I would say 4 people is perfect for this one.",

I've been paired with some dead-weight groups before at other escape rooms and really brings down the experience.

        "The first room had clues which didn't make much sense, so we had to ask for her help 3 times. We were stuck in there for 20 minutes, not because it was too challenging, but because it didn't really add up. We figured out the clue, but she had to tell us that the numbers were off because of the interpretation of the clue, which didn't make sense. There was one decent clue after that, but the rest of the rooms were so easy, it was comical. The answers were practically written right there for you. After our 20 minutes in the first room, we finished the remainder in under 15 minutes.",

One of the borrowed phones wouldn't scan resources and so that player \"died\" very early on and the staff couldn't reactivate their character.  Scanning the bar codes required you to use a flashlight on another phone as the ambient light in the room was insufficient for the scanner to work.",

The young man at the front desk was friendly and did his best to make our time enjoyable but was overwhelmed and so didn't explain the setup terribly well.  Consequently we also used an emergency exit to inadvertently circumvent part of the game to get into a subsequent room."

        "Read the very mixed reviews about this game, but decided to try it out, as we had a couple of hours to spare one morning and this was the only escape game in Toronto that opened early on a weekday. The rooms and props were very tatty and tacky and far too many of the props were off limits, so there weren't enough props for our group of 6 to explore. When we asked for a hint or clue at one point the employee came in and just told us where the key was. This immediately put an end to that section of the game. We all lost interest very quickly and were glad when the game was over. Extremely poor quality compared to the 2 previous escape games we played in Germany. Would hate for anyone else to waste their money and be as disappointed as us!"

Also, the worker walked in several times to mention things to us...which we found very unprofessional.  We had an hour to escape and were done with 20 minutes to spare...which says something about the little amount that is put into this room.  There should be way more to solve.

We did the Tomb explorer and we had a lot of fun that we wanted to try another escape room the following day; however, we wanted to try a different location to get a different experience. Loved the multi-room escape because there's a feeling of accomplishment when you can escape one room and go into another. There was one really cool tech, that we all love. We did escape with hints, but it was so much fun. The sound system should have been louder. Overall, we really enjoyed our experience. Props 7/10, Service 9/10, "

First off, the rooms are so open and poorly sound proofed that if there is another group there completing a different game it feels like they are in the room with you, it can become very disrupting and can throw you off focus!! The rooms are in bad shape and in definite need of some paint. A shelf in one of the rooms (that had nothing to do with the game) fell off and struck one of my friends square in the head! Also, we were with a group of 6 and booked 2 rooms, costing us 240$ combined so an intro video with some sort of story background would've been nice, Lastly, I don't mind the addition of some \"red herrings\" but there were just way too many switches, buttons, room accessoires that had NOTHING to do with the puzzle. It doesn't take much to hide these or at least mark them off properly!! okay i feel better now! AND ANOTHER THING The puzzles themselves were not bad and I didn't mind the difficulty,(though there was more math than I wouldv'e liked) Just small things that can be easily changed to make them stand out among top escape rooms!"

When we asked for a hint, they realized they screwed up, and snuck back in to slip the clue in (when we didnt ask them to for a hint). Worst experience ever. Don't go here!!"

We were given extra time as it took forever for someone to come to help with the clues as it started with only one worker there who was greeting new people and also having to handle the rooms. All in all we definitely would return. We really did have a blast. Just they should ensure extra staff on weekends. "

Never been to an escape room before and thought it would be fun. And maybe if we had gone elsewhere it would have been. This place is so lame I would not go back for free. Hated it. Seriously I have a hard time believing any positive reviews for this place are legit. "

There are lots of high tech puzzels and equipments in the game. That's super exciting. I also like the multiple rooms, we nned go though 4 rooms and unlock 5 doors in order to escape. We made it in 54 mins. Staffs are very nice, they helped us take funny pictures. As a group of 6, we all had good experiences. We highly recomend go and have a try. You will like it!"

I believe this location was still under construction at the time, so we had to run across the street to make a payment. A bit inconvenient, but not much of a hassle. ",
        "When we went into the room, the receptionist briefed us on the storyline - your fiancee has been kidnapped and you have one hour to save her. The room was made to look like a hotel room and they did a very good job setting it up. Furniture was somewhat outdated (perhaps it was supposed to be a low budget inn?) but the overall setting was nice. The technical components provided an excellent touch - there was a TV that showed us surveillance sequences and clips so it it seemed like you were watching a character in the game in real time, which was an excellent feature. We had a couple technical difficulties with the phone prop, however nothing that ruined the experience.",
        "Even though we did not manage to escape in time, we all has such a blast working together solving the puzzles. The theatrical features were nice and it truly made you feel like you were immersed in the storyline."

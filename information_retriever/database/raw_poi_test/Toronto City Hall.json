Its unique design has two uneven curved office towers embracing an oyster-shaped domed council chamber raised above Nathan Phillips Square which is home to hundreds of celebrations, art shows and ice skating on the frozen reflecting pool. Designed to allow a space for the people of the city to gather and celebrate like the Raptors’ NBA win. Also a great place to stroll the length of the truck food vendors and breathe in the smell of freshly fried potatoes and poutine and the ever-popular street hot dog. Its New Years’ Eve party is not to be missed. It is famous for banning the group Barenaked Ladies which rather than harming the success of the group it gave it tons of free publicity and paved the way for its future success."

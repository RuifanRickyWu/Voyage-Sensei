I felt afraid for my safety. When I arrived he put on his sunglasses and got out and opened the door very aggressively. Highly do not recommend this service. 0/10"

Richard displayed such amazing knowledge of the vehicle and comparisons to other high end vehicles and readily answered all of our questions.

I usually travel with my friends and family so i needed a vehicle that could accommodate 4 adults. I called Evolve Limousine and they told me their whole fleet was electric, so cool! I booked a full size sedan but hey upgraded my booking from a Tesla Model S to Model X at no charge because I was a first time customer. We were picked up in a spacious SUV with the falcon doors that go up looking like wings. The ride was smooth, comfortable and so luxurious. Our driver was very friendly and demonstrated all the interesting features of the car. I got to say that I will only be booking with Evolve Limousine because of their 5 star service and their electric vehicles which are good for their clients and the environment. Thanks Again Evolve Limousine!"

Our flight was delayed a couple of hours but Evolve kept up to date with our timings, Richard (our driver), let me know where he was parked and as soon as we walked out of the doors, he noticed us and put our bags in the back whilst we settled ourselves into the Tesla. Richard was so welcoming, extremely helpful and gave us recommendations on where to eat and what to do. He went absolutely above and beyond… as our flight was delayed, we only had approx 1 hour to get to the hotel and then to the Scotiabank arena for the Leafs game. He could tell we were panicking so he offered to wait outside the hotel for us and then take us directly outside the arena!!! This helped us massively otherwise we could have missed the first game! Honestly, if it wasn’t for Richard then I don’t know what we would have done. He was amazing from start to finish. If I ever come back to Toronto then I will 100% be asking for him as my driver again!!"

We had never been in a Tesla before and had organised transfers from and to the airport and a trip Niagara Falls. We had Richard as our driver for our entire trip. He was amazing and knowledgeable about Toronto and surrounding areas and was helpful in recommending places to visit. Also happy to take us anywhere we wished. Highly recommend."

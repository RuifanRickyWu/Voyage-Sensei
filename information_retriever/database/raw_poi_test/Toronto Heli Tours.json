The flight was very short, and to make matters worse, we weren‚Äôt allowed to take our own photos beside the helicopter. Instead, only their photographer could take pictures, and she only took one quick shot for each photo without checking if our poses looked good. When we picked up the print, I was shocked to see that my eyes were closed, but when I asked for a retake, she refused! If I‚Äôd known the photos would turn out so poorly, I would have just saved my money and booked the cheaper, regular flight. Definitely wouldn‚Äôt recommend; not worth the price at all."

I will just cut 1 star because when we got our official photograph taken by the camera person infront of the helicopter.... we saw the photo on the tv screen and we really liked it.... so we agreed to pay $10 digital for the photo happily... But when we received the photo.... it was totally dark and the automatic photoshop colors that they had shown on the screen dissappeared from the photo... it was totally dark... When the lady at the counter tried to download it again from their photoshop feature... it saved without the colors and editing... It is a waste to buy the photo if it doesnt come with the natural editing on its own... No use then buying a dark photo as no matter what you do... your own iPhone pro max cant put those colors and brightness no matter how much you try. Please do fix this issue. Rest everything was absolutely amazing. Must try !!!!!"

Not on this helicopter - the windows were crystal clear and we got some great shots. Our lady pilot was very professional and we saw everything we wanted to during the flight. The ground crew were very pleasant and helpful too. You are normally only allowed to take a small camera or smartphone with you, but the let me take my heavy SLR. We did the romantic jewel tour, which included a photo by the helicopter. I would recommend these guys to anyone visiting Toronto. We'll be back!"

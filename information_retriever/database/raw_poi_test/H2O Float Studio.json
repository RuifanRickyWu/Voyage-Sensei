  "description": "Welcome to H2O Float Studio in Toronto's Historic Distillery District. Experience a level of total relaxation that you have to feel to believe! Melt into a serene experience of weightlessness and tranquility, restoring balance to the mind and body. Float in one of our Cabins, where the temperature of the water and air are maintained at a constant 34 degrees Celsius. As this is the body's normal skin surface temperature, it creates a feeling of oneness with the water. Our Float Cabins each contain over 1000 pounds of the highest quality of Epsom Salt dissolved in 10 inches of water. The water is circulated and filtered 24/7. Although the 1000+ pounds of Epsom Salt is already extremely sanitizing, the water also passes through a UV and an Ozonator filter.",

To end the conversation, she offered a perfunctory apology followed by muttering under her breath. When I said, pardon, she responded by saying she was talking to herself."

I decided to purchase this package after seeing a woman on tik tok review this same package. I was getting married and decided to purchase the package a few days before my wedding so I can truly reset and relax before the big day. I never really had a self care routine, or understood the importance of a self care routine until attending the Float and Glow package.",
        "The staff at H20 were so accommodating and easy going. They really make you feel calm and ready to go even before you start the treatment! The float tank was something I was super nervous to do. Sitting still for an hour is something I just can’t do, or have never tried. The cabins are gorgeous. The showers and toiletries they provide you are incredible. I could spend hours in their showers. The hour I spent in the float tank was life changing. I don’t think I have ever experienced anything like that before. You are truly relaxed and numb to any outside stresses. It takes a bit for your body to adjust but once you just let go it becomes an experience that you realize you need regularly in your life. ",
        "Once my float was over (I was so bummed out) I went to have my facial. I have cystic acne so I was a little worried that the treatment would cause a flare up. It was quite the opposite. I haven’t had a flare up since my treatment (it's been almost 2 weeks). My skin has never glowed like it has since the facial. It was such a nice experience. Stella did my facial and she was so personable and I felt I really connected with her. She really made me realize I needed to do more things like this for my self care routine.",

Now I’m normally someone who suffers from claustrophobia, so I was a little nervous going in. But once in the float tank, you feel so safe and secure. No room for fear. I got the 90min facial too & Stella was incredible. My face is literally glowing, my body feels like heaven.

The staff I spoke to were nice and said that they would increase the temperature to the maximum allowed for safety, but I did not really feel any difference. I remained in the float but did not feel relaxed during my time inside the cabin. I emailed the company to see whether this is normal but no-one replied. I would not recommend this to anyone who feels the cold easily."

        "The spa is clean and serene, but to be honest I feel that should be Standard Operating Procedure for a spa, not something I give \"extra points\" for. The staff member asked my shoe size upon arrival to give me a pair or shoes. \"Size 8\" I said cheerfully. She proceeded to give me a pair of size 8. Mens. *ahem*. I had to shuffle back and switch them out myself for a pair that fit.",
        "Then came the obligatory 5 page health and wellness form to fill out before the massage. Why do we do this ? I have YET to go to *any* spa where they look at these forms. The massage was great, but I feel I could have written I had all manner of diseases and ailments on that form and no one would have read it. The RMT just asks \"So what are we working on today ?\" H2O is not alone in this approach, but again... what's the point of these forms if no one reads them ? I suppose it's for insurance purposes.",
        "After the massage, the float tank was introduced and a very prelim verbal explanation given of the controls, but no one actually shows you how to use them. But how hard could it be anyway ? I thought. Well... kind of hard. The volume & light controls have no read-outs /lights to indicates if you're increasing / decreasing stuff so I faffed about for quite a while before I figured out exactly what settings worked for the lights and sound.",
        "I did float. My upper right neck and shoulder twitched as the Epsom salts released tension so that was nice. But the water was *barely* warm at best, and the ear plugs meant that my \"rainforest experience\" sounded like muffled construction or transit noises. ",
        "Basically my float experience was like sitting in a tepid bath, while the TTC subway roared underneath me.",

I floated around, not warm, staring at the LED lights in the ceiling, listenting to the erstwhile \"rainforest\" / TTC noises mumbling to myself \"When does this get relaxing ?\" for about 45 mins. Then I just got fed up with how uncomfortable I was, and got out of the tank before the session ended. I couldn't wait to have a hot shower to warm up!",

        "I did enjoy listing to 80's music, and it was surreal to hear the 'Stranger Things' theme song with a red glow inside. The experience is even better when you close your eyes and submerge your ears (with ear plugs). You can hear the music through the water, and see the red glow through your eyelids, while floating in very densely salted water. I felt like I was in the 'upside down!' ",

However, it was not too cool for me, as some reviews have indicated. My temperature inside was quite good. ",

From the moment we entered the studio is was warm and inviting and we felt a sense of calm instantly. The staff were lovely and ensured we were well looked after throught the process. The float tank was the largest I’d ever seen and we both fit comfortably together. The float under the soft green lights with rainforest music was the most calming experience and a great escape from the kids! I had the best night sleep that evening. We can’t wait to come back."

Not comfortable or relaxing. Even tried without pillow. I had a stubborn headache for days after. Inexperienced staff. I wouldn't  purchase package outright. Their site ONLY spotlights their perceived good without the many many downsides.  I strongly DO NOT recommend this overblown hyped up service."

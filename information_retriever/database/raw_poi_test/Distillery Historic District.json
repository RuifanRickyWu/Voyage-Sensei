These have now been converted into a very pleasant attraction with a number of restaurants, bars and shops. If the weather is good, there are plenty of places to sit outside. This is a good location for buying gifts, for example jewelry, candles, etc."

It was so beautiful to walk around & take in the historical beauty of the buildings while enjoying shopping. Very clean & easy to navigate! Easy street parking a couple blocks over & very easy to walk around. Some highlights of our Distillery visit includes Balazacs coffee shop, street vendors, reading about the buildings history & taking photos of the beautiful buildings! Loved the vibe here & was so happy we made time for this during our Toronto visit!"

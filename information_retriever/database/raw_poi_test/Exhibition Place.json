I recommend Alijandro’s Fawaffle Avo Chicken or vegan original cones ($12, 10). Masks can be purchased ($2) and sanitizer is available for eating on the greens, facing the breakwaters on the other side of Lakeshore. Limited outdoor seating means you should arrive 1:00-1:30 to grab a table. Washrooms are available and entrance is free (payments contactless). Vendors do not sell drinks. Beer is available on site separately for sale. Families should bring tetra drinks, and maybe sunscreen. Entrance off Lakeshore is just West of Ontario Place."

        "Friday November 1st 2019. My children and I went to the Royal Agricultural Winter Fair for a second year in a row. We love animals so we enjoy seeing all the different farm animals and that you can get up close and touch most of them. I like the educational aspect and being able to read about the different types/breeds of animals. We watched the Super Dogs Show which we loved and found it very entertaining, we also watched the sheep herding demonstration which was a little slow at times and a bit repetitive, but was great to see once. ",
        "We also paid extra for the evening horse show which was also opening night. It was very entertaining and great to watch. We absolutely loved the RCMP Musical Ride! It was amazing and I would definitely watch again! ",
        "We ate lunch, which was mediocre and very pricey, especially after paying the entry fee plus the horse show tickets it ends up being a very expensive day out, but not quite worth the money. ",
        "We also visited the Pizza Pizza Petting Zoo which my kids really love, but after this visit I will not be returning. I got a very sour taste in my mouth after the owner(I believe) of the petting zoo yelled at my daughter for feeding a few strands of hay to one of the goats. He told her not to do it, which my daughter of course felt terrible and came running back to me feeling awful. But then he proceeds to follow her and then continue his tantrum of why she shouldn’t feed them the hay (which he admits that it is his hay to feed them at night) because we have to pay for the food that they supply. I just spent almost $25 on those cups of food because my kids love the petting zoo so much, to have the owner speak to my daughter as if she is a criminal, telling her if he catches her again he will have her thrown out of the area! Let me be clear she only fed one goat, a few strands of hay. She was not going around feeding multiple animals!!!! And my daughter is 11 years old! She was in tears! An 11 year old girl who adores animals and would never do anything to harm them! This man was more concerned about his wallet being affected than anything else! VERY poor taste, and shame on him! So his need to cause a big scene and feel all mighty and powerful over a child has left us with a poor experience and will not be returning! You spend that kind of money there to be left with that kind of experience, not worth it!"

        "My family and I have been going to the CNE every summer for as long as I can remember. I haven't been to the CNE in the past few years, so I wasn't really sure what to expect from the CNE 2019. This year, there was no more ice skating events to watch, and there were, in a way, less events/programs happening. We only went to the CNE for their shows this time around. The ILL-Abilities Dance Crew was pretty good. The Food Truck Frenzy was okay. Near the Food Truck Frenzy were a few trucks giving away free samples. The Under $6 in the 6 food trucks were disappointing. Thought there would be at least 12 food trucks in the area. The Godzilla, or the activity known as Chill with Zill was disappointing. We thought that there was an actual recreation of Godzilla somewhere near or on the CNE grounds. It was just an inflatable balloon version of Godzilla. Rather it looked like a flimsy dinosaur for children. The Food Building had some coupons to use... though most of the food has become increasingly pricier as time goes on. The Farm was good. Saw baby versions of pigs and turkeys. Saw more variety in the animals. Some of the activities in the booklet seem that there was more to it. In reality, there was barely a section for the activity.",
        "The CNE has gotten worse over the years. I don;t know if the CNE had the ice skating show last year. Or if they had their sand sculpting activity. I don't think I'll be going next year. The CNE is lacking a lot of attraction."

No desinated smoking areas , the smell of pot in bandshell park and limited food VENDORS.  The only highlight was Jan Arden. CNE in dire need a of complete overhaul , can they build a permanent skywheel and how about new food building and a Alpineway 2, less flea market and more tons of fun . Instead of winning stuffed animals how about winning gift cards or food discounts or ride coupons.  Skipping next year's visit as it will the same old,  not worth another bad review"

There is a lot to do there, even shopping and watching Top Dog events, rides, games and lots to see.  Exhibition Place does not just host the Exhibition, it also has the Toronto Home Show, Boat Show, Sportsman Show just to name a few.

The big disappointment for me was the extortionate prices for food. We went to the \"Hitching Ring\" as we thought there might be more choice for our grandson who has multiple food allergies. There was a choice but pickles were $14 and fries $8. A plain burger without the bun was $18 and we were charged for the fries. I asked why and was told that the burger came with chips. However, no chips were present. In addition, I was charged 18% for a party of six even though we were three adults and two children. I asked for that to be refunded. The bill was $117 for one burger, two soups, one pickles and one fries, plus four soft drinks and a glass of water. What a pity."

        "The last time I went to the Royal was when I was in public school in the late 1950s. The buildings are the same old-same old with new facades to hide their age.  (Will they ever be torn down and replaced?) I took the TTC Bathurst streetcar from the Bathurst subway station, but had to transfer to a bus because of work on the Front Street tracks.  But the bus dropped us off just inside the Princess Gate, and I had to walk a fair distance to the entrance to the fair. (It's also a long walk from the TTC loop outside the Dufferin Gate, and even parking lots are a fair walk from the entrance.)  The fair basically consists of a commercial flea market plus the Ricoh Centre (where the Marlies play hockey) and an open ring for animal competitions.  For me, it was all walk-walk-walk until I got bored to tears.   Incidentally, there are NO butter sculptures this year, a big attraction in previous years.  I asked an official where it was, and she was just as surprised as I was when she couldn't find it listed in her reference material.  Go figure."

        "My wife and I went to the Canadian National Exhibition. We went down by bus, subway, and subway much cheaper than $30 parking. We bought tickets on-line so did not have to wait in lines. We took the free tran everywhere. Bring cash as most places there only take cash there are ATM, but the have a pretty substantial service charge for two of us $80 was enough. It will be about $40 per person not including playing games or going on rides. We went to the farm saw alpacas, horses, cows lambs, goats, pigs, and bees. We went to the air show it was incredible though left during the super hornet I recommend ear plugs if you sit close to the air show. Then we went for lunch so many options, but line up for certain foods are not worth waiting in my wife got pulled pork I had garlic snow crab fries which were incredible and the taste out way the wait. We checked out the garden centre and market place where I bought a be cellphone case and saw the Star Trek exhibit then we went to Ricoh Coliseum to see the ice show and trampoliners. After that we saw the super dogs show. Then we walked though the people selling unique foods and had some free samples then back to the food building for dessert. My wife had deep fried cookie dough balls and I had the jolly rancher doughnut from Tim Hortons which is an explosion of flavour. After that we took a picture with a bee and a beaver later with big foot and then we got free samples of beef jerky. Then we got 2 dozen tiny Tom doughnut which I recommended before we headed home. We were out of our house approximately 12 hours and at the exhibition for 10 hours. Now just a word of advice sun screen, hats, and sun glasses are a must. Enjoy it it is a short season.",

This isn't Disneyland so don't expect pristine grounds, gourmet food and high tech to get you around.  Enjoy the fair for what it is - a great place for kids to let loose and possibly even win a huge stuffed animal.  For adults the CNE has tried to make it an enticing spot to visit in the evening with free entertainment in three separate venues and a casino that runs for much of the summer.  A disappointing development has been the slow takeover of the exhibit halls by cut-rate retail outlets many of which are selling pirated goods.  Getting there is easy via streetcar from Union Station and there is discounted admission weekday evenings after 5:00pm."

Great shows also,ice skating,and the dog show fills up fast so get there early, well worth the wait,kids will love it.Plenty of rides for kids also. Lots of variety of foods, just bring cash, most would not except credit cards. Overall I would definitely go back."

        "My family goes to the CNE almost every summer. The school board usually has free tickets for kids and I would enjoy the early bird tickets or any special deal to go as a family - makes it a very affordable day trip for us. There are always many free shows with the exceptional quality of performance as well as hundreds of booths/shops for shoppers. As a day trip, just the shows, food and shops will easily use up our 10 hrs there, so we haven't been doing many rides over the years. I think the parking fee is very expensive (I know it's downtown). Personally, if we dine there for lunch, snack & dinner (since we spend 10 hrs there), plus $35 parking it will not be so affordable. Thankfully we can always bring our own food so we can spare the money for shopping for some unique or little things there. I believe if the parking fee can be lower it'll more accessible for many more families."

        "Nov 11th, the last day of the fair, we took my father, who is in a wheelchair to the fair. He recalled what a good time we had in the past bringing me as a young child and asked if my husband and I could take him there ",
        "After spending $75.00 for entrance fee, we learned you needed to purchase another ticket if you wanted to see the horse show. First disappointment. ",
        "We entered the area where the horse stalls were  only to find empty stalls. Everyone had taken their horses back home I guess except for ones in the show. Second disappointment. ",
        "We went to the small animal area which was not easily accessible for someone in a wheelchair. The gated area where the animals were did not have a ramp at the entrance and in-the area the Flores’s covered in shavings making it extremely difficult to move the wheelchair.   Third disappointment ",
        "Don’t charge a fee to see the animals and then find out they are no longer there because it’s the last day. Don’t charge me twice, once to enter and then again if I want to see a show; its misleading. And accessibility is expected to ensure inclusion. ",
        "Would I return... no chance. It was a big disappointment with a big price tag. "

        "Monday, November 5, 2018, we accompanied our daughter and grandchildren (aged 10 and 9) to the Winter Fair.  I can't say enough about how wonderful the experience was and how well organized the event was.",
        "Our grandchildren LOVED seeing a sheep shearing exhibition, cow milking, learning about chickens and egg laying data, bees and honey varieties.  They watched 3 different horse shows and were amazed by the diversity of horsemanship from the \"simple\" just riding to the jumping.They even got to ride the \"fake\" horses for a real treat.  Feeding the llamas was a highlight for our granddaughter and our grandson was WOWED learning about all the sugar and salt \"hidden\" in foods that aren't good for you.  There were SO many displays and we would have loved to have had more time to see it all.  KUDOS to the organizers!",
        "They were wowed by the GIANT PUMPKINS  and all of us found something special to eat and enjoy at the food court...even though we could have done without the \"beaver tails\". ",
        "This is a MUST GO place for people of all ages and is a bargain in our opinion."

        "Always an amazing time and for a number of years I have made it a point to go yearly to this show of agriculture. I went regularly as a child in the 1980s/1990s and have so many happy memories of the horses (I was always amazed at the sight of the draft horses), the petting zoo, and what was always a favorite of mine, the Superdogs show. ",
        "There have been a number of changes since my childhood visits. The petting zoo was once able to be walked through; while they still have a popular petting zoo you can no longer mingle with the animals in the corral, I can imagine they no longer due this due to liability issues but you can still pet/feed the animals through the fences.  There was once a popular Celebration of Dogs which featured a number of breeds and you were able; this is no longer. There are more vendors, selling various gifts, farm equipment and food to a larger degree than I remember, so to me it seems like it has become more commercial? ",
        "Still, regardless of the changes, a yearly must for me and an experience I recommend for all, regardless of your ages; there is a lot to take in, learn and enjoy at the Royal Agricultural Winter Fair!"

If you are going to spend the day there or at least four hours, the best value for your money is to get a pass that includes admission and rides. We bought the 55 ride tickets and that worked well for us. Some of the rides required six tickets, which I felt was a lot.",
        "Be prepared to be charged an outrageous amount for water and soda. Inside the exhibit hall (Enercare) you can pay $2.00 for a bottle of Nestle water. They have staffers walking around inside the hall only, with coolers selling water.",
        "The usual exhibition rides and some that I haven’t seen before. We were done within 3 hours. CNE is one of those things you gotta do when you are visiting Toronto. It was an average outing! The rain came just as we were winding down."

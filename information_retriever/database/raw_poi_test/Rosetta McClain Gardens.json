  "description": "Situated astride Lake Ontario, Scarborough is a district heavily influenced by immigration. With a number of low-rent shopping and dining options making it a highly affordable part of town, and boasting one of Toronto's largest shopping malls, the otherwise green suburban neighborhood is a good place to go for bargains and discounts. It also draws in photographers. The spires, archways, and cavernous rooms of the BAPS Shri Swaminarayan Mandir Palace are filled with breathtaking art, architecture, and detailed reliefs ‚Äì it‚Äôs like entering a different world, The ruins of columns and installation art at the Guild Inn makes a free-for-all exploration site, while the big-name draw for young photographers is the menagerie at the Toronto Zoo. While many visitors shirk Scarborough as too suburban, its houses are some of Toronto's most mystical and haunting architectural beauties. And for adventure lovers, it has river-rafting and some unique hiking trails.",

        "I have been visiting this GARDEN for over 25 years. It is beautiful, relaxing and nature inspiring.  It‚Äôs the place to come to walk or sit to unwind, relax and appreciate its beauty.  As the signs state that are posted at all entrances: DOGS, PICNICS, BICYCLE RIDING, ANY BALL ACTIVITY, ROLLERBLADES AND SKATEBOARDING ARE NOT ALLOWED (service animals exempt).  Unfortunately people are disrespecting the beauty of the GARDEN and the rules. ",
        "There have been some Cyclists who have raced through the gardens and swore to those who asked them to dismount as per the rules. One of the cyclist was so annoyed to be told the rules that he rode across the manicured grass to prove his point!",
        "A family simply decided that the rules didn‚Äôt apply to them when they arrived with their pizza boxes and foods.",
        "Dog owners who feel justified to walk their dog anywhere they chose despite knowing that there is an off leash secure dog park right around the corner. One bad dog owner threatened to have his dog attack the city worker when he asked him to leave with his dog.",
        "A couple were spotted walking with a large bouquet of lilacs. How dare they steal from the garden. Of course they said that they found them on the ground and didn‚Äôt tear them off the trees.",
        "These are just some real and recent examples to remind folks to enjoy the GARDENS. Please follow the rules to protect the gardens and those who are visiting. If a park is what you are looking for then this is not the place and there are many, many great parks in Toronto to enjoy. However, if you would like to bird watch, enjoy the flowers, plants, enjoy the Bluffs view, feed the squirrels, chipmunks, blue Jays and cardinals then this GARDEN is perfect for you!"

Along with the many plants and flowers several rare trees are also found within the 3 acre gardens with newly paved walking paths covering the entire garden. The gardens also has a very fine rose garden, a large gazebo to rest in and some ruins of the original building that once stood here.  Along with the flowers a great array of animals, squirrels who constantly beg you for peanuts and afford very close encounters with them. early mornings can see deer, foxes, raccoons passing through. Above hawks migrate through the park in the fall. Along with many different species of birds especially hummingbirds. In the spring a large assortment of Warblers pass through making it a birders paradise before the flowers and plants begin to bloom. Fully accessible washrooms, drinking fountain. Since it is a garden no picnics, bike riding, dogs, are allowed in the garden. Great views of Lake Ontario, and on clear days the towers and spray of Niagara Falls are visable"

Butterflies abound and as you walk along the many paths you will notice various types of birds. I have encountered groups of birdwatchers from time to time. ",

If you walk to the most easterly point in the park you will find a very nice rose garden as well as a folly that looks like the ruins of a farm house - great fun and you can safely walk through it.

Obviously it's the flowers and ornamental plants, so carefully selected and artfully displayed. Even the fountain somehow manages to be unique and inviting.

The City has invested in some lovely landscaping and is focusing on planting nectar plants for the dozens of monarchs who use this area as part of their annual southward migration each September. This is a photographer's dream - beautiful blossoms, birds like blue jays and goldfinches daily, birds of prey on the edges of the lake, and monarchs. Picnics are not allowed"

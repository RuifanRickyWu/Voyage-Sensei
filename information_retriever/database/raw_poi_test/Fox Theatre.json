        "On New Year’s Eve, my wife and I, with a dear friend, thoroughly enjoyed watching Bohemian Rhapsody, the current movie about Queen, the fabled rock group, featuring the highly talented and very entertaining Freddie Mercury. As a threatre venue, the Fox on Queen Street, in the Beach area of Toronto, is virtually unparalleled in our city. ",
        "Originally opened in 1914 to show the then new phenomenon of moving pictures in black and white with no sound, this iconiv venue has been refurbished throughout and now features comfortable, reclining seats (not the original hard wooden ones), a much larger & wider screen, and a modern sound system (suited to accomodate today’s high-tech movies). The theatre’s narrow foyer retains much of its original charm with the original, tiny ticket booth at the entrance, movie posters on the walls, a small candy counter along one side, two tiny washrooms (with modern toilets & wash basind) at the far end, just outside the rear of the seating area itself. ",
        "Tickets are moderately-priced at about $10 per person, $8 for Seniors & Thestre Members. Entrance can be paid on-site or on-line in advance, which luckily I had done as there was a huge lineup outside when we arrived at 6:45 for the 7 pm start! As we moved inside, we heard an usher announce: ”Sorry, folks, but the threatre is sold out!",
        "Warching the fascinating bio-pic-style movie was a terrific way to usher out the old year, as the featue on the screen harkened nostalgicly back a by-gone, earlier era of hard-rock extravagancas of the 1970s and 1980s. Many in the audience, like us, were very familiar with the music of Queen and sang along with the full-bore lyrics delivered masterfully and with stylized abandon by the Freddie Mercury character. At several points, but especially near the end of the movie, which recreated the group’s performance at the now, world-famous charity concert at Wembley Stadium in London to raise funds to help the starving people of Bangladesh, the Fox audience clapped and cheered wildly, as if we actually were participating in that historic event in person! We felt a sense of magic in reliving, through film, that once-in-a-lifetime musical event! ",
        "For all three of us, seeing and experiencing this movie at the Fox Threatre will be a New Year’s Eve that we will long remember."

        "Still operating and keeping the name since 1937, the movie house is integral part of Beaches neighbourhood. Founded by Arthur Webster as 'The Pastime'. In the time, when many movie houses in Toronto are closing, they must be doing something right, to keep the doors open. I have been in Fox many times in the 1980's, but not the least 20 years. In the meanwhile they renovated (2007), keeping with nostalgia design, but with comfortable chairs."

        "Had to review this since nobody else has.",
        "Honestly, the Fox Theatre is my favourite cinema in Toronto. It's not without its flaws which I'll start with. Firstly, this ain't a place to catch the newest releases. They catch movies on their second run and the more popular the movie is in big theatres, the longer its going to take to make it to the Fox Theatre. I remember the Avengers almost coming out on DVD before making it to the Fox! They only have 1 screen so it is hard to keep up sometimes!",
        "It's location may be offputting to some of you, it's right at the end of the Beaches on the east side of Toronto. the Streetcar along Queen Street is usually the best way to get there by public transport.",
        "But it is worth the trip, especially for a movie you want to see. For a start, some of the smaller, perhaps more artsy movies regularly make it to the Fox but they don't ignore the blockbusters either. The last movie I saw there was for example The Dark Knight Rises but I've also seen movies like Drive, Moonrise Kingdom, The Raid.",
        "The decor of the place is terrific, it's got an old style cinema decor with a ticket booth outside provided the weather is ok for queuing and the lobby leads into the screen without any doors in the way. It's a warm welcoming building to anyone tired of the same looking multiplexes.",
        "You may think a one screen cinema in an old building may not be the best but the screenings are all in crisp Digital(if shot in Digital), look fantastic and the sound is at a high level and quality. They also provide 3D which I haven't experienced myself there. Seats are comfy and even recline a bit.",
        "It's not a rip off either, a large popcorn(which is yum) and coke is under 10 bucks and a ticket is about 10 bucks too, reasonable in this day and age. They also provide memberships which give you a few bucks off the ticket price and 10% off all snacks and drinks. Worth it if you go a few times, the membership is ten bucks.",
        "All in all, if you are a movie lover and go to the cinema regularly, you will love The Fox."

The world famous Goof chinese restaurant is right across the street.  Then take in a movie with comfy seating. You won't get a headache just going through the lobby. Very old school. line up for ticket. line up for popcorn and drink. Go see a movie. All very quiet and civilized. I have been going to The Fox since the early 80's and love it. Try it once, and I'm pretty sure you will come back. Buy a membership and the price of a movie becomes totally affordable again. "

        "We were encouraged to have a night at the movies whilst staying with family in Toronto. The Fox Theater celebrated it's 100th anniversary this year apparently so we thought we would give it a go. The place is fantastic and reeks of history. Tickets were only CAN$11 each and drinks and snacks were not over priced especially compared to the price of going to the multi plex cinemas back in the UK  where a second mortgage is needed to buy drinks and snacks. Seats are extremely comfortable, a good sized screen and overall very clean. A good value evening's entertainment and definitely recommended"

It has lovely quirks - washrooms accessed from the theatre, so you can hear what you're missing; pipes prone to calamitous creaking and popping, and the old-style school bus room geometry (long and thin). From the rear, we could see well, although I missed a couple of lines of dialogue. ",

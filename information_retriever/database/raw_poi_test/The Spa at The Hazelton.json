        "Malena's massage was the oddest I've ever had. She seemed to press all the wrong spots, like pain spots instead of muscles. And when I asked her to increase the pressure in certain areas, it still wasn't enough. I told her I had hypermobility but she still let my arm hyperextend and pulled my leg way too far to the side so it hurt, and pulled something in my neck when she did the same with my arm. ",
        "I went to open my locker and it would not open, I had to get the staff to open it which took a long time as their machine didn't seem to be working. I went to have a steam while I waited but the area smelled like urine. ",
        "I went to shower and it was all cold. I figured out the warm but only one tap would run warm, the rain shower from ahead would only run cold, and changed the main tap to cold whenever it was turned on.",
        "The shampoo and conditioner didn't clean or hydrate my hair, maybe they replaced L'occitane with some cheap brand, or accidentally used lotion, I don't know. My hair came out still oily and yet also dry and frizzy.",
        "They don't have any herbal or green tea, only black tea. ",
        "No real apologies were made about the locker or the smelly steam room ( which I mentioned) and the lady didn't even ask how everything went, when we were paying at the end.",
        "Pretty dismal and disappointing anniversary experience. We've been to all the spas around town, this was the worst. "

First off we had to walk around the hotel, taking the elevator etc in our robes standing beside people who were checking in to the hotel which was quite awkward and not very relaxing at all. The couples massage took place in a hotel room. The therapists didn't even leave the room for us to change and get on the tables and instead stayed in the room in the \"bathroom area\" which again was quite uncomfortable. Not to mention the massage itself was nothing special. The change rooms were nice and many toiletries were provided but neither of us were impressed. We are spa enthusiasts and go quite often to various spas all over the GTA and this was probably one of our least enjoyable experiences. Definitely not going back!"

My first time at the spa, she showed me around and answered all my questions about the wax that is used. ",

I have sensitive skin, but she uses wax that does not irritate it at all. I love that the spa offers high quality hard wax that makes it less painful. I'm so thankful to have found Gordana as she always does a great job. She  always accommodates me, when I was only able to go to the spa for waxing on a particular day (and I desperately needed it done for vacation) which was her day off, she kindly came in to work that day just for me. That was so kind of her and I'm so grateful as I can tell that she loves her job and really cares about her clients. I am very picky about having my eyebrows done as I want a particular shape, but also want to also keep them looking full. Gordana does the best job on my eyebrows as she did the exact arched shape I wanted, but also kept them looking full. She is the queen of eyebrows! Gordana's kind spirit and positive energy makes it enjoyable for me every time. She is very detailed as she makes sure that she removes all the hair and wax as I never leave feeling sticky. She is the best and I recommend her to everyone! ",

This spa is certainly perfection as I look forward to my spa experience there each time!"

The treatment itself was exceptional and my therapist really made every effort to keep me comfortable and ensure the treatment addressed my needs. The Spa follow-up was excellent and gracious. I already booked my next treatment."

Ray and Sieda were so accommodating and made sure all our needs were met. Ray especially went above and beyond and made me feel so special I couldn’t have asked for a better birthday celebration. I was very relaxed and comfortable from beginning to end. I will definitely return to this beautiful spa in the near future, I highly recommend it!"

        "I've been going to the Hazelton Hotel Spa for many services for a few years. I followed my esthetician Gordana there when the spa she was working in closed for 2 years of renovations. The Hazelton Hotel Spa is the perfect size, not too big- it's very clean, comfortable, quiet and the staff is fabulous, professional and discreet. The hotel itself is a beautiful five star property and many high profile people stay there. A special shout out to my favourite receptionist at the spa- Kimberley. I've been to several other high end spas in Toronto over the years and while they are also beautiful and very good, I found them to be to big and the service is not as personal. "

        "Where do I begin! It has always been my dream to attend Bonnie Gordon College of Confectionary Arts and once the first day of class begun and I was officially a student with my uniform on and cake tools ready to go I never felt happier! I went into this program with self taught knowledge about cake decorating and knew this program would be beneficial for me in furthering my skills. This program did exactly that! The amount of knowledge I learned along with hands on skills has brought my cakes to a whole new level. Everyday we would have practical and written tests which I found very helpful in giving us the maximum learning experience. The staff and teachers were beyond nice and helpful. They truly do make you feel as if you are part of the Bonnie Gordon Family and I loved that! Being enrolled in the 8 week program was probably one of the happiest times I have ever felt being at school. I finally felt I was where I was meant to be. Advice for cake artists who are thinking about doing this program-100% do it! No matter your skill level the teachers do an amazing job guiding you along the way and helping you bring your skill to a more professional level. I am forever greatful for the 8 weeks I spent at Bonnie Gordon! I learnt so much, and met some pretty amazing people! Here are some photos of my cakes that I completed while in the program. ",

        "I found this school on a Groupon site and they had a good deal for a class for two and this was something I always wanted to try with my university aged daughter when she returned home.  She loves to bake and is a bit more patient and talented than I am so her cakes turned out better too.  I found it a bit hard to process the directions and I didn't seem to catch on as much as others, but I was able to produce a decent finished product at the end.  We were given enough time to practice each technique but only about 25 minutes to decorate 6 cupcakes at the end, so I did feel a bit rushed, and we were also sharing some of the icing bags.  I would consider taking other courses at this school.  Their facilities and photos of what some of their graduates have created was impressive.  Worth the money and it was great to spend time with my daughter, who really enjoyed it and is looking forward to trying out her new techniques soon at home!"

Bonnie herself is very involved ensuring a successful experience for all students. The college is very well run from office services, supplies, instruction and overall daily flow. You will certainly get your moneys worth out of any class. I highly recommend for anyone with any kind of interest in cake decor and baking. It is worth a special trip to Toronto. Can't be beat."

        "As a recent graduate of the Bonnie Gordon College of Confectionary Arts, I can tell you first hand that Bonnie and her staff provide you with the professional skill set, knowledge and confidence to excel in the world of culinary arts. It has been such a pleasure to be a part of something so amazing. ",
        "After completing the Confectionary Arts Diploma program, what I can say that sets the Bonnie Gordon College apart from other institutions is the ability from the teachers and staff to make the whole process fun and enjoyable. It's hard work, but everyday I went in and enjoyed it! The curriculum is so extensive, I had the ability to not only learn how to refine my decorating skills to become a cake designer, but also learned to make sweets I never thought I would be able to do before. Some examples of the amazing things I have learned while in the program include (but are not limited to) candy and bonbon making, baking for allergies (i.e.: gluten and nut free baking), ensuring cakes and cupcakes were baked perfectly and moist, macarons, petit fours and rochers, cookies and sugar art. However, aside from this part of the learning, what initially made me decide to attend the Bonnie Gordon College was the fact not only do you learn the baking and decorating aspect, but the business side of things. Bonnie has professionals and specialists in the industry come in to discuss  and answer questions on how to start your own business, what risks and factors to be aware of and what type of business would be best for your own needs. The college follows up with their students to see their level of success post-graduating and even helps to find employment for those interested. ",
        "All in all, my experience at the college was great and I would recommend it to anyone interested in becoming a culinary success!"

When I met the school at the Canada's Baking and Sweets Show in 2012, I found out how one beautiful cake could be made of sugar art. I was amazed! So, I decided to follow my dream to become a Cakes Designer at  Bonnie Gordon College.",
        "The most amazing part was that everything that I dreamed became true. Every day I learned something new and beautiful. I took the full time program and it really was full time. From Monday to Friday every week I finished exhausted of hard working, and that's what I loved the most. The compromise of the school is also to teach you how to succeed in your business and the program is designed to help you on that. But for me is something as simple as that once you enter the school you feel the magic there, and that's what inspires every student that choose to follow this path in the fantastic word of the sugar art."

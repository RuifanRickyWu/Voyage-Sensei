        "We had Hassan as our driver on the Niagara day trip tour. He was knowledgeable and helpful with myself and my mother, as well as the other guests. Individuals pick ups from hotels in the airport area, so didn‚Äôt have to find our own way to a random location for pickup and drop off. Hassan provided great recommendations for activities at Niagara Falls, and then took us sight seeing up along the river to Niagara on the Lake. ",
        "It was a comfortable and safe van, the ride was pleasant and views were immaculate. I am so glad we were recommended to contact Hassan‚Äôs tour by the hotel we were staying at and would recommend to friends and family if they were staying in Toronto."

        "The Service we got this past weekend from this company for my Sons wedding was atrocious!!!!!",
        "First the driver, who could bearly speak English and was so hard to understand  (and is supposed to be there in 15 mins to pick up the Grooms party) calls and says he‚Äôs gonna be 2 hours late!!!  WTF!!!  So my son calls the company directly to say that is totally unacceptable since his ceremony is due to start in an hour. They say they will figure it out. About 20 mins later a driver finally arrives with a ‚ÄúParty Bus‚Äù instead of a Stretch Limo. The party bus is dirty snd looks like it hasn‚Äôt been cleaned from the previous guests. Also one of the steps getting onto it is broken and partially collapsed. Regardless we get on the bus to get to the wedding venue‚Ä¶at this point what choice do we have. He Slams on his brakes a couple blocks from the venue because he is lost  and we all go flying. We finally arrived at the venue and he tries to go under the overhang that everyone is telling him he won‚Äôt fit under. Finally he lets us off the bus and is supposed to go back the way he came to pick up the Bridal party at another address in the same town. As we are waiting for the Bridal Party to arrive 45 mins later we get a call that he has turned the wrong way and is Collingwood instead of Fergus. Omg!!!  ",
        "The ceremony was supposed to start at 2 pm. The Bridal party finally arrived around 2:45 pm. ",
        "Now at this point there is a huge downpour and the bus is leaking onto the Bridal party. ",
        "We make the most of it and get on with the ceremony. Most of us are drowned rats at this point which all could have been avoided if he had arrived st the proper times with the proper vehicle. After the ceremony he is supposed to take the wedding party to the picture location. We don‚Äôt want to use him anymore but what choice do we have. ",
        "Afterwards he finally drops the wedding party off for the Reception. But then he returns about an hour into the reception demanding ‚ÄúFull Payment‚Äù. Causing a huge Ruckus at the entrance area. At this point My son, the groom, looses it on him and tells him to leave the property that he will deal with the boss/owner of the company as he is in no way statisfied with the service and  will Not be paying the Full Price. The driver continues to demand full payment and says he‚Äôs gonna call the cops. We tell him to go ahead snd call them. Again, my son gets on the phone with the owner and they agree to 50 percent in payment. So he gets the cash and hands it too the driver snd tells him to Get the ‚ÄúF‚Äù off the property. The driver still tries to argue and make more of a scene so everyone walks away and goes back inside. He finally leaves. ",
        "This service from start to finish was absolutely DISGUSTING!!!!!! ",

Lots of stops at tourist traps and very little time at the actual tour destination. Do yourselves a favor before you book this and look into bus trips to the Falls for significantly less or any other tour for that matter. No discount for seniors and children which is offered through other tours and your 'VIP discount' on amenities at the Falls is literally $0.30 off the ticket price."

        "The booking process was exceptionally simple and we were confirmed immediately. The day of the tour, Hassan arrived a bit earlier than the scheduled 9:30 pickup; but that was no problem, the front desk contacted us...we came down and there he was smiling and waiting for us. We hopped in the extremely comfortable van and he entertained us with polite humor and good natured jokes for the entire ride. He provided us with water, music if we wanted and made sure the temperature in the van was comfy. We arrived at the Niagara Falls and he gave us a brief drive around with instructions before leaving us for the allocated time at the drop-off and pick-up location. We thoroughly enjoyed our time there and arrived promptly at the pick-up location and there was Hassan smiling. Each time he was exceptionally courteous, helpful and entertaining. He gave us valuable information on each location and the distance between sights. Overall the sights were amazing but the tour was made enjoyable and a day to remember because of Hassan. "

The van was very clean and in very good He also stressed on punctuality which was appreciated. We added the boat ride to the base of the falls.  It it awe inspiring and I would highly recommend.  The visit to the Skylon tower was also very good to give a perspective of the falls from above.  The stop at the maple factory was just ok but a good way to use the bathrooms before heading to the falls.  We had the unfortunate incident going back as the van broke down prior to pickup for our return trip. They sent us another bus after a 2.5 hours wait which by that time was rush hour. Nothing against the tour operator just an unfortunate thing. Thankfully we had no other major reservation for that evening that we could not cancel. I would recommend this tour."

        "Great place to burn off some energy with the kids. I had my son in for week long camp and dropped in a few times for the family skate on the weekends. Well maintained pipes and ramps, and really well stocked shop with rentals if needed. Highly recommended for anyone who is interested in starting up, or dusting off the gear and getting back into shredding!!"

This was my 9 year old son's 1st time skateboarding.  He loved it and that makes me so happy.  Great physical activity.  This is a must if you have kids and you want them to learn something new.  "

        "Such a cool facility with ramps and tricks for boarders and scooters of all levels. ",
        "During our visit there were summer camps going on so it was a bit busy but watching from the viewing area it was amazing to see the level of respect and cooperation of the participants. An unofficial pattern developed and everyone seemed to instinctively know the direction to skate and how to avoid bumping into others. When the odd collision did occur everyone was quick to lend a hand up and ensure that those involved were okay. ",
        "The facility itself is laid out very well and very organized. There is rental equipment available for those who do not have their own and onsite there is a canteen for snacks and drinks. ",
        "The viewing area upstairs offers charging ports for technology and also free WiFi which is a nice option for younger siblings who are waiting or parents wanting to catch up on emails. ðŸ˜‰",
        "An employee named Homer was extremely knowledgeable and helpful and provided lots of information on the facility and also suggestions and ideas on other places to visit and skate parks to try while visiting the area. ",
        "I highly recommend CJs Skate Park. "

        "I was curious to learn what would motivate someone to create, invest so much money ,time and resources in creating what I found out was the 4th largest Not-For-Profit indoor skateboard, Scooter and Inline park in the world.Itâ€™s an amazing place serving all kids in the community including those with special needs.They give so much back which is incredible and rare these days. I learned the founder and main investor Jay Mandarino  has been acknowledged in many editorial articles, letters of praise and with numerous awards including two medals - the Diamond Jubilee Medal from Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II and the Ontario Medal for Good Citizenship from the Lieutenant Governor of Ontario, recognizing individuals who, through exceptional long-term efforts, have made outstanding contributions to their communities. Jay has always had a strong passion for helping others conquer their own human challenges and it is this passion that drives him to give so much back.We are lucky to have people like this who give so much back to our communities.The sk8 park project is one of many things he has done and I and many parents/kids are grateful for that.",

        "My son is 11 years old and was excited to go t Cj's Skateboard park.  We live 4 hours north and I had to attend a business meeting in the area, so I signed my son up for the skateboard day camp.   I called and asked if they would teach the children to skateboard and the sales person said they would and that they would group students according to abilities.  I guess my son was one of the two older children attending the camp and it was more like a daycare service than teaching kids to skateboard.  The students weren't put in groups.  During the three breaks, the children were put in a room to watch the same video, \"Future Nature\" over and over.  They played tag.  The skateboard facility was great other than the air quality (very hot) but disappointed in the day program.  The instructors were not that friendly either."

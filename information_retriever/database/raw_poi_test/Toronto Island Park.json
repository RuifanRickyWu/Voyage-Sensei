Rent a bike at Centre Island Pier—which has fantastic views of Lake Ontario—and explore the park's many trails and paths. You can also have a picnic at Olympic Island while admiring the stunning views of the Toronto skyline. The kids will love the Centreville Amusement Park and petting zoo, too. In the evening, head to Hanlan’s Point Beach to catch one of the best sunsets in Toronto. The park can be explored on a bike tour of Toronto, which often includes other sights along the city's waterfront. – Tripadvisor",

The journey was peaceful and relaxing, with lots of beautiful views along the way. At around $9 per person for a return trip, it’s an affordable and enjoyable way to spend a day outside the city hustle. Highly recommend!”"

Definitely rent a bike in the city and bring it onto the ferry... otherwise you'll have to walk a mile (or several kilometers) to get to the rental shop on one of the islands. Excellent views of the skyline from many locations. A really charming place to spend your time in the city."

While the Island is beautiful and has lots of scenic views, during the off-season there isn't a whole lot to do unless you bring a picnic or a sports ball with you on the ferry. A lot of the restaurants ended up being closed and the island was pretty dead.",

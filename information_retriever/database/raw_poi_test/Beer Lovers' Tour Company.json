His quote was higher than others I received, but this tour was worth every penny and more! We spent a day visiting breweries, Fort York museum, talked beer, history, music and beer. It was a fantastic experience. Oliver combines German order and punctuality with European knowledge of history with truly Canadian love for the country and the city of Toronto. Highly recommended for anyone who wants to see more of Toronto, and who loves beer."

        "My husband and I and my sister and brother in-law were 4 of 10 people who were in the Saturday tour. Perfect size group. Noah our tour guide was great and kept us engaged and was a great host for the day. We started off at Steam Whistle at 11am and kept going until we finished at 6pm. A nice pace of drinking and history. Just wish I had brought an umbrella for the visit at Fort York. Every stop was great. Could of used a bit more time in distillery district but I’m guessing we lost some of our time due to the bad traffic. Would definitely recommend as a fun couple or group day whether you are much of a beer drinker or not. Great value for the price and we all had a great time. "

The recipes,skills and tradition to make these fantastic beers. To tie in the old history of corktown, Fort York and distillary district and beyond is a testiment to his love of beer. Every stop came with a spokes person that shared the love of beer. Great mix. History, beer, good food, and great people made a memorible day. I would reccomand this tour to everyone.

Our guide and host Noah was great as well. Actually learned a lot of the history of beer in Toronto but also some other items in relation to drinking beer and how beer is made. Would definitely recommend this for anyone in Toronto or visiting Toronto. It was great meeting all the others on the tour as well. Very relaxed atmosphere and the food was also spot on!"

We toured the round house , with beers, puns and pretzels and had a blast on the steam-whistle. Then a short walk to Mill-street brewery and onto the Up train to Henderson's . This was off/ on the Bloor street line and a  scenic walk to the brewery. Met by Jeff , and then up to the party room for a beer and cheese tasting . It was Outstanding. Nice guys who made our party of 10 feel welcome and shared a great afternoon. On a sunny day it would have better, there was no pain , or rain in Spain as we sipped our beverage, made from hops and grain - Highly recommended!"

It was truly great to see beer, Toronto and history merging together in such a relaxed manner. It reminded me that in the so-called 'civilized' world throughout history, the Middle Ages, the Renaissance and up to quite recently also in pristine Ontario, beer was a safer drink than water. It was a very pleasant and insightful day. Thank you Oliver!"

The entire day was filled with great beer (never a dry glass), and an exciting look into the history of beer distilleries and how they have shaped Toronto, Ontario and even Canada. Our tour guides (Oliver & Joel) were knowledgeable and passionate, really making the tour and the city come alive. My boyfriend and I thoroughly enjoyed our experience and would recommend this tour to anyone looking for a truly unique day spent enjoying many delicious brews, beautiful sights, and the best sausage rolls the city has to offer (Oliver will be sure to point you in the right direction) !!"

        "I routinely tour breweries in the cities to which I travel, but this tour with guides Oliver and Noah was bar none the best I've experienced!",
        "Oliver and Noah met my group with a full size tour bus and, after loading, provided a narrated tour of the history of Toronto's formation while en route to out first stop, Mill Street Brewery in The Distillery Historic District.  Oliver's wry Canadian appreciation for history made for an entertaining 20+ minute drive over to the District, after which we walked around the Distillery Historic District for a period of time.  Oliver and Noah both gave rich descriptions of the history of the District, including explanations of the various buildings and the preservation efforts undertaken to retain them",
        "We then ventured into Mill Street Brewery, where were enjoyed samples of four different beers, each of which accompanied by an explanation of its type (i.e., lager v. ale), its brewing process, and its flavor profile.  By samples, let me be clear: each table received a pitcher to share among 4-5 people, so no one went home thirsty or lacking for an appreciation of Canadian craft beer.  Pretzel knots with beer mustard also made an appearance, after about an hour of conversation, beer, and beer knowledge, we returned to the bus to our final stop, The Granite Brewery.",
        "Again, along the drive to the next brewery, both Oliver and Noah kept things lively with more history: they pointed out sights along the route, and provided a preview of the next brewery.  Upon arrival we enjoyed a multi-course dinner accompanied by four glasses of different beers matches to the course.  The beer was excellent and varied, the conversation enjoyable, and by the evening's end we all boarded the bus back to our convention site.",
        "Some general notes:",
        "1)  None of the walking, either to the breweries or  around the District, is particularly far or challenging, but the District's streets had uneven stones (cobblestones or similar) throughout, so walking might be a challenge for some people.",
        "2)  The beer selections were pretty well balanced (not all dark, not all light, etc.), but if you saw something you fancied at the brewery that was not part of the tour you had time to order it on the side to sample.",
        "3)  I attended this tour as part of the Rotary International Convention, so instead of a lunch we had a dinner at the conclusion of the tour.  Not sure how common this is, but regardless of the meal, the tour and beer is an excellent time.",
        "Overall, this was one of my favorite parts of my week in Toronto, and Oliver and Noah do a great job entertaining, educating, and hosting you in their city.  I highly recommend taking this tour!"

        "Lengthy review warning:",
        "I surprised the Mrs. with this tour as an Anniversary gift. She wasn’t enthused at first but my rationale was for us to do something different as we both enjoy beer. However, our beer knowledge doesn’t extend beyond Coors Light and Corona so we could both learn more about this concoction. ",
        "Our tour date was October 28th and didn’t quite know what to expect as the day was rainy and a bit cold. We met the group and our guide in front of Steamwhistle Brewery. Our guide Noah (AKA Chris) was there to greet us. Along with my wife and I, there were 7 other people in our group. Noah introduced himself, took us inside and led us upstairs, where he told us about the tour company and Oliver, the owner, a little bit about the beer history and what our schedule will be for the day. BTW, as soon as you arrive upstairs, they provide you with a beer. This is a sign for things to come...",
        "A guide from Steamwhistle, Dan, came to tell us about the company led us to a tour of the facility. This took approximately 40 minutes and once we came back upstairs, Noah had lunch prepared for us. Lunch consisted of charcuterie: pretzel buns, assorted meats and cheeses. ",
        "Then we left Steamwhistle and hopped into a yellow school bus. This was going to be our mode of transportation for the rest of the tour. Our driver Clem (I believe that was his name) was awesome. ",
        "Our next stop was Fort York. Noah took us to a little tour of the museum explaining us the history of Toronto in the 1800’s and its relation with beer. Also visited some of the soldiers and officers barracks. No beer tasting in this stop. ",
        "Afterwards, we went to a driving tour of Corktown and it’s history. This particular section of the tour wasn’t long for us but its dependent of the Downtown traffic. ",
        "Later, we were dropped off at the Distillery District. We went to the Izumi Sake first to taste some Sake. A worker from Izumi, Godfrey, told us about the company and the Sake process making. We got to taste 3 different types of their Sake: Nama-Nama, Teion Sakura and Genshu. ",
        "Our second stop within the Distillery was Mill St. pub. Our guide Noah, played server for us offering us their different beers. We had some pretzel bites as appetizers. The main facility for Mill St. is in Scarborough and therefore out of the way. ",
        "We departed the Distillery for our last stop of the tour: Amsterdam Brewery. Here, as Noah warned us earlier, the beers came fast and hard. There’s no tour of the facility so Noah again served the role of bartender and server for us. We tasted around 7 different kinds of beer, the most memorable for me was Fracture. ",
        "My wife and I took part of the optional dinner meal at Granite Brewery. A 4 course meal with 4 different kind of beers. ",
        "Noah was a great guide. He was knowledgeable, funny and friendly. He made sure to keep our group relaxed and focused at the same time. He was also time conscious which is a must for leading a tour group. He made sure that we were all enjoying the tour plus he was very quick to learn all of our names. ",
        "This tour goes from 11am to 6pm so be warned but the staggers the stops at a perfect pace that you never feel like you are being rushed. This tour is not cheap but it’s worth it. You will be sampling more than enough beer to last a long time. ",
        "Kudos to the Old Toronto Beer Tour and Noah for a wonderful beer tour of Toronto and for making my wife very happy! "

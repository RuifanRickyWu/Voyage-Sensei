There was very little signage around the garden so we kept ending up outside the garden perimeter. We finally used Google Maps to find our way around and back to the main building. Without better signage, we felt the gardens were not interested in making us feel welcome or informed about what was on offer.The plants were mostly annual displays rather than  formal botanical perennials. For the local community it is probably a nice neighborhood green space, but to travel out from the downtown core which takes over 30 min. it wasn't worth the trip."

I really enjoyed not only looking at all the flowers, but at all the statues that were in between the flowers.  The statues were almost just has fun to look at as the flowers.  The gardens themself are not very large so it doesn't take much time to walk around.  Edwards gardens are also right next door to the gardens and it is almost hard to know where one starts and the other ends.  Overall it was a beautiful place to walk around and enjoy the scenery.

It's a spot frequented by photographers and weddings.  I like to call it elegant.  It's great for an afternoon stroll.  For those who want a longer outing (close to an hour), walk down the hill and follow the path alongside the river.  You will enter Wilket Creek Park.  Some of the flowers you pass by have vivid colours. About ten minutes past the park sign, a gravel path appears to your right.  Turn and walk up the many steps to the street.  Follow the road (Salonica) a few metres and then turn right onto Suncrest.  You are beginning a 15 minute walk in the rich  Bridal Path neighbourhood.  Follow Suncrest until you reach The Bridal Path.  Turn right onto The Bridal Path and follow it until you reach the upper reaches of the park.  Turn right into the park, go down the hill and you are back where you started from.  You will have walked by some stunning and elegant mansions.  Pick out your dream home.  You will have completed a circular tour filled with natural beauty and unique architecture."

One nice thing about it is that you can get to most of the good stuff without having to do a lot of walking; a lot of the best flowers, in fact, were planted along the long entry path to the garden gate. (Another is that there is no admission charge.) Perhaps because many of the flowers are close to the entrance on one side of the gate or the other, the place seemed to be popular with elderly people, including a fair number in wheelchairs, when I visited. Beyond this central area there are substantial grounds that seemed to be mostly forest; you can enjoy these if you like to ramble (there are plenty of paths) but skip them without missing much if you don’t. The garden has a pretty-looking café, but I did not sample it."

I was very happy because I have a lot of dietary restrictions due to food intolerances and this cafe has all these delicious goodies available for visitors! They even have a vegetarian burger available with a gluten free bun as well ! for sure  a place to visit :). Parking price is very reasonable $ 2.50/hr. They also have an exhibition room where they provide information about the pieces of art displayed across the garden. Also there’re is a small gift shop inside.

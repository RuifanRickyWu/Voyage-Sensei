        "I had reviewed previous comments and was aware of what to expect.  The check in process was easy - bring photo ID.  We then took the escalator up to the top, where there is shoe locker (unlocked) to correspond with the number on your wrist band.  You then make your way to the change room, where the front desk hands out either short sets or a robe.  For the jacuzzi area (divided), you can wear a bathing suit.  The water was warm and lots of space to sit and hang out with friends.  The steam room was always full.  Massages take place on the upper level and then facility is clean and well organized.  I had a hot rock massage and it was a fun experience.  Back on the main level, we tried the Salt Room, Jade Room, Volcanic Room and Cold Room.  There are beds throughout including Infa Red and there are lounging and areas to play board games.  The restaurant was great.  The food was yummy.  Great selection.  The only negatives - the change room itself is small and not private.  Otherwise, staff and cleanliness were great.  We were there fore over 7 hours and the tie flew.  Would definitely good back.  The parking is also challenging, as the Spa is located in a strip mall with a grocery store beside it.  Super busy.  You cannot bring flip flops - you must puchase from the front desk.  That's it.  Have fun!"

        "This is place is amazing. I went back twice in the past three months. It offers  relaxation, tranquility and comfort. The place is very well maintained, rules are enforced and I love that as it means hygiene and cleanliness are also maintained. It is a very elegant and clean place. The staff work hard to keep the place clean and looking beautiful. There are four saunas and an ice/cold room. The hot tubs are fantastic however are separate in men's and women's change rooms. The food at the restaurant is very good. I had two meals there and was never disappointed. I'd recommend going mid week as it gets busy on weekends. I went with friends and my husband and they all loved it. We can't wait to go back."

Love the Amethyst room where you can just lye down and relax.  All lounge chairs are comfortable, better than my bed.  Jacuzzis have the right temperature.  The whole place is clean.  They have good quality shampoos and cream. The food is out of this world.  Every dish we ordered are amazingly delicious.  Prices are very reasonable.  What I like the most, you don't need to book to go, except if you are having a massage."

The sushi, dumplings and miso soup were delicious. This place is not cheap but if you spend several hours there. My only complaint is that they don’t have enough red light lounges. Please rarely get up to let others use them. We loved the volcanic room and the round sauna rooms. Next time I will bring flip flops for the shower. I’ve heard so much about this place and I’m glad we gave it a try. A very relaxing day at the spa with spouse, or friends."

        "Spend a full day to pamper yourself to rest and relaxation. At check-in, they will provide you with a rubber bracelet with a number which is used to purchase food or items and lock your locker by tapping. There are filtered water stations throughout the spa. They will provide you with shorts and a top. Do not bring plastic water bottle or your own slippers unless they are white. They will give you white socks if you do not have slippers to walk around in certain areas or you can purchase slippers for $3.50 in your change room. I would recommend attending during the weekday when it is not too busy because of wait times to access the therapy rooms.  There are all toiletries in the change room if needed. i.e shampoo, soap, conditioner, toothpaste, mouth wash toothbrush etc... Note: The lockers are very close together so you might find there is not much room to navigate if there is someone else trying to retrieve their personals from their locker. Also the high pressure showers are too close to the Jacuzzi's which splash all over the Jacuzzi's. Some therapy rooms are hot so you can lock your phone and ear pods by tapping the lock box using your rubber bracelet. Overall it was a a good experience."

        "This spa needs to hire a new head of operations, as they are exploiting their customers to maximize general admission profits. We made appointments for 6pm and were told upon arrival that we would be added to a waitlist. After waiting for an hour, we were then told that we wouldn’t be let in until 5pm. Note that their confirmation emails say that they strongly advise to arrive AT LEAST 1 hour for the facilities which are an additional, mandatory cost. They were taking people on a waitlist that was 3-4 hours long. They should not be accepting people on a waitlist if the customers who made appointments can’t even be let in because they have already reached capacity. This is unethical and inconsiderate to everyone’s time. You either operate with an appointment system or a waitlist system - if you apply both, this needs to be done properly."

        "This spa is in the plaza near the Chinese supermarket, you would think what the heck of this spa doing in the middle of the plaza next to a Chinese grocery. But, I was surprised, I shocked actually because for when you go inside is a totally different world than outside, interior & exterior does not match at all. Anyways, “ the GOOD”, the spa is massive, the flooring is heated, the locker rooms are great, the bracelet that they give you in checking in is the key to your locker & for everything else ( food, drinks, massage & facial), you don’t have to pay for when you check in, you pay for when you checked out (believe me the expenses adds up for when you check out), the baths are good, the steam room is good too, the showers are great & the products they used is “ L’Occitane” for shampoo, conditioner & body wash, they used Dyson hairdryer which is actually really good same goes with L’Occitane, I posses one of my own, so I could actually comment on that. They have 6 hot sauna & 1 cold ones, sports bar & gym together in one room, computer & consoles, yoga rooms, UV ray beds, dark rooms, restaurant that serves breakfast, lunch & drinks, the restaurant also serves drinks; fruit juice, pops, bubbas but no alcoholic drinks. Overall it was a great place to chill & hang out with family & friends. I give this place a 4 ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ because the manager & the staff needs to control the noises of the people that checking in here, it’s becoming stagnant & you can’t even find tranquility because of that. So, 4⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️."

        "Participated in a day at the spa with my spouse in December 2021. I booked my massage 1 month in advance of my scheduled date/time and was able to get two females registered massage therapist for our deep tissue 1 hour massage. We arrived early to partake in the various rooms prior to our scheduled 11 am massage. I would say the massage was great however i felt very rushed after the appointment to leave the room ..i guess they required to clean it and prep for the next client. It would be nice to get a buffer at least 5-10 minutes after the massage to get acclimated to the \"real world\" again. All locations were very clean and i felt very relaxed. The food/cafeteria area was also enjoyable. I will say right about 2 pm is when it became very loud. It is always best to either go really early or pay the premium to come in a little later a night for the peace and tranquil experience. I look forward to returning soon!"

They will provide you 1 female and 1 male even you had advised them on the phone and specifically requested it. When you arrived the place that’s the only way you’ll find it. And they will tell you don’t have to or can cancel while you had already driven so far. They don’t really care as they know you don’t have a choice.  They also don’t have a make it right policy in place and don’t think have manager I’ve tried asking for one but they said there is no one.  I’ve been here for 3x giving them chance to make things right but always get disappointed.   Hope this experienced of mine won’t happen to anyone else.

We got there 2 hours before our massages and facials were to start and with a quick dinner felt we ran out of time. So many rooms - for us we visited later on a weekday so most we empty. Loved the massage, probably one of the best I’ve had. Everyone is so friendly and helpful it really feels like you are being pampered from the moment you step it. Because I can spend just by blinking my time there was about $300 which included the admission fee and a one hour RMT massage plus $3 for slippers (I was treated to dinner by my friend). Going back on the weekend and again in December. Looking forward to this being a regular self-care treat."

We tried the different sauna rooms, and liked the variety they offered, including the Ice Room, perfect, for reseting our temperatures after trying some of the hotter rooms. Loved that there was lots of seating available for lounging, and that there are lockable storage units for phones when going into the sauna rooms. Also enjoyed the green juice I got from the restaurant area. Next time, I'd bring a card game to play to take advantage of the tables in the lounge areas."

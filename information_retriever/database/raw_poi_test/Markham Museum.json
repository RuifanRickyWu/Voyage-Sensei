The tour guide (very knowledgable young girl wearing black t-shirt with the museum logo) gave a very interesting tour of all the historical houses exhibited in the museum. Got to hear a lot of historical facts about the various items and artifacts displayed there including the horse carriage, loom etc. She was also very patient and waited for us to catch up during various points in the tour as my baby was also in tow and we had to soothe him at times. It was time well spent and a good family excursion."

Although my guide was pleasant, the tour felt rushed and I would have rather had the chance to explore the buildings at my leisure. The museum runs summer camps and the campers seemed to take priority over ordinary paying customers. The main museum had strikingly little on display: only a bit of farm equipment and pottery."

        "Walking into this modern museum you will be greeted by a horse  dressed in rainbow clothes. The staff was friendly. The price was $6 for adults, free for under 24 months and 13 and under $4. Parking is free. There are 3 floors and you can use the elevator. The third floor has a large play area for kids. You can walk through this place in less than 30 minutes. So I recommend that you do the tour. You will get to go inside some of the houses and stores outside. You won’t see the inside of those places unless you take a tour. There are some buildings like the church that we didn’t get to see cause they are under construction. We got to see 2 cabins, blacksmith, general store, bee house, printers shop. There is also a cute mini golf course with little buildings. It was raining so we didn’t get to try it. You can spend up to an hour or more  here including the tour. This is also a wedding venue. Our tour guide Isabel was very knowledgeable and friendly. For $6 it’s worth the visit. "

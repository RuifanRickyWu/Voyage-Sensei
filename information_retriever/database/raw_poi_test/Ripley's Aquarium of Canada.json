There is a nice automated path under a walk-under tank that moves at a nice slow pace for you to take everything in, but there's not really enough to look at to make that a necessity. After a bit, we just decided to hop off and walk the second half. And that's basically how I felt in the entire aquarium: it's fine but nothing special."

There was even a specific play area for children to play in which was pretty neat. The gift shop was huge and had a lot of beautiful decoration pieces you could buy. The only thing that ruined this experience for me was how overcrowded every single section was. There were times when you couldn't even see the fish because everyone was covering the glass window. It also became very hot and sticky because of how many people there were and this was on a weekday too. "

The shark tunnel was awesome but every other exhibit was mid and underwhelming. It’s also surprisingly short and extremely overpriced for $45+ a person"

If visiting this area I highly would recommend going here. Loved seeing the seahorses and how they curl their tails around stuff when they sleep so they stay in the same spot. The sharks swimming over top of us was an amazing experience. Touching the sting rays was very cool. Reasonable prices for admission.  A wide variety of souvenirs. Will definitely come back to visit again. A new exhibit opening soon called the dragons. It was not open yet, but I would love to go back to see it. So much to see.  Definitely take you time to explore especially if you love water.  We went at night and it wasn’t overly busy. It was very relaxing and a fun enjoyable experience."

The coolest part of the aquarium was the walk through tunnel with the moving sidewalk that took you underneath the sea life. At the end, there is a gift shop which was very overpriced to no surprise. At the exit, you get great views of the CN tower very close up."

We were wedged in, shoulder to shoulder so tightly it was hard to move around.   The aquarium obviously sells way too many tickets given the space they have.

It was so crowded people were pushing, it was hot and sweaty and smelled bad, and it was difficult to see in the various fish tanks. There were no staff in the main walkways and aquariums to talk to. There were literally thousands of people, many with large strollers, blocking the way. It doesn't make sense that they would let so many people in at once. I have no idea what capacity policy they have in place for the Aquarium but the number of people that were all squished in there when we were there should never be allowed in at the same time. It was an uncomfortable, anxiety-inducing, irritating experience. No fun at all. If there had been some sort of emergency, I'm not sure what would have happened. It felt unsafe. We bought \"timed\" tickets online, thinking that the Aquarium would limit the number of people at that particular time. They didn't. We didn't finish our tour of the tanks because it was too crowded. Instead, we headed back to the entrance to complain and get a refund. We were told that the place wasn't even at capacity! That boggles my mind.. my advice - don't bother going unless you go on a weekday out of season, and maybe don't even go then. Really not worth the hassle."

Only reason for 2 stars: 1- for the potential it has if there was at less people. 2- the moving pathway through the aquarium under the sharks/rays is super cool and makes seeing the fish possible and my kids loved it!! Not worth the 180$. Assuming probably better when it’s not peak season.

        "We had pre-booked for a visit to this location. In spite of that we still ended in a too long line-up before finally gaining access. Right from the get-go there were far too many people packed into the location and there was no place it did not thin out. I was there with my wife and grand children, the youngest being only nine years of age and I have to tell you she was afraid of the crazy crowds as well as the many strollers that were being pushed through the exhibit. We were unable to see most of the exhibits and my three grandkids decided they only wanted to get out of the place. Despite that we were only halfway through and had to continue to navigate the crowds, strollers etc. before finally getting to the souvenir store which was also packed with line-ups. There has to be a better way to organize the crowds to make it a better experience or is it just a case of collecting more money. We will no be back."

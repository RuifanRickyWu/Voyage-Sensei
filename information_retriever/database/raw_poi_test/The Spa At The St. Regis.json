      "title": "NYE DISAPPOINTMENT - won't be coming back for a massage",
      "text": [
        "I rather go to my local masseuses or pay more to go to Four Seasons Toronto next time. ",
        "Quite a disappointment for a hotel massage. I haven't been here before. I've been to Four Seasons Toronto and others around the world and also that same week I had 2 massages from my local neighbourhood masseuse so it was very disappointing that I ended the year with this experience.",
        "Staff were all pleasant and friendly! They prompted a call to confirm my appointment the day before and reminded me other facilities that I can use and what their NYE hour are if I were to stay and use it which I appreciate greatly because I forgot all about it. Staff who showed me around tea room, was likeable by the guests she talked to at the tearoom (waiting room). The robe was one of the best one's I've had at a spa.",
        "It's NYE so not all the cups, glasses were cleared since they had a busy day. They ran out of hot water twice when I tried to make tea before and after. Sloane tea is offered. I could have brought better snacks compared to the yoghurt covered pretzels, i don't know if they were dried apricot / other stone fruit, just not what I expected from a hotel. There's a basket of oranges & apples too. Waiting room is open to all, not gender specific. ",
        "The rooms itself for the massage - I heard everyone that walked through the hallway to get to the tearoom so it was annoying as heck! Terrible bed warmer, I asked for a warmer setting, but I was still cold, well they don' t have another setting. Just 1 & 2 so it was crap. My other place had a better warmer with more peace and quite.",
        "Massage was 1 hour. I haven't been here, don't know the masseuse's style. I have knots that were being worked on earlier the week. I know it's there, and how it gets worked on but this one at St Regis, kept pushing it back and forth and not removing or loosening up the knot in my shoulders. I actually had to stop him and asked him to work on my calves instead. Well that didn't go so well when he tried to work on the tight calves and it wasn't comfortable. I can take a lot of pressure and people would asks me during the session too. Nope. It was pretty much having someone just oil my body until I asked him to use more pressure to get something decent out of it.  Sure there. ",
        "Pro - I did like their lemon scented oil. I did like when they use the warm towel to wake your body up. Friendly staff. ",
        "The worst part - no fault of their own. There was a patron in the change room who had an argument with her boyfriend about his mother, she was loud, annoying, she was furious on the phone, and then she cried in the shower. I get she was upset, but nobody wants to be around negative energy on NYE. ",
        "Don't get me started on their Dyson hairdryer. I have one, just not their version that shuts down every so often. I thought it was a lose plug. Another patron was sweet and told me she can move so I can use the other dryer. She also had the same trouble prior. The other patron was still crying so I opted to shake off my hair and pull out my baseball cap and just leave. I live down the street, I rather go home. Front desk did later inform me that it was an auto-shut down system when it gets overheated. Hmmm. have a sign for that maybe? If I just started to use the dryer and I have fine hair but it shuts down on me on the first 5 mins, that's not a good experience even if it's a poor version of dryer. Get a different dryer so other's won't have the same problem since you are aware of this? ",
        "Gratuity was included when the bill rang up at the end. I had to dial it down for the lack spa service for a brand like St Regis in a city like Toronto. I did tip them, it just didn't make sense to be asking for 20% for crappy service. They offered me to speak with the manager which I did for feedback, not to nag them on NYE.",
        "1 was grateful we were NOT in the same elevator leaving as the patron who cried in the washroom thanks to the manager who might have been checking on her and might have tended to her with a small birthday gift. I hope it was sage for her sake."

        "Recently spent a great afternoon at the St. Regis Spa. The massage was excellent.",
        "Access to the pool was awkward (on the floor above the spa), as only the receptionist could allow access via the elevator. Would be more preferable to not rely on the receptionist as it could be delayed if they were with another customer. There is a sauna in the men's changing area of the pool.",
        "Men's changing room (spa) was sufficient. Very small changing area (really only suitable for one person). Couldn't get one of the touch pad controls in one of the showers to work; needlessly complicated. Great steam room."

        "Overall it was a great experience! Normally I go to the four seasons and while this has some perks the four seasons doesn’t have the disappointing pool area is a major downfall"

        "My partner treated him and I to a spa day at the St.Regis in celebration of my birthday. All the staff were  pleasant to deal with and were very much happy to help us with anything we needed. Our massages and facials were great. However, I was very unimpressed with the pool and hot tub area. The pool area had no loungers for people to lay down and relax; instead, all they had were a communal couch and a few arm chairs. The salt water pool was a nice touch - loved it!However, the hot tub was awful. The water was warm, and there was barely any water coming out of the jets. It was like being in a small pool with warm water.  We booked our massage at the hotel rather than with our RMT because we wanted to spend a few hours enjoying the amenities the spa had to offer. Such as, relaxing by the pool and making use of the hot tub. I rated this place a three star because it was my birthday, and the plan was to go and spend a few hours. Instead, we left right after our massage and facial."

        "I was so excited to see the St Regis Spa in Toronto offered a treatment for the eyes called Reflection on a Frozen Lake.  It drains puffiness and helps with dark circles and fine lines.  I booked this appointment for my vacation I wore my face makeup but kept my eyes bare. I was having Tea at a 5 star Hotel after my treatment.  A very nice girl took care of me and proceeded to give me a facial with chest and arm treatment.  My eyes had very little action.  I don’t get facials, I have broken capillaries over my cheeks and by my nose. I’ve been to some of the best spas around and only request body treatments.  I didn’t know what to say, I didn’t want to insult this lovely woman who obviously wasn’t trained in the treatment I was suppose to have.  I left with a bright red face and puffy dark circles under my eyes & less money in my wallet.  The spa on numerous calls swear they did it right.  It just didn’t work on me.  They offered me some eye pads.  Thanks, but no thanks.  What a lesson that turned out to be!"

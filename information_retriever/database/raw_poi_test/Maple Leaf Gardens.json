        "If you are a hockey fan it would be worth a trip to visit a Leaf's game.  I happened to be in Toronto on work when I discovered the Blues were in town to play the Leafs.  It's one of those old time stadiums with very steep stairs.  But great site lines.  It was a Monday night and there was standing room only. They've done a cool thing by making a standing room only section behind the very top row and it was packed.  With a subway attached to the stadium it's amazing how many people you can move out of the area quickly. Fans appeared to be relatively nice to the visiting blues fans.  This was a nice surprised compared to other stadiums such as Chicago, Boston, etc."

My little boy was pretty excited to play hockey in the same building the Leafs once did. Not many little guys from Newfoundland can say they did that. Amazing memories made especially having Wendel Clark and Doug Gilmore come and drop the puck for the Select teams. That was the cherry on the cake. Stories and memories that will last a life time made during our tournament!!"

I was looking at the Ryerson Uni website & found out that you can do a self guided tour of the building!!  I save the PDF to my laptop, but on the day forgot to print it out.  I went to the reception & the guy behind kindly printed it out for me.  I found that the building seemed to have a presence.  Looking at all the photos & clips of history on the walls it felt weird.  I was asked to stop recording the basketball team that was practising in the court. Ooops!! If I had more time I would of taken my time to walk a bit more slowly & take it in!  I will be back I'm sure!!"

It is also the site of the Canada vs America for the gold medal of the Pam Am basketball game. My husband and I decided at the last minute to abandon our comfortable armchairs and got tickets to see this historical event. It was a night of NO REGRETS. $80 each for the best seats in the house, center court, with no obstructions in our sightline. The court is in mint condition which in the winter reverses to a skating and ice hockney arena. The seats are comfortable and in tiered so no problems with beehives hairdos or giant heads. The place was rocking with a dilirious, supersonic hyped and thunderous crowd. There were a sea of red maple leaf, big and small, in the hair, on the entire or part of the body, on the face and in the hand. It was LOUD!!! Who said that Torontonians are indifferent and don't know how to party?!? There were anxious OMG moments as well as a lot of thunderous 'Defence' and 'Cheer' but in the end we were rewarded by our own basketball superwomen with a historical first GOLD! ALL HAIL LADIES, YOU ALL DO US PROUD, WHAT A SWEET CANADIAN MOMENT!!!"

I was able to walk all around the new gym and right into the rink.  It was pretty awesome..

I had no idea what a great job they did preserving the feel of the Gardens.... and you can just walk in off the street and walk right in and reminisce.. ...  I'm so glad I did that...

A high end Loblaws occupies the street level and offers an in-store ACE Bakery and fantastic prepared foods for take-out. There's also a Nutella dessert kiosk making made to order crepes. Upstairs they have a cooking school and an LCBO. Ryerson University leases the remainder of the Gardens ( now called the Mattamy Athletic Centre) and they spared no expense. The second floor houses a huge gymnasium and fitness centre and on the 3rd floor is an NHL sized ice rink under the original domed ceiling of the Gardens. Ryerson made sure to pay homage to the site by keeping some original seats intact and displaying lots of old pictures. If you're in the area stop by and have a look. You will be very happy you did."

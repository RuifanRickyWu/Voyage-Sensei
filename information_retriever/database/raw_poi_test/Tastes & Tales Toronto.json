        "Myself, my brother and niece went on an incredible St Lawrence Market  & Old Town food walking tour with Ian from Taste and Tales Toronto. Why was the food tour incredible?  First and foremost Ian started the tour by giving each of us a bottle of water. This used to be standard practice but since Covid many food tour companies have decide to be ‚Äúfrugal‚Äù and not provide this item! A very small things but it shows attention to detail. Next, the food portions were hearty. No half cupcakes on this food tour! We started with a type of Portuguese chicken dumpling, egg tarts and peameal bacon sandwiches. Next came cheese perogies, Montreal bagel with cream cheese, butter tarts, chocolate dipped strawberries and, then a first for us ‚Ä¶ fresh oysters on the shell. These wonderful foods were intersperse with a two hour walk through old town Toronto historical walking  tour. Ian made the tour so much fun with his knowledge of the area. I have done three Food tours of Toronto in the past year (visiting relatives) and try different companies each time. No more. Taste and Tales Toronto will be my ‚Äúgo to‚Äù from now on."

At the meeting point, Ian shared a warm nibble and got a drink for me for the tour around old Toronto.  During the tour Ian shared his amazing knowledge of the area with me - I learned so much and the whole walk was incredibly entertaining. The food portion of the tour was even better - so many delicious bites of food and being able to get Ian's perspective (as someone in the food industry today) about the market, the vendors, the history, and the food industry made the tour exceed all my expectations.  I also felt that the price was very reasonable.  I highly, highly recommend this tour and this tour company. Ian, thank you for taking the time with me - I had a wonderful experience."

I was the only one in the group and I'm so glad that the tour wasn't cancelled (since I know some companies may cancel if they don't meet a certain threshold). Ian, the host, genuinely cares and is curious about the people on his tour - he was very personable and gave great recommendations for restaurants and pubs around Old Town Toronto! He even offered to take photos! The food is great and very filling - the oysters were my favorite (East Coast vs West Coast)!"

        "I did a wonderful tour of St. Lawrence Market with Ian today. It was a great mix of walking the surrounding neighbourhood and learning about its amazing history -- and eating some delicious food! I've lived in Toronto my whole life and learned a lot from the tour. Ian is a fabulous guide -- incredibly knowledgeable about the food scene in Toronto and with a passion for great food and supporting local businesses. He also took me on a tour of the historic building that houses the market as well -- and I saw really interesting aspects of it that I hadn't experienced before. It was a wonderful afternoon!"

We had an amazing afternoon of great food and drink, some local history and just amazing conversation with our guide who was supremely knowledgeable about the Toronto culinary scene. Highly recommend either for tourists or locals who want to discover some new favorite spots."

Ian and Amanda (and everyone else involved in organizing the evening including the chefs, the owner, the brewer, and Prud‚Äôhomme Master Beer Sommelier salesperson) put together a fantastic menu with great beer pairings. They were two fantastic nights of beer and food and meeting new people. I highly recommend it!"

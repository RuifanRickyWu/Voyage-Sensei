        "- briefing happened inside the room rather than in a separate, making it feel not immersive  ",
        "I do understand its a relatively new room, and one of, if not, the first augmented experience in the Toronto so its still a learning experience, but I think the addition of a briefing area and a much shorter briefing session would be crucial to making this experience more pleasant"

She took the time to explain the backstory of the escape room, which really added to the immersive experience.  We did The Grand Wilshire Hotel.  Once inside, it was immediately clear that a lot of time and effort had been put into the design and puzzles. The room was beautifully decorated with intricate details and the theme was spooky but not too scary to enjoy.  The puzzles were challenging but solvable.  Highly recommend if you're looking for a thrilling and fun adventure with friends, especially if you have never been to an escape room before.  Thanks to the team at The Imaginarium for creating such a fantastic escape room! Will definitely return for more!"

The sets in their rooms are mind-boggling, and you experience all these intricate details right at the front door. I love how just finding their front door is a little game on its own, so give yourself enough time if it's your first time visiting them. Our favourite room was The Steampunk Express, where not only do you get immersed in an adrenaline-pumping mission, but the puzzles and details immerse your mind. The Steampunk Express is a mission you have to try! Thank you, The Imaginarium, for all your effort to ensure we have a fantastic experience."

We did The Steampunk Express as it’s rated the most challenging. There were 6 of us, and there was always something for everyone to do. The problem with most of these places is that they are rated for high numbers and then there will always be people just standing around with nothing to do, this was not the case here which raises the bar. Brent was our Game Master and he was AWESOME! Very informative, quite detailed, encouraging and quite funny. We wanted to stay for another room but they were booked solid, which says a lot about the quality of the rooms and the company. We will absolutely be going back!  Thanks for a fantastic experience!"

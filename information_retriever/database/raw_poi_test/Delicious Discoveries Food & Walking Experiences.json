The stories and facts she shared were up to date and relevant and she has such a great personality for giving tours and sharing information. Everything was wonderful before even discussing the food!",
        "On the food front, it's clear Maya put a lot of thought into the vendors she partnered with. They obviously have a good rapport as each owner/vendor was genuinely happy to discuss their offerings and speak about their business with us. Even better, all the food we tried was delicious! While we did make a lot of stops and tried a bunch of different cuisines the timing was thought out and interspersed with walking so we never got too full.",
        "Truly highly recommend this tour for anyone interested in learning about a different part of Toronto and discovering some new and delicious restaurants! I'll for sure be going back to all the places we visited!"

She's clearly built a relationship with the owners and staff, introduces them to us, and we get to learn about the history of the shop and even some family history. It's a great way to build a personal connection to a space. I mean, all shops are owned by a human or two, but it really makes me want to come back for more after having a chat with an owner, or happy employee!",

She took us to this little coffee shop where we had the most amazing cherry pie. I normally don’t like cherry but it was absolutely delicious. And we had the most incredible falafel I’ve ever eaten. I can’t recommend this tour enough and Maya is so knowledgeable and such a warm and friendly person. Do yourself a favor and take this tour."

I am in my seventies and sometimes it is hard to keep up with the group but this tour was effortless and smooth. Maya arranged for breaks in the wonderful restaurants she discovered so it fits all age groups. The food was delicious, the owners engaged with us with their histories and the portions generous and great quality. Maya also introduced some architectural gems on the way that made the trip interesting and educational. Great tour great guide and great city! Highly recommend!"

She showed us things about the history and culture of a part of this diverse city that I doubt many natives are aware of. The food stops were selected to highlight this diversity. The quality of the food was exceptional, and the portion sizes were perfect for a 3.5 hour walking tour. At three of the five restaurants the owner came out to meet us and treated us to stories about their businesses that complemented Maya's presentation. Maya made sure that each restaurant was notified in advance that one member of our party had dietary restrictions, and in each case a special dish had been made ready for her. But the best part of the experience is Maya herself, a fun person who loves what she is doing, and cares that each person in her group is having a great time."

The food offerings she selected were a perfect way to sample the finest foods in the West St. Claire part of Toronto without having to do trial and error on my own. We tasted fab falafels, great guacamole, awesome Jamaican food and the best apple pie we've ever had!  All book-ended by wonderful bubble gum ice cream and refreshing hibiscus tea and espresso.  Maya makes sure you are having fun and feeling pampered.  In between stuffing your faces she enlightens you on the history of the neighborhood in a way that makes you want to come back on your own and bring friends.  Strongly recommended."

Ever since the \"dog fountain\" was built at this place, I never miss a single opportunity to go and spend at least a half of hour here and it doesn't matter if it's summer or winter. I have been here every day during my current visit to Toronto. It's relaxing to sit here and watch people taking pictures by the fountain, walking their dogs, sitting and talking... Berczy Park is literally an oasis of calm in the middle of the big city.",

        "When I wrote my first review of this place a few years ago, I mentioned that the fountain is made up of statues of dogs looking at a golden bone placed at the top of the fountain. And that there is one cat that doesn't care about the bone and just looks somewhere else. The author of the fountain himself replied to this review and pointed out to me that the cat was looking at a specific place. And yes, he looks at... No no, I won't tell. When you're in Berczy Park, try to find what the cat is looking at. :-)"

Also near C'est What, a beer bar that was highly recommended by our tour guide (didn't make it there yet.). Note:  better in spring/summer, as the water will be turned off in cold weather."

The renovations for it took for. ev. er. But it's a delight, truly. I thought the fountain was the stupidest looking thing I'd ever seen as it was being constructed, but fully functional and filled with water it's just so much more than that - imagine a dog loving childs drawing of a fountain in dog heaven. It's here, on Wellington. Just bloody bananas. It's still a nice place to sit and eat lunch, still alright for a kind of green space. When troupes do Shakespeare in this park, it's usually a 'follow the actors' experience and well worth it. Kudos to the artist for adding the odd disinterested cat sculpture. "

You have to find ‘your’ dog breed and also look for the odd cat too . On the lamppost next to the fountain there are two little birds sat on an arm of the lamp ‘looking’ at the cat on the fountain. There are also other statues within the park and benches to sit on and chill . Lovely spot in a busy city . "

We only had time then to take a quick photo of the cute dog fountain as we were heading to Gooderham Building and somewhere else but I told myself we will come back another time. ",
        "Since it was already Nov, the dog fountain was drained and turned off for the coming winter. It was still fun to look at but an incomplete scene without the water coming out from all the dogs’ mouths. That was a more cheery sight and definitely dog-approved as dog owners do stop by with their pets here. The good thing about visiting Berczy Park on a cold afternoon was that people were not lingering around and we got a good look at the statues. We made sure to find the one cat staring at the two birds perched on a lamp post. Aside from the decorative fountain, there is a green space, a couple of art installation, a few round tables and chairs and lots of park benches. As we were leaving, we found one other cat on top of the reflective cabinet at the corner of Front St E and Scott St."

We arrived on a Saturday at about 1.30pm and it was switched off but signs were up to say it would be back on an hour later. We assume this was because an outdoor theatre group were evacuated performing a Shakespearean play and needed to cut out the noise. When it was switched on it was wonderful. Children sat on the dogs on the outside of the fountain, squirting the water everywhere. It was a lovely hot, sunny day so no one minded getting splashed. Whilst it was switched off a lady with a guide dog in training jumped in to get cool and was fascinated with all the dogs, going up to give them a sniff. Very amusing. Lots of seats and grassy areas to sit down and just watch and chill. Also handy if going to St Lawrence market a few minutes away."

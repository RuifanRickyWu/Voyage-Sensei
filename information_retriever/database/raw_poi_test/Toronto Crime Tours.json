From the Upper Canada Rebellion to the serial killer who struck fear in the LGBT community, we reveal many crimes and tales which shocked-yet also shaped- Toronto.",

        "I recently took part in this tour, and wanted to share my experience with you.  It just so happened that I was the only one taking part in today's tour, but both guides very kindly went ahead with it.",
        "The tour covers a fair amount of ground, literally and figuratively!  Obviously, you will need a comfortable pair of shoes for the walk, but the distance should be ok for most people to handle.",
        "I have to admit, although I have a strong interest in true crime, I hadn't heard of a lot of the cases featured.  For obvious reasons, some of the details can be very upsetting, so please be prepared for this.  Having said that, there are some more light-hearted moments - a fight involving circus clowns, for one!  It was also very interesting to hear how some of these crimes had a beneficial effect on police work and ended up benefitting the community as a result.  ",
        "Both guides had themselves several years' experience in the police, and this gave an extra dimension to some of the stories.  It must be a pretty tough job at times!   I can really recommend this tour - the amount of detail and the cases covered provide a fascinating insight into the dark side of Toronto."

Bob, being retired from a 30~ year police career really kept the tour engaging. We really enjoyed our tour and tried hard to squeeze in another tour before we left, but it looks like it will be added for another trip for us.",

        "I do a lot of walking tours, but Toronto Crime Tours was my first true crime tour and my first tour led by former detectives! We really enjoyed the guides’ personal stories of working in policing. We also really appreciated the tone of the tour - it was fun and sometimes even funny, but did not sensationalize crime or murder. Instead, the guides used each story to explain how it shaped the history of the city, from the 1800s all the way up until the present day. They also addressed some tough topics, like the relationship between crime and mental health care. The downtown tour lasted over two hours and covered a lot of ground - make sure you wear comfortable shoes! - but I would definitely recommend it to everyone, especially if you love walking tours, true crime, or local history. Thanks Bob and Phil for an amazing morning! I can’t wait to do one of your other tours very soon."

The guides are coming with lots of personal experience and not only spoke about the crimes but also their impact on life in Toronto nowadays.  We were also impressed with how tactful they were in discussing topics with full understanding of the sensitive nature of the issues in terms of law enforcement and marginalized communities.  Really really great!"

The two officers present insights that only former detectives could have. And they aren't shy about admitting that in  some cases the police made mistakes, but these mistakes led to positive changes in investigative procedures. The interaction of the tour guides provides an almost theatrical experience. We can't wait to attend their other tours. Thanks for a great experience. Tom and Sharon Scanlan"

        "Bring comfy shoes! The walking tour takes approx. 10,000 steps with 1 bathroom break. Phil & Bob along with their witty story telling and respect to the sensitivity of the crimes told, I felt this tour captured a wide variety in types of crimes played out in Toronto. The tour started in front of the Roots store outside of the Eaton's Center (250 Yonge St), and ended in Courthouse Square Park (10 Court St). It would have been nice to end the tour where we started - especially if you're not Toronto savvy, and also if you're in a rush to add more $$ to your meter. I recommend booking this tour on a Sunday - less traffic in the city, cheaper parking! All in all, a great day full of facts. If you're a true crime junkie, you will still get the great experience because you can visually see where some of these crimes were handled. Definitely will be returning for the short 1hr tour from the Distillery District to the Flat Iron Building."

We took the downtown tour and we’ll be taking the west end tour next. It was worth every penny."

Also a great way to make friends! Would highly recommend to anyone, and once they open more tours up I’ll be booking right away."

The tour was very enjoyable, informative, our group moved well from one point of interest to the next considering the size of our group. Bob and Phil were personable, knowledgeable and mixed humour with the darker side of Toronto crime and it was a great way to see the inner core of Downtown Toronto. We knew some of the stories and learned so much more. I would highly recommend the tour and our little group are looking forward to more of the crime tours with Officers (retired) Bob and Phil. Keep up the good work fellas!"

We live in Toronto and are familiar with some of the cases presented but had no idea the impact the crimes had on current day policing or policies. Both Bob and Phil are great storytellers, engaging and informative. We would certainly recommend this tour for visitors to Toronto or native Torontonians who wish to learn more about our city’s history. We will definitely be signing up for the east end tour, we really enjoyed Bob and Phil’s stories, history telling and company, great job!"

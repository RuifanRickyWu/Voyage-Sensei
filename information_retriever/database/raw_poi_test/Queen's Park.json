If I were in charge I'd renew some bench seating and add some more picnic benches. I didn't spot a fountain, that would be nice. The building has tours still, I took one as a school kid. check before your visit if the streets are closed for festivals which, post Covid, are starting to return. Parking is nearby, there's more to see nearby (ROM, Art Gallery). Come by transit, it's easy and cheap."

        "As anyone from Toronto knows, \"Queen's Park\" is both a \"park\" and the informal name for the Ontario legislature, which is located on the south end.  This park is surrounded by major roads as University Ave runs both south and north of it (turning into Avenue Road) and is circled by Queen's Park Crescent East (road going north one-way) and Queen's Park Crescent West (going south one-way).  The northern portion of this middling size urban park has an extensive tree canopy formed by a large selection of different non-native trees and is criss-crossed by paths that U of T students use to get to and from classes and dorms.  The Wikipedia entry will give you a history of the site and a run-down of all the statues.  I particularly like the statue of the poet Al Purdy - he sits delightfully slouched-in marked contrast to rigid posture of Queen Victoria, George Brown and Sir John A. MacDonald.   It is a short distance south from Bloor Street, the Royal Ontario Museum and surrounded by the U of T.  The legislative building is a rather impressive neo-Gothic pile, the front of which has seen many demonstrations (including a few that I have been too;)  The view from the front steps down University Avenue is quite impressive.  I am sure it makes the Members of the Legislature feel very important."

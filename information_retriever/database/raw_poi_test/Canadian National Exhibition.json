  "description": "A showground, fairground, carnival, concerts, horse show, farmyard, garden show, food hall, restaurants, and a fabulous Mardi Gras parade are all rolled into one for the Canadian National Exhibition, held in Toronto each year. For 18 amazing days leading up to and including Labor Day on the first Monday in September, about 1.5 million visitors flock to Canada’s largest fair, The Ex, in Exhibition Place by the shores of Lake Ontario. It's a far cry from its beginnings in 1879 to promote farming, industry, and arts as today the fair acts as a showcase for the nation. It is a fabulous annual tradition to head to the city for amazing, old-fashioned fun for all the family and, for many, it is seen as a celebration of the end of summer.",

        "If you grew up at the CNE, you will also admit this was the worst year ever.  Prices for games even kids games are ridiculous.  Cost more to play games compared to prizes offered.  $10 minimum to play any game or $20 for a better prize.  You are basically paying for the prize, but half the toys are Dollarama level.  Games once upon a time were $2, $3, $5, or $10 maximum.  Air show was not as spectacular as prior years.  minimal tricks, more fly by. No extraordinary food at the food building to really talk about.  If prices stay the same or go up next year, I don't recommend the CNE and would probably recommend spending your money at Wonderland or Centerville depending on your age."

        "I went to TheEx for the experience but I just can’t say it as fun as I thought. My wife and I took my granddaughter and went straight to the kid’s amusement park. It is really far from the parking area so be prepared to walk or wait for the little tram that moves people around. Kid’s world is ok I guess but nothing to write home about. Then we went to the farm which was the highlight for me. My granddaughter also enjoyed all the activities. If you have small children it is a must go building. If you don’t have a lot of money, stay at the farm as much as you can, everything there is free. We went for food and there were plenty of options. Not too expensive but more than what you pay normally for fast food. The Art’s and crafts was our next destination. Some intriguing stands and interesting things all around but it was the same you would find at a flea market. We stopped to watch a couple of events and then took the tram back to the parking building.",

Everyone who works here are engaging. Theres a section in the back for smaller children. They have multiple of what seem like small airline hangers filled with different things going on. One has variety of food stations. Another has stations selling things like crafty jeeries etc. another has different flower gardens. Its just an amazing vibe! I will be attending next yr again. OH! AND IF YOU ATTEND AFTER 5pm Monday thru Thursday you can buy admission tickets for $13. Reg price is like $26"

        "I’ve been coming to the CNE my whole life. The best times were when Ontario Place was still open. We still have a good time when we go but I feel like Wonderland, it has lost a lot of the magic. Biggest negative is the cost of everything including $50 just to park your car. Tons of amazing food options as always even though the majority of them are super expensive, there is no shortage of amazing food here. In the food building I tried one of the Gangnam Style Dogs and it was so delicious, gimmicks aside. My fiancé got a lobster Mac and cheese from Eat My Bowls and it was also very tasty. Tons of hits and also some misses here. You’ll have fun, but you’ll definitely leave with lighter pockets. SO EXPENSIVE."

It was a bit of trek from our hotel, though easy enough to get to via public transport (in our case we used the trams). As we went on a Monday our son got in for a reduced U13 rate, so it was relatively inexpensive. In terms of things to do it was pretty good, with a mixture of fairground rides, food stalls, trade exhibitions, a photography exhibition, bars, music stages and when we visited, the Canadian armed forces were there along with vehicles and equipment that kids and others could look at and handle. There was also a pricey Pink Floyd exhibition, which given the cost and our lack of interest we didn't bother with. All in all an interesting day out and there was plenty to keep us occupied for the entire day. "

The buildings like the Colosseum  is like going to a flea market with cheap junk and people crammed beside you. There are not enough benches to sit so its even worse. The free train is okay but it only goes around the back of the buildings so its not like you get to see anything while on the train. Food building - runs out of food, expensive, with no place to sit, and the washroom lineups everywhere are loooong so you better plan the washroom a half hour in advance. I remember when it was a great place to go, sadly I will not be going back."

The biggest problem from the previous visits - parking.  This year, took the subway and street car, got there from Queens station with 35 minutes.  Nice ride, highly recommended. The subway takes you to Union Street and there is a street car that takes you to the CNE.  Buy round trip tickets, it's impossible to buy the tickets on the way back.  There was no line to purchase tickets to enter.  We went in and went directly to the Food Pavilion, lots of choices, CASH only for a lot of the vendors.  Grab the first seats available, they are very limited.  After lunch we visited the Art and Craft, midway and the shopping Pavilion.  We also visited the Lantern display, the interactive stuff was kind of lame but fun for the kids.  Lots to see, do and eat.  Although, have to admit, not as good as it was thirty years ago, but still will come back."

The website DID NOT mention anywhere that it was only until 2 pm and I tried to email and never got a response when I wanted to ask before traveling. So we missed the wheels and prizes. (We like that). The rides were fun but some lines got very long. The skyway line was UNBELIEVABLE toward the end of the night. I know people take it to get more toward the front of the midway but the line was halfway of the walk there so to us, it was worthless to stand around to wait when you are halfway there. Food truck selection was awesome, food product building was awesome. I wish the \"arts and crafts and hobbies\" was labeled a flea market b/c that is what it was. Vendors selling their crafts. I thought it would be a fun area for kids... arts n crafts. We missed some of the shows and inside exhibits but the kids had fun. Some games are priced well some are stupid expensive."

Did get there early and was able to enjoy the experience before the crowds got larger and was glad that i did. Did notice that the cost of even roasted corn was a bit much but did love the mini donuts and pub type foods and drinks, sorry I missed the dog show but hope to catch it next year."

        "First time going to the Exhibition in 3 years since the pandemic. Parking was $40 and adult admission was $25 adults and $20 for seniors. They have lots of rides, carnival games for prizes. There’s a casino and casino patio. Also the traditional air show. We did the Superdogs Pawvengers show. There are so many shows and events going on everyday. Lots of outdoor food trucks and a food building with lots of choices. There is so much to do here that you can spend the whole day. This is an event that becomes a family tradition every year and the CNE is a Canadian tradition in Toronto and it’s been around 137 years."

        "Don’t go, especially on a weekend like we did last weekend, because the crowding is totally crazy and the price of everything is totally outrageous!! You’ll line up for at least an hour for the same food you could have bought at home for much cheaper. Be prepared for $4 water and $8 for a cob of corn, and that’s the cheap stuff. The Food building is totally overcrowded with long line ups. Forget about finding a place to sit. anywhere. We went specifically to see Jersey Nights which was on at the midway stage but we didn’t even get to see the whole show because they told us to leave because we weren’t buying their overpriced drinks. This isn’t mentioned on the CNE list of events online. My husband has a serious spinal cord injury and can’t stand long. From what we could see you won’t even get near the rides. I’d advise that you save  your money and go elsewhere. We wish we had."

Given the food, fairground rides and the like it could turn into an expensive day but this isn't something we would be visiting every day.",
        "We had a funnel cake, saw the animals, our son played some fairground games and rode on some rides, pottered around the market stalls and filled ourselves up on some really tasty poutine. If I was back in Toronto when this was on, I'd go again."

Based on how its set up, I was hoping that there would be no lag time in real life, but having to be three 15 minutes before (like they ask) and then wait an extra 1/2 hour on top of that, did not make well with patience. For establishments like this, and time based games, this shouldn't have happened. 45 minutes is unacceptable.",

When you walk in, it doesn't look like much, but as you are led to the room (blindfolded) you feel like you are really in the situation described to you. We went with a group of 5 people, 5 teenagers, and booked the Contaminated Hospital room. This was the easiest room, recommended for beginners. In the room, there are a combination of old-fashioned locks and technology, which is a new twist on the traditional keys and codes. We were not able escape, unfortunately, but we had a lot of fun trying. ",

Also you’re given a free beverage your belongings are kept safe in a locker. 10/10 recommend with their amazing employees!

The only reason this place has such a low success rate (4% allegedly) is because the advancements are so stupid, you would never think of them. From step to step, the connections are so far out, you will leave feeling baffled. It was unfortunate to go through this room not experiencing a single logic based puzzle. Don't feel like an idiot for failing rooms at this place, be glad that you weren't stupid enough to conenct one minor detail to another. Save your money and go to a different escape room which is likely cheaper with higher quality puzzles considering this room costs $25 AFTER you like their facebook page and sign up for a membership. The only reason I gave this room 2/5 was because the staff was friendly. Despite this, I do think an escape room should almost entirely be rated based on the quality of their rooms."

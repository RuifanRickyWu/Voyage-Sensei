  "description": "I am an award-winning retired History teacher who also taught French, Spanish and German. I love telling people about events from the past which affect us today. I have led several historical bike tours for members of Toronto Bike Meetup in the past 3 years, and got super positive feedback for them. That inspired me to lead unique and unconventional bicycle tours to the more interesting and lesser known historical sites in the city. I call it History in Motion.",

        "Wow, this tour was fantastic! Sean was friendly, knowledgeable, funny, and clearly passionate about the city and its history. You can really see his history teacher skills at work on this tour as he makes history come alive in creative and unexpected ways. The route is carefully chosen with lots of interesting stops. Plus the whole ride is on a safe set of trails that are pleasurable and easy to explore. Overall, we had a wonderful time and I can strongly recommend to tourists and locals alike. Enjoy!!"

        "My husband, son and I went on the Toronto bike tour with History in Motion in the spring. We absolutely loved it (despite the poor weather). Sean was super enthusiastic and very knowledgeable about so much Toronto history. I used to live in Toronto and learned SO much about the city that I never knew before. The stories he told, like the one about Ned Hanlan, were really engaging. Sean was really well organized and always attentive to how everyone in the group was doing, including my son who had a flat tire :( Overall, a terrific experience and we would highly recommend History in Motion for anyone visiting Toronto."

Most of our ride was along the waterfront which was really pleasant. Nice, relaxed pace. A lot of fun, I definitely recommend it, and would go again."

It was very interesting and I learned a few new facts about Toronto and feel like I know Toronto much better now. Sean was a great host because he made me feel comfortable on the tour: he is friendly and open. It's clear that he takes pride in the city, especially its history along the waterfront. It was a very unique tour, one that included healthy snacks."

I live near where we biked and still learned a lot about my area, making me appreciate living by the waterfront even more. I'd love to do this tour again as there was so much information I couldn't retain it all. Overall, a fun, enjoyable learning experience with surprises to boot! Sean, thank you for being so adaptable to the weather and my technical difficulties. :)"

We visited parts of TO we had never seen before and Sean knows every detail of this great city. Sean can match the biking experience to the physical level of the participants.  It was one of the highlights of our trip to Toronto and we will book another trip with him the next time we are in town. We give Sean our highest recommendation!!"

We were traveling with our 13 year old son, and Sean's background as a history teacher really helped in his detailed descriptions of Toronto's rich history. This was our first activity on our trip, and we are really glad we chose this tour. Without a doubt, I'd recommend this to anyone headed to Toronto. Sean is from there and lives there, which is evident from his level of passion in sharing his beautiful city!"

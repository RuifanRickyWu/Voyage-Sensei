The \"performers\" were lack-luster, and the tricks were amateur level at best. I was tempted to commend the hostess who escorted us, for being able to act so enthusiastic, as without her clapping and woot-woot after each performance, you could only hear crickets.  I've been fortunate to have seen Copperfield, Penn and Teller, Chris Angel and Siegfried and Roy live, and wasn't expecting that caliber of magic, but I also didn't expect it to be on the level of what you would see at a children's birthday party. As others have said, they did a good job in making my $100 disappear, but that's about it."

I've seen better acts on the subway, and despite extensive use of tv screens, actual TV at home has better shows.  I feel sorry for the employees and magicians here that have to take this seriously when they're probably well aware that it's a cash grab that will never be recommended or praised. Awkward as heck for a date, just cringy.  Not a slice of Vegas. Hope these kinds of exhibits stay out of Toronto.  "

Two of our group fancied themselves as ‘magicians’ so were very excited at this bonus, and what a bonus it was! We were privileged to get to see The Secret Chamber, and none of us could believe we could see something so thrilling that close up. That was worth the price of admission right there. Our guide was great and super knowledgeable, embarrassed to say I cannot remember his name, only he was from Scotland or Ireland! Loved the trick we all got to do with Penn and Teller. The whole experience for us was about 90 mins with a visit to the shop. Can’t wait to do the iPhone tricks with my children. We didn’t have any children in our group, but I know if we had, they’d have given the whole experience 5 stars too. Brilliant. Sublime. Astonishing! Thank you. We’ll be back with family and friends."

The few magic tricks were very old and basic, nothing new or exciting. They focused more on room decorations and fancy screens than on showing magic and illusions. The whole thing was about one hour (including transition time from room to room). It was definitely not worth the overpriced ticket and $40 parking. Not recommended."

        "Jamie Allen's Illusionarium is a fantastic immersive experience that is also great for families and kids. On arriving, you climb the staircase up to the coat check area where you are surrounded by amazing artwork on the walls and floating top hats. It immediately sets the scene for what is to come. All of the magicians were superb and I have never seen anything like this, not even in Las Vegas. One of my favorite rooms was the Secret Chamber with the water escape which I have to admit was very intense and certainly keeps your heart pounding throughout. The Penn & Teller illusion was fantastic and it truly felt like the magic was happening right in my hands. The Evo-lusion Theatre with its LED Screens will satisfy those that love their modern technology and is a wonderful finale to 90 mins of magic that simply passed too quickly. They have gone to great lengths to make everyone feel safe during these Covid times and the guides who escorted us through the experience were simply outstanding. From floating hats, water escapes, holograms of Houdini and more, I promise you will have never experienced anything like Illusionarium. It is definitely not to be missed!"

The one live magician was not good, the youngest kid could spoil all his tricks.  The diver they lock in the tank was good but their clock runs fast…The last “grand finale” trick failed, completely, and they sent everyone into the hallway.  A guy waiting to do the VIP tour was there and was kind enough to do card tricks to entertain us.  It was probably the best thing we saw and it wasn’t part of the tour. They then exited us out the gift shop without an explanation or offering to redo the trick, but gave us a free COVID face mask for not getting the big trick.   This was unbelievably disappointing for adults and kids/teens alike.  It is way too much money for what you got."

There was a lot of talk and museum like artifacts and info. Limited on the real live magic except at the end for 2 impressive tricks. I liked the pod organization that allows for good social distancing while still feeling interactive. Not sure I can recommend it too highly but filled a good hour we had free in the afternoon."

The host has great energy but is often ahead of the group and can’t be heard. That energy is extremely annoying as they gasp dramatically and are the first and loudest to clap at every... umm... “trick?” It doesn’t feel like there are any magicians involved, the location and actors are lacklustre and underwhelming. The biggest illusion was where our money went."

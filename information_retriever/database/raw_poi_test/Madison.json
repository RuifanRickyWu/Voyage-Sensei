        "I’ve been to the Madison tons of times before but there is a huge difference between what it was like 10 years ago and what it is like today and that difference is the TERRIBLE staff.",
        "I am glad there are many bad reviews of the staff all over the internet because I thought maybe they just, for some reason, were hating on me!",
        "The staff were already absolutely rude from the begining. I’m a very cheerful and smiling person and when I tried smiling at them and sympathising with them, all I got back was a grouch, (from the security staff outside and the girl at the front door, to the downstairs bartender Brandon Mark) that’s when I knew to keep the communication to a minimum.",
        "I’ve only gotten two beers from here on this night on the top floor. The first time, my friend got it for me, and the second time I got it but used his credit card. I didn’t want to assume he wanted to tip, so I left it at 0$. Not that I would need an excuse not to tip since it is optional but since I have probably given this place dufflebags of money over the past 10 years and the bartender was already very rude for no reason, I did not go out of my way to tip her.",
        "I believe her name was either Jess or Maddy. And when she had the gall to actually confront me negatively for not tipping her I was frozen and stunned. My friends who know what I do for a living thought that I might get angry but I assured them I was not angry and just wanted to tell her how appalled I feel.",
        "I was very sad and felt tears coming to my eyes. I leaned close to her and tried to get her to sympathise with me. I told her that I am a delivery courier, and that I work everyday in the cold outside in Forest Hill. I said more than ",
        "60% of my clients who own giant mansions and tons of cars simply don’t tip me a dime but I have never felt angry at them the way she feels towards me. And before I could finish my sentence, she looked at the security guard and snapped her fingers to get me kicked out.",
        "I did not hesitate for a second and left crying because I can’t handle confrontation. The security staff that was rude beforehand suddenly became quite kind and understanding when I told them what happened and they all nodded in a way that said “oh yeah she does that sometimes”.",
        "I was outside in the cold without my jacket, purse, or cell phone until my friends found out what happened and came out, they were stunned that a person like me could be kicked out of somewhere. My friend told me that the bartender told him I yelled at her in a rude way so she had to kick me out and he could not believe it since I can’t ever handle any confrontation.",
        "If the manager reads this review, he may not care that bartender ended up ruining my whole group’s night and helped him lose a whole lot of regulars (at least 10 people), but I still believe that the Madison will one day get a wake up call and fire the toxic, entitled, terrible staff.",
        "In the mean time, I suggest everyone stays far away from this stuck up place.",

        "We have been to the Madison many times before, and never have I reviewed it, until now.   I guess I have always been attracted to the summertime deck-party atmosphere, while the beer is the attraction, it has always been the food that disappoints.  None more so than this last and final visit. This weekday eve saw the seating area less than half full, but service was surprisingly inattentive and tardy.  While the beer on tap is readily reliable, our food was inexcusably poor.  The iceberg lettuce salad had clearly been cut with a knife the day before (as there was significant browning on the edges) accompanied by a sub-average previously frozen commercial patty burger - but it was the undercooked chicken wings that were wholly unacceptable - and although we agreed to have them re-served - they then exhibited that distinctive “deep-fry burn” - and while the meat was now cooked, the skin was inedible.   And it still cost me $60 and 2 hours and 10 minutes of my lifetime.  That’s a huge fail."

My friend started filming them because of how dangerous they were being, and one of the staff grabbed her phone out of her hand and took it away.  It took us 30 min to get the phone back, and when we did it was discovered that they had gone into her phone and deleted the videos of him harassing us.",

We met so many friendly people that night, people would just come sit down and chat which was pretty cool. The atmosphere was a fun one, can see why its so packed!"

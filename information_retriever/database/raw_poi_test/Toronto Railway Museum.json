        "Have been here more than once. Is lovely when it is quiet and not full of rambunctious children as one can really take one's time but comes alive in summer. It's in one of the sheds, 17, in the roundhouse -  walk into a perfume of soot and oil and grease and metal and engine dust. Films of the golden age with Gordon Lightfoot's railway trilogy playing in the background, plaques, dishes, timetables, model railways, a squirrel running around, restoration going on on an engine they use to move the outside cars/rolling stock (engine #10). The Nova Scotia wooden passenger car named Sans Pareil (\"without equal\") parlour and dining car from 1896 of the DAR became the business car after major extension, for the DAR VP (private apartments, meeting room and office). It survived the 1917 Halifax explosion that caused the roof of the station to collapse on the car and the VP and his whole family were in it and survived... brass railings, horsehair insulation, viewing platforms. Inside focuses on the the Canadian National, Canadian Pacific and the Dominion Atlantic. Managed once to play with the train simulator, which I could have kept up for hours. Outside there are engines ad cars that, during the summer, can be clambered upon by child and adult alike. Engine 4803. Canadian Pacific Cape Race. Toronto Hamilton Buffalo Caboose. Huts and stations and track changing booths. There is a gift shop and a mini Go Train that runs around the park on a single track. Oh the days of yore!"

We are very interested in the history of railroads, and had visited many railroad museums while travelling through Siberia the previous year. There were 11 items on display in the area outside the museum, which was the main hub of the railway transport system at Union Station. It was initially the hub for steam trains, and was probably at its' peak of activity in the 1940's. As  steam trains made way for more modern diesel engines, the station gradually lost it's importance. It used to cover a huge area of downtown Toronto, but this Heritage Center and Museum are all that now remains.",
        "It is free to walk amongst the external displays, and all have signboards to explain their historical significance. The displays included the coaling tower, roundhouse, turntable, watchman's shanty, Cabin D, Don Station and Water Tower. There were quite a few trains in addition to the layout of the buildings. Train types included U-2g steam locomotive, wooden tank car, Alco S-2 (the first diesel electric locomotive in Toronto), 1929 model of a first class carriage and a 1931 sleeper carriage. We thought that the displays were well presented, and regret missing the museum.",

I can imagine i'm not the only one who's missed their step while walking around.  ",

The roundhouse building itself is now mixed use (housing the rec room and steamwhilstle brewing), but it seemed the museum preserved the original feel of the round house.  There was an interactive simulation exhibit where you could learn to engineer a train, and lots of old signs and artifacts (like from the queens visit).

I requested a refund and only after enduring arguments that I should pay because I had already seen the whole museum, even though it was tiny and contained nothing much of consequence. This was obviously a ploy to extract $10 from unknowing tourists to pay for seeing the trains on display on the outside the museum.

The 10 dollar per person entry fee which had seemed OK beforehand suddenly became a king's ransom. There was a quarter of a large hanger given over to some very lacklustre exhibits - many of which weren't working. There were two carriages to explore but there was really nothing of interest and aside the train simulator (which I think was intended for children but we were scraping the barrel by this point), there was nothing to illuminate what must have been such an important part of the City's history. We challenged the fee but the woman on the desk has probably heard it a thousand times before and was adept at some corporate spiel to try and justify it. We stayed 20 minutes max and that was with making every effort to try and see beyond the dully displayed information. 40 dollars for 20 minutes.

        "We walked over to Roundhouse Park to grab a snack before a Blue Jays game (we were in town for the day for the game), and it was awesome.  It's an old train roundhouse with train cars everywhere.  Most of the garage areas have been converted into restaurants or breweries.  It's an awesome place to let your kids play, grab a bite or a brew and just chill."

  "description": "Our tours bring people together. Join us as we travel hundreds of kilometres to experience the city – up close and on the streets – through parks, to well-known landmarks, and in the many neighbourhoods that make up Toronto. The Tours program is curated by Heritage Toronto, but driven by over 100 volunteers, 25 community partners, and an annual cohort of Emerging Historians. Together, we have reshaped and shared the stories of Toronto and connected communities across both time and place. The 2019 Tours season has ended. Join us for our upcoming 2020 tour season running from May- October. Did you know? The program started in 1994 with 18 tours – the first featuring downtown architecture.",

        "We had a tour in a really hot and sunny summer afternoon, and the tourists are tired. We start off at st. Lawerence market and we had go around the district with some stops at front street, st. James church, st. James park, Adelaide court, King’s hotel. The speech is very informative about the history on the British and French colony, and the tribe. At few stops are about jail stuff and execution. The guide was very enthusiastic and passionate that we could really feel her love in Toronto. The guide is very flexible and caring too, she first tends too end at the st. Lawerence but as she saw us we are very thirsty so she drop us off at st. Lawerence to let us have some drink. Overall, it is a very pleasant and enjoyable journey"

        "I attended many Walking tours with Heritage Toronto and they are for sure different than other companies that do Walking tours because they take you to places that are all new and no other tours offer these same places. They also shows many photos from old heritage that shows you the places in the old days versus what you are seeing currently, they even provide photos of people from old age that they talk about. Their tour is very interactive and they are very friendly and try to involve everyone. The tour is only for $10 donation but they are doing a job that worth much more than that so it's a pretty good deal. Only suggestion for area of improvement is for the tour guide not to read all the time from papers (I understand it's lot of information to give) but to try to add their own input as well. Overall the tour was very informative and the Swansea village is a very beautiful area in Toronto that I recommend people to go and check it out."

The walks cover neighbourhoods and communities across the city and are offered mostly on weekends from April through October.  Check out Heritage Toronto's website to find out walks that are on offer.",
        "I recently participated in the Thistletown walk - a little known area of the city located in the far northwestern corner.  The walk leader was from the local heritage group and was able to provide an in-depth look into the area's history through the use of photographs, stories and first hand experiences.  We saw some of the oldest standing homes found in Toronto including a beautiful estate where we met the owner.  ",
        "Do try to catch one of the walks - they are free (though donations are very much encouraged) and you won't be disappointed."

Having never fully explored the city, I found the tour of The Beaches quite valuable as it explained how the area developed and changed over the years. The talk was a great balance of history, architecture, and interesting anecdotes.",

        "All of the tours were well attended and the speakers were well prepared with portable amplifiers and pamphlets showcasing the tour highlights. The tours are free and a fabulous way to learn more about our great city, I highly recommend them."

From 1947 when Toronto \"The Good\" issued it's first liquor licenses to the hotels on Yonge St to the mid 70's.  The time before the Eaton Centre and the strip clubs.  Find out how Oscar Peterson met his wife, how black musicians were welcomed in Toronto, how Ronny Hawkins once ruled Yonge Street.  The tour leader come equipped with old posters and pictures, album covers and sound tracks.  Brings you right back!  Loved it."

There are local neighbourhood walks, along with bus tours, bike tours .... really cool. The walks are usually 1 - 2 hours in length, and include the history of the area, who lived where and all sorts of things."

Most tours did not involve stairs and some had access to restaurant washrooms and would work for wheelchairs and strollers as well.."

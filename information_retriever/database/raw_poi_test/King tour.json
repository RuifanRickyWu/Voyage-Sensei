        "We just got back from our tour WOWOWOWOWO!!!  I can't pronounce our pick up driver name sorry  what can we say SHE WAS FABULOUS!!!  And our tour driver. We are SPEECHLESS! Again I can’t pronounce  his name. My sincere apologies to both drivers! He was awesome. And what an excellent driver. He did everything to please his passengers and his knowledge was impeccable! Except for one Dutch or German son and mom that wanted to leave early our driver still did Niagara by the lake and winery drive ! Me and my husband made the choice of no lunch ( even though we paid for it ahead of time , ) for WE wouldnt of had time to do the tunnel and boat tours !That was our choice and we sooooooooooooo want to thank King Tours for a day we will not soon forget for a long time! I was worried after reading some reviews I must admit. King tours were very very first class  AND GREAT TO DEAL WITH. !!!  THANKYOU FOR making one of the better days. THANKYOU",

He asked me how old I was, I told him how old I was and he said wow you're young kid enjoy your life, Now honestly if you're reading this you're probably thinking that's really nice, okay but in my eyes that's really goofy then he said he was 53 like pook honestly I don't give a hoot. Also throughout the trip he constantly chatted on about him having his day off the next day like babe no one cares one bit.",

        "First of all, we were not picked up from the choosen place even though we called three times and they said that they gonna pick us up, however eventually no one picked us up and they said us to walk. When we came to departure place - drivers were not busy, just standing and smoking even though they said that traffic is bad. So they were lying. No communication happened from their side at this point and we were worrying a lot. Moreover, there was only 2.5 hour for free time and there was no time dedicated for Hornblower boat ride seperately. We needed to have this trip on our free time. As well we bought the tickets for journey behind the falls, it means they were informed that we will be going to this attraction during our free time. It was impossible to have two attractions in 2.5 hours of free time as well as have lunch and etc. Even though free time and boat trip was indicated as a separate time measures in their website. Furthermore, no one informed us that there will be no wine tasting, even though information provided in their page - indicates this attraction. Nevertherless, there was no wifi in the bus. This information also included in their page before buying the tickets.",
        "I am complaining of all falls information provided to me in regards to this trip which attracted me to buy tickets from your company. If we would have known that you are providing falls advertisements we would have chose another company."

        "We were expecting free wifi which was not available. We were also expecting a wine tasting and tour which was also not available. It appears that it wasn't even booked?",
        "All these small things may have been tolerable except  at the last stop, we were told we would not be dropped back at our hotel but rather would be dropped off at on the side of the road and would have to walk to our hotel. When we questioned this we were told to order an Uber. ",
        "We ended up walking approximately 45 minutes with our bags to our hotel. It was terrible. Honestly, it was this last item that made me write this review.",
        "Part of the reason we selected the company was the pick up and drop off at our hotel, it was a disappointing experience."

Handling him with kit gloves my husband was able to get him to put us on another tour the next day.  Our guide was Salim and he was wonderful! Very personable and informative. We were picked up at a preset destinations in the morning and dropped where requested on the way home. Amazing customer service!"

We had paid to be picked up and dropped off at our hotel.  He made a big deal about hoping we would get off earlier so he could get home.",
        "We opted for the included meal option, which turned out to be a buffet lunch at the top of the Sheraton hotel.  While the views of the falls are spectacular, if we were to return, we would sort out our own lunch.  The food itself was plentiful and well presented, but it was very very busy.",
        "It is nice to have your tour organised for you when you are from overseas and only have a couple of days in Toronto, and the tour included taking us to the little town of Niagara-on-the-lake, which is charming.",

The bus was spacious and nicely kitted out but not very comfy - I was picked up out of town by an Uber which is fine however it was late and I had to chase up. Altogether an OK tour but I would not recommend."

Afterwards we were headed to the company's office and had to wait forever inside the bus, God knows why. And we even had to hear the tour guide / driver (Salim) said his sorry about the late departure saying that the company were going to pay for the wine tasting, when it was already at the tour package (if that was a joke, I didn't laugh). By the way, all the jokes were really not funny. The bathroom inside the bus were not working. Rest was just ok. But the grand finale was that we were left at some street,  3 km away from our hostel and he didn't say that we get there by ourselves. Just really sad. I don't recommend!"

        "I found King tours online when I was in need of transportation from Hamilton Airport to Downtown Toronto for a concert I was attending with my 17 year old niece and her 2 friends. Our shuttle driver showed up 1 hour past our arrival time.I called a couple of times to ensure he was in fact coming. First time I was told he was only 2-3 minutes away. After waiting 20 minutes I called back again to confirm he had the right pick up destination, was then told he was just entering the airport and would be there very  soon. He arrived 10 minutes after that. I would have appreciated them being honest upon my first call, but that didn't happen. The black suburban that picked us up was clean and roomy, and that's the only positive thing I can say about their service. Once we started out of the airport it was clear he was trying to make up lost time and was driving very aggressively and riding the brakes the whole time, cutting off other cars, almost rear ending a vehicle in front of us multiple times, at one point he slammed on the brakes so hard the 3 girls flew forward I had to ask if they were all ok, all the driver did was giggle and say sorry!! There were a couple of times he hit the steering wheel out of frustration and mumbling under his breathe in his language, he kept driving into the other lane where there were a group of guys on motor bikes they were slowing down to steer into the truck at him, clearly annoyed. We all agreed we weren't comfortable and I wouldn't have used them for the return but I had already booked a return trip and they took payment immediately after booking so I felt I had no choice. However I did email the reservation  desk and informed them of what happened and assured them I wasn't trying to be difficult or get anyone in trouble however we didn't feel safe with that driver and asked if they could send someone else. They apologized and thanked me for informing them of what happened and assured me someone else would be picking us up. You can imagine our surprise when this time they were 20 minutes late and they sent the same driver!!! We had a flight to catch and risked our lives to get back to the Hamilton airport. I was more than annoyed and emailed reservations again to let them know how I felt and that I'd never use their services again and I'd be sure to let others know. They didn't even bother responding. I'm a business owner myself and I'm not one to write negative reviews however I feel this company warrants one! Avoid!"

The driver was very good keeping us up to date on the history of Toronto and showing us the main attractions on our way out of the city. He let us relax on the way back and starting entertaining us at the right time once we were close to returning. Would call king for my tours and they also have good rates to the airport.

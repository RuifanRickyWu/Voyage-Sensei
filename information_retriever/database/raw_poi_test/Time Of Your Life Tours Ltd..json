Our driver Chris was amazing and really looks after his passengers with care.   Weather was a bit dicey on our return but Chris is an excellent driver and got us all home safe and sound.  Looking forward to 2024 and more Time of your LifeTours.   Having a pick up spot quite close to us is an added bonus as we are both seniors."

        "Bus trip to Prince Edward County not well researched. Big Apple included - oops closed Tuesdays and Wednesdays. Stop for shopping in Bloomfield - oops, very few stores on strip and then more than half of the stores are closed Tuesdays and Wednesdays. Why not Piston? Felt bad for the driver who was only informed of these changes a couple of days prior. Long after we had paid for our tour. Rather than 2 minor and small wineries, one decent one like Sandbanks giving full tours, would have been much better.",

        " If you are seeking a great day  trip, and/or a cruise,  or a terrific  indoor-theatre performance,  all generally with a delicious meal with restaurant tips included, that provides  great bus transportation, Time of Your Life Tours is  an excellent choice.",
        "This tour company is operated by folks who I have known for about  15+ years and I only know them by telephone and e-mail. They are very reliable people, and provide exceptional customer service.  Their transportation services are provided by buses and the drivers from Canada Coach bus lines. They have many great trips with very caring bus drivers for single day trips (and  before the pandemic on multiple day trips). This Company always ensures passenger safety, comfort, and enjoyment. It  is a registered member of TICO Consumer travel protection. Full information is available on The Time of your Life , Toronto, website for  all of it services.",
        "A recent example  of an Exceptional trip I have taken with this company - Wednesday, June 22, 2022 (by myself)  -. We had a beautiful bus drive to Burlington to the Piper Arms Pub Restaurant (it was lovely with a beautiful patio). We ate inside. ",
        " Time of your Life patrons felt very comfortable. . Most passengers are very friendly and  everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves immensely. We had our own room for eating at well-spaced tables of 6 people, and the large variety of meals offered were excellent.  Everyone from our group was pleased with the very tasty and generous portions for their lunch. After lunch, we enjoyed a comfortable bus ride over to the very spacious and welcoming Burlington Performing Arts Centre for an absolutely fantastic and very beautiful show of Gotta Sing, Gotta Dance, performed by the spectacular Burlington Footnotes Seniors Group. The performers were so high energy and entertaining  We had excellent  seats (pre-purchased by Time of Your Life)–which were in the  Orchestra section, centre stage,  5th and  6th rows from the stage  although the well- spaced theatre is very popular and It was very well attended. Full details of this show are on The Burlington Footnotes website.",
        " A few other wonderful excursions I took with Time of your Life Tours were:  Bus trips to various waterfront locations for beautifully scenic cruises to Muskoka, to Port Dover, and to Georgian Bay.  Also went to Niagara Falls and enjoyed a great full course  dinner at the lovely Skylon Tower Revolving Restaurant  with a view of the beautiful Christmas Lights while eating at the restaurant,  and then afterwards motoring along  the Niagara Parkway and downtown Niagara Falls  to enjoy all the Christmas lights there.  Also  took very enjoyable summer and fall day bus trips to the beautiful Blue Mountain and Collingwood areas, and  the Peach Festival at Niagara on the Lake. ",
        "Once again, I suggest you do view the Time of Your Life Tours flyers and past brochure/booklets on line, at its website to learn of all this great Tour Company has to offer.",

        "I like this tour company for day trips. The drivers are always so nice. Unfortunately I had some items stolen on my last trip Feb 19/17. I had a fairly large bag stored under the bus with items around the value of $60 American. When I got dropped off to go home, it was gone from the bus, someone had taken it during a previous drop off, I was among the last to be dropped off. I know it was on the bus when we left the last shopping stop because I watched the driver put it underneath the bus myself. It was too large of a bag for someone to make a mistake and take it accidentally. The bag was distinct and didn't look like other bags. Now the loss of the items I can live with but I feel very violated from this experience because I always felt secure on these tours that the people on the bus wouldn't do that. This was the first time this ever happened. It was very upsetting and a terrible end to what was supposed to be a nice day for us. I know TOYL tours aren't responsible, for my loss but I'm just letting everyone know of my experience to be extra careful with their belongings when they are taking these tours. I trusted too much that they would be safe. I will be filing a police report just to have it on the record and because I don't want this happening to anyone else."

        "The Limo was at my front door and delivered me to the Bus pick-up right on time.  Our bus driver, Matt was super, made sure all got on & off safely, our Tour Escort, Lillian makes the ride interesting with Bingo, Trivia and unexpected treats.  All places of interest - The Sugar Shack incl. dinner & entertainment, dinner on top of Montmorency Falls, also Casa Greque dinner of choice, first class.  Our Tour Guide in Montreal was knowledgeable, kind (found a wheelchair for one of our group) & interesting.  She got us into the Notre Dame Cathedral for a tour when it was very busy and we saw a beautiful Wedding Party emerge from the Chapel.  Both Hotels, Best Western in Montreal and Le Concorde in Quebec were great as were the Buffet Breakfasts in each.  One whole day was \"free\" to explore on our own.  All luggage transfers and pickups were timely.  I have nothing negative to say about this trip and look forward to another Time of your life tour."

        "The Wine Me & Dine Me in Niagara tour was a perfect day trip!  Our tour guide was lovely (thanks for a great day, Lillian!) and Michael, our bus driver was terrific with lots of local colour to share along our route.  This was my first trip with Time Of Your Life Tours, but I'm pretty sure it won't be my last.....I'll be on the lookout for other opportunities to travel with them!"

        "My husband and I went on a tour  of a winery, lavender farm and the small town of Bloomfield today with Time of your life tours. While the driver and guide and places visited were excellent, we spent a total of 7.5 hrs on the bus for 4 hrs or less of actual sightseeing. The bus is configured in such a way that there is so little space between your seat and the one in front that you can't stretch or cross your legs. You are staring at the back of a seat 6 inches from your nose for 7.5 hrs. Especially for a senior with knee problems, it was extremely uncomfortable and exhausting The problem is not only the fact that there are too many seats packed into the bus but that the bus goes all over the place picking up an dropping off small groups of people so that you are not on the highway to your destination for quite some time. The tour left at 8 a.m. and returned us to the drop off point at 7.45 p.m.  Prince Edward County is a 2 hour drive from Toronto so this was really unacceptable."

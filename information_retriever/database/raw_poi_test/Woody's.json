        "Avoid this place! The place is very spacious, they have good music and the drag show is good, however yesterday after the Dua Lipa show I ordered two Negronis for $35 which seemed a bit expensive but still acceptable, then I ordered the same thing again and another bartender from the same bar charged me $56 FOR THE TWO NEGRONIS that half an hour before had cost me $35. When I mentioned that his partner had charged me $35 and not $56, he harassed me and forced me to pay, saying that he couldn't do anything and that I had to pay for that. I did it to avoid problems and I understand that they have to make money on concert days like these but this was really an abuse, they charge you what they want and they change the prices"

This time, the bouncer let us in, except my 28 year old friend, on the reason that he was too young to enter. Since we don't go partying with our passports there was no way to prove my friend was 28 years old. One could take this refusal as a compliment (I mean, who wouldn't be mistaken for under 21), but my friend felt bad not being allowed to enter. Why was he allowed in on a friday and not on a saturday? And how old do you have to be to enter Woody's on a saturday, retired? Anyway, we didn't let that spoil the evening and the six of us took our business to another bar in Church Street, where all of us were welcome and we had an amazing night."

Once inside there was still some room to move and dance around. The music was great , the dance floor was really happening . Very high energy all three nights. It was very hot in the bar but what do you expect when when you're surrounded by so many hot men. Special mention to Dave the barmen that served me all three nights : In my view he is the most handsome barmen on Church street and made our Toronto getaway worthwhile just because he served us. Keep on looking good Dave... everyone should ask for you personnaly. Great service and great abs. Thank you..."

But Woody's gleamed like a beacon and drew us in — welcoming atmosphere, nice decor, clean restrooms(!) — a place you could tell had a good energy. On our second night visit, we watched the Sunday drag show from a perch at the bar, and we enjoyed watching the ladies work hard for applause and (sadly few) tips. It was a really enjoyable experience. Of note, one customer who had clearly been drinking a lot got a bit rowdy with another customer, but security swiftly handled the situation and the show went on barely interrupted!",

This Place is truly something different than any other bar/lounge or even club I can say. First thing is first the service is absolutely exceptional!! 10/10 every single time. It is all very good looking men working all bulky but so sweet it is ridiculously marvelous. This is a Gay bar yes but this place would be perfect for anyone regardless sex or orientation. This place is huge absolutely huge and the layout is amazing. This place is huge and it consists of about 5-6 huge rooms and has different style rooms and decoys and a bar in each room, truly unique. The have a major dance floor and there are rooms with tables and one room in the back is like a club. Everything in one. On Halloween they had competitions and on weekends they also do me. This place is always busy and there are always such nice people to talk to and meet , to be honest everyone in this area is so sweet I wish the rest of the city was like that. The drinks here are very well priced and they have the biggest selection I have ever seen of Smirnoff ice cooler flavors and also variety of ciders and a huge selection of beers in cans and bottles. I love this place I have gone back almost every other week for a nice pint. Gets very party mood on weekends. Absolutely great way to spend evening and night drinking and having fun even if you are alone ! Best Bar and establishment in Toronto hands down I cannot gush enough."

        "Various rooms about the place and lots of fun taking place when we visited here on Halloween. Staff and patrons were very friendly and it was great seeing so many people dressed up.",
        "The bar staff were friendly and the drinks reasonably priced.",
        "Only downside is the toilets - there down a very steep set of stairs. I suspect many a drunk queen has taken a tumble these. Also would make using the loo a struggle if you had an injury or disability.",
        "Otherwise, if we return to Toronto, we'll definitely return to Woodys!"

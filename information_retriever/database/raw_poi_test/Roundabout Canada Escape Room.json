We escaped within 22 minutes; however, after exiting we realized we missed several locks because one of the locks in the middle was broken and allowed us to skip half the room. This ruined our escape experience, as evidently the room was not reset property. Further, the escape room itself had no storyline, set up, and the room was smaller and poorly built. What was worse was there was no evident manager on site or available. When we spoke to the front desk, she offered us 10% off our next game, then after further discussion she offered 20% and finally dropped back down to 10% (she did not have proper protocol training on this). There was zero accountability for what had been done, no refund was offered and all of the staff were extremely unprofessional. Definitely my worst escape game experience, a shame it had to be with 7 other friends. Please do yourself a favour (save your wallet) and do not go to this escape room."

This is one of their beginner rooms with a high escape rate, so it's pretty easy if you have a little escape room experience. It was fun nonetheless! Most of the puzzles were number locks, but the method of finding each code varied and was creative, so it didn't feel like we were doing the same puzzle over and over again. The story about the room on the website is different from the story you get once you enter the room, but it doesn't really matter in the end. This room is for 2-8 people, but I think anything beyond 4 will be very cramped - especially in the first room.",

We were in the \"Butcher's Basement\" and could hear the noise in the lobby the entire time. We heard the staff talking and chatting which completely destroyed any 'horror' feel or 'realness'. Moreover, most escape rooms will blind fold you to bring you into the room so it feels like you are literally in the essence of the story and 'trapped' in the room. The person who brought us into the room just simply opened the door from the lobby, walked us in and gave us some rules about the room while we were in it.  Moreover, the experience could have been a lot better if they brought us into a quiet room, gave us the story to make it feel real, spoke about some rules, then led/blind folded us into the room and let us figure it out. I feel like they should have just given us a synopsis of what we can and cannot touch/move around in the room (or put stickers on it) without actually entering with us from the beginning.",

        "The last issue we had with the room was after we got out. It was a pretty lacklustre/non existent after-play experience. We got out of the room and the staff said nothing to us other than \"Have a good night!\". Not even asking how our experience was, congratulating us, asking how we found the room, talk to us about other rooms, etc. It was very uncomfortable and pretty much felt like a get-your-stuff-and-leave-right-away feel. Most escape rooms have a picture booth or something like that, but this place had nothing.",
        "Some pros to the room were that they were were well designed/very scary. It's very clear they put a lot of thought into the design to make it realistic. They were often shrieking moments.",
        "The puzzles were pretty basic so it's a great room for beginners. ",
        "Some real tips to make the experience better:",
        "- Sound proof the room!!!!",
        "- Staff should not enter the room with the players.",
        "-  Staff should also give a back story to the room to the players beforehand and explain anything needed outside the room without going in. ",
        "- Make the hints a little less obvious and more riddle filled. ",
        "- Provide an after-play experience to make the players feel good when/if they get out or even if they don't."

The staff were friendly, and helpful each time had a great experiance.  Solid puzzles, great use of technology, props were on point and the rooms looked amazing. ",
        "If you have done escape rooms before and enjoy them give this one a try you will be amazed. I first read about Final Destination on Narcity and was excited to check it out. Wow great room!! ",

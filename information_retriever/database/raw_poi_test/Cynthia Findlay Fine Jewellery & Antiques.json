        "Myself and my (now) Fiancé went into Cynthia Findlay in October 2017 to look for an engagement ring. The staff were very friendly and listened carefully to what I was asking for, showing me any rings I wanted to try on and making suggestions based on my preferences. I found one that I absolutely loved, but it was significantly over my budget. Cynthia was so kind and accommodating, and assured me that she could have a replica ring made of the one that I loved within my budget. After I made a few small changes (ie: gold colour), we left and booked a follow up appointment to look at diamonds. During the follow-up appointment I really felt that Cynthia understood exactly what I was looking for, and I left everything in her hands, knowing that I could fully trust her with the whole process, and I didn't need to consult with her again. My fiancé pick up the ring in Dec 2018. I cannot stress enough that the ring is even better than I expected, Cynthia went above and beyond our expectations, and we are so happy we chose her to make my dream ring. I HIGHLY recommend going to Cynthia Findlay! "

        "Drove 4 hours to come here because I saw an amazing engagement ring on their website. Paid an arm and a leg for it, and they wanted to charge us to resize it, AND charge us for shipping it. My husband ended up being able to talk them into sizing it for us, and shipping for a smaller fee. There was one staff member who helped us through the process who was lovely, but then Cynthia came over, and the experience took an absolute nosedive. What a rude and unaccommodating woman, we were about to spend over 5k on a ring, and she had the audacity to be rude to my husband, followed by an even worse comment towards me. Gave us a sob story about the man who made the ring (its new, supposedly handmade, with a ‘vintage look’). Made another rude comment, I almost walked out. I fell in love with the ring, I was not about to leave without it. So we paid, got the receipt and appraisal as quickly as possible, and left before something worse could happen. ",
        "Not 48 hours after having my ring sized and back on my finger, a diamond fell out! Our engagement photos were scheduled for the week after, and we called Cynthia in a panic. They offered to replace the diamond and ship back for free. Thank god. The ring setting is platinum, so why a diamond fell out so quickly is beyond me. They blamed it on the sizing, but the setting sits above the band, and would not be affected by the sizing at all. Communication from the store throughout this process was severely lacking.",
        "Fast forward a few months later, another diamond falls out. Called Cynthia, an employee fed us a line about “used jewelry being delicate” ....IT IS NEW!! And platinum should not be delicate. They hung up quickly after saying they wouldn’t do anything about it. ",
        "We brought the ring to our usual jeweller to be fixed. The jeweller said the ring was NOT platinum, the appraisal we were given by Cynthia was inflated by at least 200%, and the centre sapphire stone was was low quality - it has scratched and chipped already. ",
        "So needless to say, not only was this experience stressful, but we got ripped off. Hard. ",
        "Cynthia Findlay and team should be embarrassed. Absolutely disgraceful, I’ve honestly never had a worse experience."

Cynthia was also lovely and told me about the history and details of my ring. They also went above and beyond what was required and put a rush on the resizing and reshanking of the ring and sent out someone early to pick it up so that my fiancee could get the ring in time for when he wanted to propose. Can not recommend them highly enough! Great selection of estate jewellery and exceptional customer service."

        "I would recommend Cynthia to anyone looking for that perfect ring for their partner. When I went there the first time I hardly had a clue as to what it was that I was looking for. Even after researching into the 4 C's, and a lengthy discussion with my partner about the sort of ring that she wanted it's still a very daunting experience find the right ring for the person you want to spend the rest of your life with. ",
        "Cynthia was amazing, she personally took the time to hear me out and take the little information that I had in order to work out what would be best for us. She was patient and efficient and at no point during the several visits did I feel pressured into paying more than I could afford. She went out of her way to recommend that I take a look at the huge variety that she has online and I am so glad that she did. There are rings there for all budget ranges and I was able to go away, take the time to find 8 or 9 that I liked, share them with friends then go back and see them all. When I fell in love with the one I wanted and was sure it was right for me, Cynthia took the time to help me further realise the modifications I wanted to make, work with me to find out what ring size my partner was, and advise me on getting it appraised. ",
        "Between her and her assistant they really helped round out my confidence and isolate the PERFECT ring. The work I had done was excellent, the after care fantastic and the price was exactly as advertised with no hidden costs. More than that they made me confident in my choice and come the big day the look on my fiancé's face was priceless. This is the place to go for that once in a lifetime purchase. I was so happy that I have since returned with my partner so that we could thank her together and Cynthia even took the time to clean the ring for us again and showed us how to maintain it. Fantastic service and value, I can't recommend it highly enough."

        "I can't say enough good things about Cynthia Findlay. I had a ring designed by a different designer and wasn't 100% pleased with the outcome, so I brought it to Cynthia. She spent lots of time going over different options and providing expert advise. I never felt pressure to make a decision or felt she was trying to make a sale. I ended up having a ring made through her designer that I absolutely love. My fiancé and I both ordered our wedding bands from her as well. Great customer service, excellent communication, and helpful and kind staff."

The staff were extremely knowledgeable, patient and friendly. We had set out to see sapphire rings, with a particular style in mind. I had tried on nearly every beautiful ring that she had. Then Cynthia pulled out one that she had just received in that day. We couldn't believe it, but it was exactly what we had in mind and was without a doubt \"the ring\"! It was almost meant to be! We couldn't be happier with our choice and are so thrilled that we stumbled upon this wonderful store! You could literally spend days in Cynthia's store and be constantly in awe of her treasures.",

        "We had a great experience here. Before shopping, my only prerequisite for our rings was that they had to be vintage. Both Now Magazine and Blog T.O. listed Cynthia Findlay as a preferred option. We found an engagement ring and two wedding bands during a fun and relaxed visit, trying many to be certain we were happy with our selections. We arranged a deposit and a layaway. During the layaway period, we asked for photos, arranged for a new shank on the engagement ring, and then settled our account early to have the rings for Valentine's Day. All of these requests were handled by Cynthia in a quick and friendly manner.",

Both Yanina and Komsak were incredible.  Excellent technique and very friendly.  We both agreed that the massages we had were the best we've ever experienced.  The spa itself is quite nice inside.  They have a great relaxation area with large hot tub and sauna that you can enjoy before or after your treatments and the change rooms are well appointed.  Sasha, the front desk concierge was excellent to deal with in booking the appointments and checking us in and out when we were there.  Love this spa and will return again."

The atmosphere is lovely and soothing and the relaxation room is very calming. I had a relaxation massage with Gabriela, a trained therapist. She is truly phenomenal and the reason for the high review. She fixed some very stubborn pain points on my neck and back that were not allowing me to enjoy my trip to Toronto as much. The pain disappeared afterwards and I felt like a weight had been lifted off my shoulders. If I lived in Toronto I would probably come to the spa once a month. Visiting this spa is a must when in Toronto, especially on a cold or rainy day when there is little to do outside. The prices are also very reasonable compared to other spas."

I then had an hour long hot stone massage! Gabriela was the RMT who I had the pleasure of being with for my almost 2 hour long service. She was absolutely AMAZING!!! I would give her a 10 star rating if I could. You can tell she is a very experienced therapist and knows exactly what she is doing. I have never felt so amazing after a spa service!!!! Highly recommend this treatment and ask for Gabriela. The spa itself was so cozy and has a nice relaxing atmosphere. Following my spa treatment I relaxed in the hot tub with a nice glass of cucumber water. Upon arrival, the front desk was so welcoming and made me instantly feel welcomed and comfortable. Highly recommend this spa!!!! Can't wait to go back one day when we are back in Toronto!"

SpaZen was gracious enough to squeeze us in despite a full schedule. We each had a one-hour massage and spent the time waiting alternately in the spa jacuzzi and sleeping a bit in the relaxing environment of the waterfall room where the jacuzzi is located along with some tea and cucumber water for hydration. Gabriela was our masseuse, and --wow!- she was amazing. Strong yet relaxing.

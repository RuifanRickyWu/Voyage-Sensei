        "He was outside our hotel ahead of time and the car ride was very comfortable and he was an excellent driver and gave us interesting bits of information along the way.",
        "We spent a very full day in Niagara exploring many of the sights including the skyline tower ( both early morning and at night ) and the boat trip and the power station and at each point Vlad would drop us at the entrance and be waiting for us to take us to the next attraction. We also went to the rapids for a walk and to the cable car ride which were a few miles further down the river which Vlad suggested and I think I would have missed if Vlad hadn’t suggested them. They were also highlights of the trip . I would definitely recommend a trip to Niagara Falls with Vlad.",
        "Ps. He also drove us to Buffalo, USA at our request to go to an amazing contemporary art gallery AKG which I would highly recommend and we managed to squeeze it in instead of Niagara on the lake , which I also hear is worth a visit."

        "We used Vlad as our driver for a day trip to Niagara Falls and the surrounding area.  He was knowledgeable about things to do in and around the Falls, and was able to provide both historical and geological background information about the Falls.  He was particularly knowledgeable about the infrastructure of the area, and the power and industrial importance of the falls.  He willingly accommodated our, perhaps less common, desires to walk around the nearby Dufferin Islands and other natural areas.  He was also quite patient with our wine tasting urges.  When we could not get into one winery, he was waiting nearby and quickly picked us up to take us to our next adventure.  He gave us plenty of time for our visits to our various points of interest, but also remained ready to move us on to the next attraction."

He was in front of our hotel at the agreed upon time and very flexible (as advertised). We went to Niagara Falls and did the two attractions we wanted and went off to visit 3 wineries and Niagara on the Lake. We felt the trip was a great value and allowed us to maximize our day and do exactly what we wanted. Vlad was so accommodating and so nice! Highly recommend!"

        "We booked with Vlad for the Flexible Niagara Falls Tour from Toronto for Sunday 6/9/24, based on excellent Tripadvisor reviews. Vlad’s approach to touring is just what we wanted: he provides the transportation and is a knowledgeable guide; we decide what to do and see. Compared to other package tours, his flexible approach allowed us to customize our one-day trip to just the sites we wanted with as much time as we wanted. He suggested some of the “must see” places without a hard sell and based on our selection, he recommended an itinerary.",
        " ",
        "Vlad picked us up at our hotel promptly at 8 a.m. on Sunday. His car is very clean and comfortable. He’s also a great driver! As we traveled toward Niagara Falls, he pointed out features and history along the route. He took us right to the door of the Skylon Tower and then to the Niagara Welcome Center where we viewed the Falls and took in the Journey Behind the Falls tour and the Power Station + Tunnel. Throughout the day, Vlad linked up with us via text message for pickup times and locations. Besides Niagara Falls, we asked him to take us to the quaint town of Niagara-on-the-Lake where we spent several hours for a leisurely dinner and shopping. Along the way there he showed us various sites of interest.  Our day ended with the return trip to our Toronto hotel. It didn’t seem like a long drive as Vlad kept the conversation going on a wide range of topics. Vlad is courteous, knowledgeable and we highly recommend his Flexible Niagara Falls tour without hesitation!!",

From his timely pick-up at our hotel to his knowledge about the entire Niagara Falls area, we were well taken care of. He helped us decide what to do and what to see. We used the WhatsApp to communicate when and where we needed to be picked up. Our day went as smooth as silk. He even took us to Niagara On The Lake for lunch. His cool and calm demeanor was extremely pleasant. He is a very safe driver. He gave us numerous options of things to do and see without any time pressure.  He was there for us and for whatever we wanted to do. We highly recommend Vlad for a great tour and a great day."

        "During our Toronto visit, exploring Niagara Falls with Vlad's private tour was a real treat. The personalization of being picked up from our hotel set the tone for a day designed just for us. Conversing with Vlad was enjoyable; his knowledge spanned the essential facts about the Falls as well as some delightful lesser-known insights. The convenience of arranging pickups and drop-offs with a simple text message made everything feel effortless. Our day was packed with the quintessential Niagara experiences – a helicopter ride, the historic power plant, the tunnels, and the 'Behind the Falls' tour, each enhanced by the privacy and ease of our bespoke tour. The views from the Skylon Tower were a highlight, and a peaceful visit to Niagara-on-the-Lake perfectly concluded our adventure. An unexpected highlight was Vlad showing us a large beaver lodge, a testament to his knack for sharing unique natural sights alongside the main attractions. We ended our day back at our hotel, enriched by the memories and the exceptional service Vlad provided."

        "This was an amazing trip to Niagara Falls and surrounding areas made special by being able to stop off and move on as suits you. The convenience of being collected from and dropped off at our hotel was most helpful . Our driver Vlad sets the bar high for any tour guide- extremely knowledgeable and informative about the area and about the country in general, exceptionally helpful and friendly and his recommendations were really great. As well as Niagara Falls & Skylon Tower he took us to the picturesque Niagara-on-the-lake,  stopping at key vantage points. Booking this trip was worth every penny - comfortable, thoroughly enjoyable and amazing to be able to customise your day to suit you. A true gentleman and a great driver too! We cannot recommend this tour highly enough! Made our first day in Canada a stand out and very special and memorable."

Vlad added as much history and good information as we desired and was very responsive to checking on other options of things we mentioned.

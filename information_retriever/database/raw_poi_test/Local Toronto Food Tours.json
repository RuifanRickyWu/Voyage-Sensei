You are introduced to seven restaurants by your tour guide Joseph, who is knowledgeable about the area, likeable, and genuine. In addition to tasting and experiencing the food, you learn about the restaurants' origins and how those histories are entwined with those of the surrounding neighbourhoods and the city. Going off the usual tourist track allows you to find hidden jewels that you would be very unlikely to find on your own and certainly not all in one afternoon. An intimate look into Toronto, which is energetic, friendly, and colourful. Additionally, it offers excellent value, especially with the current reduction. I heartily urge everyone to try this!"

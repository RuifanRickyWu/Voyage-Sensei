But now he'll hang the phone up and if I don't have $2 extra to book a ride the phone gets hung up. The man is not what he seems to be and I am very upset he can't even take medical insurance because he want me to requirements and that concerns me very greatly that people are riding with him I mean I just don't understand how he can pretend to be so friendly and so hateful in his heart"

        "On February 4, 2022, I headed to the airport with an Uber driver to charge far more than the usual $ 107 the forecasted snow storm was rain. There was no traffic problem getting to the airport. The problem was with the driver who got lost. He drove me into some kind of freight operation and he had to figure out how to get to the airport from there. I had to help him. He didn’t know where terminal three was. I had to help him with that. We took a very long time to get to the airport slowing me down for customs. It’s been a lot of time and effort trying to Contact Uber on the app and got an unsatisfactory response. do it tried contacting Uber on my telephone but couldn’t find them. I couldn’t message Uber from my app either and couldn’t find out how to do that. While on my trip away from Canada Months later Uber decided to charge my credit card with a zero balance. My credit card contacted me and asked me if I authorize that charge I said I didn’t then they had to cancel my no credit card. Once again I couldn’t get a hold of Uber to find out why they made this o charge on my credit card when I wasn’t even in the country The cancellation of my credit card created plenty of problems including extra charges from my storage area and no cell phone when I returned my back into Canada. It was a highly stressful event and I still can’t speak or have this situation explained to me about Uber because I can’t get hold of them. I am very discouraged by Uber and I’m not giving my credit card to them or any other transportation company on an ad hoc basis. They can’t be trusted and you can’t get any consumer satisfaction from Uber when they make these major mistakes"

        "I took a trip with Emery mobility and gave them my credit card. Two days later I got a call from Danny who said he was I  the collection department. He said my credit card was declined even though I had over 7 thousand dollars in it. I have used the same card with Emery on numerous trips before with no problem. I gave him another visa card and that was rejected too so I gave him another one which was not going through either so I gave him my last of four credit cards and he said if this one didn't go through he would put my account into collections and it would have an impact on my credit score. It did go through but I told him that he has a logistics problem and that I had called all my bank cards and they all said no one had tried to access my account at all. So I called Sarah at Co-op cabs which apparently is the boss of Emery Mobility and left a message for her to call me. Well that was three weeks ago so I guess that was another waste of my time. I read reviews from Co-op cabs and Sarah is mentioned no less than 12 times of her not returning calls about complaints.",
        "I actually found another company in my area that will do it for $40 less than Emery so Emery can stick their Mobility Bus where the sun don't shine. I was gunna say ass but I thought I would show a little more class than Emery does."

        "As I walked out my building  I saw there was a taxi blocking my car in.  No big deal I thought, he's just dropping somebody off   I walked out, put stuff in the passenger side, walked around to the drivers side and got in.. then waited.... no idea what was taking so long but the passenger finally got out, waved to me and said \"sorry\".  The taxi just sat there... after a minute or so I honked my horn, the driver turned and looked at me and continued sitting there.  After another minute or two I honked my horn again.. no movement.  All the taxi driver had to do was pull up 10 feet so I could get out.   At this point I walked up to the drivers window and asked if he was going to move.  The drivers said \"**** OFF\"  I again asked if he was going to move his car because he was blocking me in, he said to me \"you are a racist\"   I asked him how i could be a racist when I had said nothing to him about his culture, skin colour, heritage.. his response was \"you are a ****ing racist\"  I said just move your car so I can go... his response was to begin screaming \"you are a racist, racist\" at me non stop.. People were looking at us and he said \"now you have an audience\"  I yelled at him to just move his  car and he finally did.."

        "I was picked up by a drunk driver in Yorkville going to Union Station.  On the ride he went up to very high speeds of 100 almost hitting other cars and pedestrians.  I was not able to jump out at red lights because the door was locked and he would not allow me to exit.  When we arrived he refused to let me out until I paid.  I paid and was finally let out and while trying to take a picture of his licence plate he tried to run me over with his car.  This was a very traumatizing but learning experience for me.  I called 911 and reported the incident to the police and was informed that the driver was arrested because he picked up another passenger who called 911.  I did not pursue this any further with the police and was satisfied that he was going to be charged.  However, I contacted the company to ensure that the driver would not be allowed to endanger another life.  I received and email response from Customer Service after writing the CEO and Manager in Toronto.  This response was despicable considering the seriousness of this matter.  They did not even offer a refund for the $20 I paid for my $8 ride.  I will NEVER recommend this company."

        "Take Beck Taxi or be a normal human and take an uber! At work, I have had 2 bad experiences in a row with agressive/dangerous Coop drivers. Rude, distracted , checking cellphones, not checking blind spots etc. These are not professionals. One didn't know where to go but said he did. He cut off a car so badly the other driver had to slam on his breaks. He did that last minute just to get off the DVP S. at Wynford Dr. Rolled down his window to swear at the driver while holding up traffic at a green light at the end of the ramp. He could have just gotten off at Eglington SAFELY and gotten me to same destination on Don Mills. Gave me attitude for not tipping too. WTF, Uber for the win, end this taxi mafia in this town. Both cabs were old, dirty, beat up with dings and scratches. Can't find a single good thing to say about Co-op. Many good experiences with BECK taxi and Uber's"

The driver finally answered and played mind games with me for 9 hours and 15 phone calls later about how he may return my phone for a price. First it was $20.00, then a few hours later it was $30.00, the it went up to $40.00.  ",

For the amount of cell phones I've returned when found, Karma didn't pay me back.  And ironically enough, the next day I looked down in a chair in my hotel lobby and found a cell phone.

        "I was at the Wolf Lebovic Building of Mt. SINAI Hospital and needed to get to Union Station to catch a Via Train. There was a direct phone in the lobby of the building so I called and asked for a cab. They took my name and cell number and told me it would take 5-10 minutes. A message on my cell said they had dispatched a cab at 3:05 pm. I was in severe pain and having difficulty standing. After about 20 minutes I went back in the building and climbed upstairs to the phone again. This time they told me that they were busy but a cab had been despatched and should be there soon. I continued to wait and many of their cabs came and went. Shortly after 4pm a cab from Beck pulled over and asked if I was looking for a ride. I gave up on their company and left with Beck. I never did receive a call from the first company saying that they were there and looking for me. I am lucky I didn't miss my train."

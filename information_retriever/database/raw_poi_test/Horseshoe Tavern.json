Three of us came to the 'Shoe in the afternoon to check out the venue before the concert and the staff were very friendly and welcoming.  Strongly recommended for anyone who sees themselves as a fan of Blue Rodeo and/or The Tragically Hip (\"The Hip\").  As a Hip fan, it was very cool to see where 5 members of Canadian Rock Royalty got their start, and they have a fantastic looking mural in the concert area (a fitting tribute to Gord Downie).  Hip fans should watch for a picture featuring (a very young) Rob Baker, Gord Downie, Johnny Fay, Paul Langlois and Gord Sinclair.  You'll be able to recognize it from somewhere ;)."

This is a Toronto landmark, and is part of what makes this city the envy of the rest of Canada, especially when it comes to music and art. Whether you are at the bar at the front, or on the small patio, it is likely to be busy. We went on a Tuesday for a concert, and the place was jumping. And those people weren't going to the show. So many legendary bands have played here, and the place is seeped in history. The bands that play here know that, and their performances tend to reflect their respect for the venue and those who have come before them. Sadly, the area around the Horseshoe gentrified in the 80s (Queen West) and, basically, it is only tourists and suburbanites who frequent Queen and Spadina these days, unless you have a show to go to. We went to see Rolling Blackouts Coastal Fever. The concert space holds about 400 people, and it can get pretty jammed, and it was that night. On a Tuesday! I prefer to be near the stage, but you can stand elsewhere and sight-lines are amazing, except for one pillar. The space is so intimate and warm. But it is the sound that puts it in the Massey Hall category. It is immaculate. And the band is right in your face. The bar can get busy, but prices are very reasonable, and pours are heavy. Check out the history, and become part of the history."

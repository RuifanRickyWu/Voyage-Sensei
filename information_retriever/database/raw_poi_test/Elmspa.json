        "My mom, my mother-in-law and my daughter (for her 13th birthday!) and I spent a Saturday afternoon at the Elmspa. What a delight!! I have been to the ElmWOOD spa several times (also wonderful), but had never ventured over to this peaceful oasis. I had no idea! Since there were four of us and only one RMT and one aesthetician we essentially had the whole place to ourselves. Nicky at reception was so friendly and helpful, and we could not speak more highly of Kamelia (aesthetician), and Andre (RMT - best massage ever!!). There is no water therapy, but the steam room in the woman's washroom was more than enough to feel cleansed! Will definitely be going back. Oh, one thing... bring snacks if you will be there for a while. There is no food. Lovely tea though!"

I highly recommend this small spa on Church St, which is the sister location to the Elmwood Spa on Elm St.  The staff were so warm, friendly and knowledgeable. The facilities were pristine! The decor is so calm, sophisticated but unpretentious. I enjoyed a 25 min infrared sauna before my Elmline Essential facial, which included a premium masque and eye treatment. Loved it and will absolutely be going back."

        "My 4-star rating for Elmspa is focused mainly on the beautiful venue and friendliness of the staff. A lovely little oasis in downtown Toronto, and the prices are more affordable than other spas! My friend and I visited on a Friday afternoon (my treat). Elmspa was easy to find. We had ring up to the third floor to be let into the building, and an elevator whisked us up to the spa. The receptionist was friendly and welcoming, offered us a choice of tea or cucumber water while we filled out our first-visit forms.",
        "The women's change room was small (only one small bench) but clean and well-maintained. We were provided with robes, towels and slippers. We were invited to use the steam room, which we did - lovely! We also both loved the infared sauna, which had been preheated for us.",
        "After the sauna, we waited out the Garden space -- SO nice! Elmspa has made wonderful use of such a small space. I've been to many spas during travel and this space really did a wonderful job of capturing the peaceful and calming atmosphere of the high end bigger spas.",
        "re: services. I have read many glowing reviews of the Elmspa services on TripAdvisor, so I am going to assume that my experience was unique. My friend was also very happy with services, had no complaints. My massage, however, was not what I had hoped. I suspect that the massage therapist was distracted or had something else on his mind during my session? It's the only reason I can think of, given the rave reviews about his massages on TripAdvisor. He didn't seem to remember what I had asked him to focus on during the massage, seemed to be in a hurry at the end, wanting to wrap things up.",
        "Again, however, I've seen others praise his massage services here on TripAdvisor, so I suspect my session was an exception. And my friend was very happy with her massage, which was given by the same person.",
        "I also had my first facial ever! It will also be my last facial...but that's personal preference, not the fault of the woman giving the facial. I did learn a lot about facials, especially what I should be doing that I'm not. :-) My friend enjoyed hers.",
        "After I paid up and my friend and I were putting our coats on, a homeless man arrived in the elevator - he was naked beneath his long coat (we could tell because his coat was open). Apparently he had buzzed up and lied about having an appointment. The receptionist spoke to him with courtesy but firmness, asking him if he would please leave. When he didn't, she said she would have to call security, and that's when he finally left.",
        "I was impressed by the receptionist's professionalism in dealing with the situation, but also the courtesy with which she spoke to the homeless man. Apparently (this was confirmed by people I talked with in the ground floor lobby) the building has had problems with the homeless finding ways into the building, some of whom have stolen items from some floors. A sad situation.",
        "Given the rave reviews on TripAdvisor about Elmspa, I would like to come back sometime."

I contacted them very last minute and wasn't able to book a massage but I got a pedicure and some time in the infrared sauna. The pedicure was fine and I wish you were able to book a proper block of time in the infrared saunas as they are a very good treatment in themselves. It would also be better if they were turned on and fully warmed up before use to maximise the benefits and value for the client."

The Garden space outside is just heavenly and I can't imagine how gorgeous it will be during Summer. As soon as you walk in, there is a nice welcoming vibes with lovely scent. Shemane took time to show me around and gave me many suggestions of what I could for future visits; she has great customer service. My message therapist during that day, Mohsea, was educated and he knew how to work around the tight muscles. It was just exactly what I needed after a stressful year. Thank you AND you will definitely see more of me with friends and families!"

I usually have to ask the RMT to use the lightest touch possible, but with Peter I didn't have to (it was like he just knew!).

We're tourists, and have been to over 120 countries, we avoid carrying cash. TBH, not sure I know anyone who carries cash these days, but perhaps this is something in Toronto.

        "Woodbine Beach is the largest of the four beaches in the Beaches in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Located along Lake Shore Boulevard at the foot of Woodbine Avenue, it is next to Ashbridge's Bay and Kew-Balmy Beach. It‚Äôs a very nice vast beach area with places to play volleyball, a boardwalk to walk on, a beach area and a really nice wooded area to walk through, a very enjoyable time just relaxing and strolling through the park and watching the scenery. There is a bicycle rad along the boardwalk extending to the east and west and connecting other parks and water front. A huge beach sandy area with many beach volley ball courts. Parking available - Free parking during the week before 5PM. Nice sand, grass areas, change house, renovated bathing station features upgraded ventilation and lighting, a new roof, an enlarged patio, change rooms, accessible washrooms, water bottle filling stations and a beach shower with a foot wash, and Tim Horton's on sight as well as other food places. The beach itself is fine, with lifeguards on duty during the summer. Beautiful views of the lake."

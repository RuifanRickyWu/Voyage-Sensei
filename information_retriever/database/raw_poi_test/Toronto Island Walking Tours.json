  "description": "Get away from it all. Join us for a 1.5 hour walking tour of the unique and charming residential community on Toronto Island, only a 12-minute ferry ride from downtown Toronto. As two longtime residents, we can tell you what it's really like to live year round in the middle of an 525-acre park with no stores or cars. We'll show you cottage-like homes, lush gardens ad beautiful green spaces. Our tour is led by both Susan and Linda, longtime Island residents and costs $25. The pace is leisurely and terrain is flat. Sign up on Eventbrite or go to our website at walkwardsisland.com We meet you at the white gazebo at the ferry docks on Wards Island. Enjoy a coffee or snack/meal before or after our tour at the Island Cafe or Riviera Cafe. We look forward to greeting you and showing you our community!",

We learned so much about the island, and Susan's willingness to share her personal experiences and answer all of our questions made the experience even more special. I highly recommend this tour for corporate groups or friends looking for a fantastic way to explore the island. Thank you, Susan and Linda!"

        "On a 3 day visit to Toronto I was looking for a tour my wife may enjoy when I came upon the Ward Island tour hosted by Linda and Susan.  When I saw their photo I knew this would be perfect for my wife and me. And it was!  We booked it just for the two of us but the ladies have done tours of many sizes. This is truly a unique setting with beautiful views of the Toronto skyline and certainly a rather unique lifestyle. The communication arranging the tour for a Monday morning was excellent with very specific instructions on the ferry transport to the islands (Ward is one of a cluster of 3 islands). The City ferry and water taxi’s are the only way there therefore understanding how to get there is very important. Linda and Susan met us at the ferry stop and off we went on a 90 minute walking tour. They took turns explaining the history of the island with some photo aids. The lifestyle is fascinating and my wife and I were filled with questions as we walked and they talked and since it was just the 2 of us we fired away. It was like meeting old friends who were proud to show us their homes. As we walked they greeted and were greeted by other residents. Yes, everyone knows each other. There are no autos on the island. Lots of bicycles. And a sailing club with many nice sailboats I recognized as a former boat owner. And we saw many visitors and school children and seniors enjoying a beautiful day. We bid our hosts farewell back near the start and had lunch at the cafe near the ferry. The trip back on a much less crowded ferry gave us another chance to view the city skyline and take great photos. Thanks to Linda and Susan"

Island residents Linda and Susan take you on a stroll past garden cottages, canals, lakefront boardwalk, and picturesque views of downtown Toronto. You learn about this special community that was almost forced to abandon the island half a century ago before more enlightened politics prevailed. Thank goodness, because this is now one of Toronto's premiere charms. For a special treat, consider staying in one of the island's lovely B&Bs, and end your tour with a delicious meal at The Rectory or the Island Cafe."

        "Yesterday we 32 active seniors spent the morning with Susan and Linda in their idyllic community of Ward's island and Algonquin island.  Pre planning with them was easy, efficient and felt oh so good when we by-passed the enormous lineups to buy Ferry tickets as Linda had suggested we book our tickets on line.  These two delightful  ladies showed us the hidden charms of a part of Toronto you would never dream existed.  No cars, no shops, people saying hello to neighbours and the gardens you would expect to see in an English village. All our questions were answered, the pace adjusted to the heat, and recommendations made for lunch at the Rectory, which was exceptional.  I would highly recommend \"Walk Ward's island,\"  for anyone young or old, who wants to experience a unique part of our wonderful city. I'll be taking out of town visitors  to meet these two delightful gals, and enjoy another day \"over the water\" on Ward's island. ",

        "As a fourth generation Torontonian , and someone who actually grew up in this city,  it is sad to see the state that this library is in now. The pond as you walk in  is non-functional , and the library is full of vagrants and homeless people looking for somewhere warm to sleep, because the shelter system is ineffective and over-run. Pre-pandemic,  I used to spend many hours here studying because I loved all of the natural light coming in and how there were so many cozy/quiet spots to study in; however there are many perverts who come in and harass young female students as this has happened to me numerous times. There is a lot of theft so don’t leave anything unattended. And this particular library has a huge bedbug problem so be careful about where you sit or put your personal belongings (I once left my knapsack on the carpeted floor beside me  and witnessed a bedbug trying to crawl into my bag- I squished it with a Kleenex and blood came out). I showed the librarian and she admitted they had a huge infestation on the fourth floor. Be careful where you sit! I found studying with earphones in prevented creepy men from trying to talk to me so that helps! Good luck! "

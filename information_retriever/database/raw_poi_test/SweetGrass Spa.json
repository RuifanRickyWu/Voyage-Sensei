        "We came for a much-needed day of rest and relaxation, and couldn't have been happier with the service and facilities. It was perhaps the best facial I've ever had  and the body polish and massage were very soothing. Lunch was a very filling and delicious salad and a glass of wine - gelato was also offered but the salad was plenty. The pool area was wonderful, especially on a cold wintery day - it was as warm and humid as a trip to the tropics and felt like a true vacation. I will be back!"

Staff was pleasant. But…. There was some sort of class in the pool when I arrived. Hot tub is small and 2 people already in it. Sauna looked like a small portable one. 2 people in it and it was full. Lunch was a joke. Salad with a small piece of salmon. Prosecco showed up half way through. Asked for napkin and never did get one. This was $35!! No coffee or dessert. I was still hungry after. Thought I would try the hot tub and sauna after treatments but 2 people in each and no room for me so I left. $530 was too much for this even in Toronto."

The beautiful lounge area provided such a retreat feel I could have hung out there all day, next time I am going to bring a book and take advantage of the serenity.  The pool and jacuzzi also provides a quiet area to lounge.  I thoroughly enjoyed my pedicure and parafin treatment, Natasha has a super personality.  My aunt had a facial with Robby and had the same great experience with her service.  I cannot truly describe the peace I felt while I was there, for someone who has a great deal of difficulty slowing down, my mind actually settled.  It was a great experience overall and I cannot wait to go back!"

      "text": [
        "The worst spa experience. I brought my friend there for a relaxing spa day as part of a bachelorette party and it was the worst mistake. They messed up both on her nails, my nails and on all of the bridesmaids’ individual bills. We asked them to split the bride’s bill for us so we can cover her costs and they for some reason would not give us a receipt with a proper breakdown of costs. They made a bunch of mistakes during the whole experience. They gave me regular polish when I booked shellac. I had told them it’s okay, just make sure I’m not charged with shellac but they charged me anyway. The nail salon gave the bride instructions to wait an hour for her nails to dry and 20-30 min for my nails to dry. We both waited one hour before showering and of course the nails were scratched up and dented afterwards. They don’t have the proper equipment in their nail salon because typically nail technicians put your nails under a fan to dry but they didn’t. They asked the bride to come back to get it fixed but refused to hold a spot for her the next day unless she could confirm her schedule on the spot (the bride lives an hour and a half away and it’s the week of her wedding so she would need time to re-arrange her schedule to make it happen). They said it would be “taking away” from another customer if they held the spot for her and she wasn’t able to make it, even though their mistake is the reason why she needed to come back in the first place. When I checked my bill I told the front desk that my meal is charged incorrectly because it seemed like a lot more than what I ordered. She kept insisting it was correct without actually checking. Finally, I told her I didn’t mean to be difficult, but just wanted to be sure and asked to look at the lunch menu again and found out that they had indeed charged me with the wrong meal. She then proceeded and said, “well, what you had on your plate was this salad instead”, even though I repeatedly told her I had ordered the daily salad and asked if the amount was correct. At that point it seemed like she was just trying to argue back to defend herself from upset customers who were rightfully disappointed. She then accused me of lying when I told her that the nail technician told me to wait 20-30 min even though I waited an hour before taking a shower and said that she had spoken to the technician and was told a different story. I asked her what the technician told her and she refused to explain. Again, a proper nail salon should have a fan to dry the nails but this one didn’t have one for some reason even though the service is not cheap at all. We ended up staying there all day to get the bills sorted out properly and for the bride to finally get her nails fixed. Having to deal with this poor service took so much time that it actually cut into the other activities we had planned for the bride’s relaxing day. I would highly discourage anyone from going there."

Called to cancel 23 hours prior to appointments. They said i would still incur the full charges as i was not the one sick and they must have 24 hours notice!!!!! Was worried for friend and may have had to assist if things were not well. Talk about a stressful start to a spa day. Not what we had in mind at all. Friend even offered to pay for pool access while i had my treatments however even then the receptionist said no as need to book $100 minimum for access. Friend was able to come and get a modified treatment as she was a trooper and didn’t want me to get charged but manager only said girl at desk was new and did not even offer a complimentary coffee or tea as compensation for the stress.  Maybe some sensitivity training for new staff would help. Not an excuse. This spa was a recommendation from some regulars who will NOT return after this . Focus should be customers not bottom line. Not recommend as they are not at all accommodating or empathetic."

        "Disappointing experience.  On the positive side, the massage was decent and the lounge had a certain low-key charm.  The water therapies are a bit dated and limited to be sure, but honestly the front desk staff was what made a \"meh\" experience absolutely unacceptable (particularly at the price).  ",
        "The receptionist/front desk person managed to ignore me for 15 minutes when I was trying to check in -- there were zero other customers, but apparently even a nod or a \"just a moment please\" was too much to expect as she continued on the phone for 15 mins while I was standing right in front of her.",
        "The checkout was actually comical it was so bad - several guests were waiting to checkout and the front desk seem to continue to go as slow as possible, ignoring the number of people waiting.  I actually went back to the lounge to sit for 15-20 mins, came back, and the same people were still waiting.  It ended up taking close to 30-35 minutes before I could check out (no acknowledgement of the wait, nothing except annoyance at having to check me out).  Then getting the RMT receipt took 3 different tries - the staff member handed me a half-filled oddly informal receipt (missing amount, missing date, missing invoice number, nevermind missing any official stamp/logo/spa indicator).  When I asked if she could fill it in fully, I got a stare then an exasperated sigh, and she added the date and handed it back.  I pointed out that several fields were still missing, could she fill them in? Rinse and repeat 3 separate times.  ",
        "Really surprisingly bad service especially galling at $200+ for a simple massage, really unacceptable.  Reading some of the other reviews on Google reviews etc, it seems this wasn't a one-off bad day for the front-desk staff either.  So many better options in downtown Toronto for nice spas with competent and pleasant service - will be avoiding this place from now on."

        "Pros:  Both of our massages were absolutely fantastic! One of the better massages both of us have had.  My friend also loved her facial.  She thought the esthetician was extremely attentive and had nothing but praises for the treatment.  The lobby and lounge area are very pretty.  All of the staff were lovely and attentive. It was lovely to sit with glasses of wine in the lounge after our treatments.",
        "Cons:  The mani-pedi was ruined before I even left the spa.  I have to say that this is the 2nd time I've had a mani-pedi in a high-end spa where they don't put dryers on, and only use the spray, and both times I've found this highly ineffective.  My nails were not close to being dry though I was very careful.",
        "The spa was also not nearly as 'swanky' as I would have expected, particularly as the spa is within a very exclusive women's club.  Tiny change room.  The hydrotherapy was not so great - I can't believe people pay $50 for it without treatments.  The whirlpool had tons of foam which we weren't sure was  residue from other clients body lotions or whether it was supposed to be there.  The tiny sauna, just sitting on the pool deck looked cheap...and the worst part - it was so loud in the pool - not because of customers, but from the spa's own 'lifeguard/instructor' teaching a private lesson during our lounging time.  I tried to sleep in a lounge chair & was woken up from her yelling!",
        "Upon leaving, we were surprised when my friend's visa gift card was declined several times.  We found out later, from calling visa, that the gift card, when used in a spa must be charged for a cost lower than the card's value, so one cannot top up the card's value with cash.  (so if the treatment is $300, the spa cannot enter a $200 Visa gift card against the fee & allow the guest to pay the extra $100.) Not the spa's fault, but I'm surprised that a spa wouldn't know this information.  One would think that they would be a destination for Visa gift card users.....",

No hot wax was provided in the pedicure deal which was very expensive therefore, you think it would have been. The room lighting was dark therefore, I thought I had selected a pink but instead it was an orange. No massage chairs, instead sitting was quite uncomfortable with no head rest. After awaiting the completion of my friends pedicure, waiting for lunch, then consuming lunch I had a perfect pedicure however, I awoke the next morning to my pedicure looking terrible - along with my friends as well (evidently it was not dry but we did not understand how it could not have been dry after at least 2 hours) in which this has never happened to me before.  Overall, very disappointed with this spa, mainly due to the fact that it is a higher end spa, with higher prices yet the end result was the result of a cheap spa experience."

        "Today I visited this spa for the first time and honestly didn’t think much of it. I have been to better and cheaper too. Anyway",
        "- when I arrived I was immediately shown a locker and got my robe and slippers. Staff was professional and courteous. Told me to go to the lounge and would have a form for me to fill in. Realized after she left I didn’t know where the lounge is. The place is a bit of a maze with lots of doors most of which are unmarked. Anyway found lounge. Girl took my form and left. No tour. No indication of what happens next ie is this where my therapist would collect me? (Answer yes)",
        "- the lounge was cozy although busy with staff passing back and forth all the time (didn’t see a lot of clients). It’s a dark pinkish color with pipes guvhbg an industrial feel ceiling. You can tell it’s in the basement. Lots of chairs and tables to lounge in. No clock. So eventually I go ask for a tour as I have no idea where the pool is. The lounge has water teas and coffee available round one of its corners (not instantly obvious either). Selection of magazines. Wine menu for sale on each table. No sign of a lunch menu but it’s 11.30am so too early?",
        "- the pool is as pictured in reviews. A very warm room a bit dark and dated colors and the pool is a murky green. In the basement too so no windows and again a touch of an industrial feel. Wasn’t appealing. There is an underwater treadmill and bike in it which is cool. A good selection of pool loungers.",
        "I hear a cough and sneeze and then the massage therapist Melanie appeared. Don’t love being massaged by a sick person but she insisted she was almost over it as she shook my hand with a painfully strong grip.  The massage rooms are spartan but functional and after we had agreed on a lighter pressure, the warm stone massage was quite good (although still hard pressure at times). Nice use of stones and hot towels.",
        "After my massage I had the express pedicure which said 45 mins but was more like 30. It was a choice between callus removal or cuticle work and I chose the former but really she could have done both in the time instead of cut it short. Seemed hygienic enough and she did a good job. At this point it was 1.15pm so I asked Bobbi about lunch menu and she said it was too late kitchen was closed?? I never saw anyone eating so wonder if they even do food anymore. I was hungry at this point and had planned to stay the afternoon but no food was a deal breaker. So I went home a bit disappointed."

Not sure what the negative reviews are about - the pool is huge and very nice, the infrared sauna, though small, was top quality and gave me an amazing sweat, the massage was wonderful.  AND you can order food from one of Toronto's top restaurants and have it delivered post-treatment.  Complimentary coffee, wine, and tea.  Beautiful, spacious change rooms.  Was having trouble adjusting to the TO cold and walking in here totally saved me!!"

        "I went because there was a last minute massage sale. The massage was pretty good. However the amenities are pathetic. A small, grim swimming pool, a hot tub and a tiny portable sauna. They also don't allow nudity so I was unable to go in the pool or hot tub (I did not have a bathing suit cause it was a last minute decision). To me that feels like body shaming, considering it is a women's only spa. Most of the space is taken up by couches and tables. They didn't even have tea. Definitely not worth the price. This is not a spa, it is a glorified condo recreation space. Save your shekels for some place better."

        "Extremely disappointed this spa is rated so highly. “Hydrotherapies” includes a pool, hot tub and sauna that fits 2 people. The sauna was not turned on when we got there at 11am and you’re also not able to go in it wet, which we realized after getting out of the hot tub. The facility is more of a lounge than a spa; 70% of the space is used for couches and chairs. My RMT, Celina Carroll was AMAZING. The best Swedish massage I’ve ever had. Tried to book four appointments online, but got the message “HTTP Error 404. The requested resource is not found.” Call to make the reservation over the phone and was surprised they had availability since all of the surrounding spas were fully booked. Found out they charge 18% gratuity for parties of 4 or more when we were paying. Absolutely outrageous considering you’re already paying 135+tax for an hour massage and NO WHERE else charges automatic gratuity. The receptionist tried to blame us for not knowing saying that the automatic gratuity is mentioned on the website – which it is NOT mentioned in the group-events section - all it says is there is a minimum of 4 for the booking and now I know why..."

Also the little things made the difference - the towel under my neck, the heating pad to ensure I didn't get cold, dry brush to start (usually it hurts but not this time).  Was definitely a treat!"

We also hung out by the pool and relaxed in the hot tub before moving on to our next destination. Overall it's a little pricy but the service was great and the amenities are very nice. I am thinking about coming back for a facial because I really enjoyed the atmosphere here. "

        "I went for a 90 min lava shell massage and was overall not very impressed with the spa. I have been to multiple spas before and was a bit dissapointed with the amenities available. The infrared spa was only turned on when I arrived meaning it was room temperature and only began to heat up when I was ready for my massage (I arrived an hour and a half prior to my appt). The pool was on the colder side as Well. The therapist was very nice but the massage felt disjointed. I have never had a lava shell massage so I don't know if it was just the massage but every few minutes there was a pause in the massage to switch in a new, warmer shell resulting in a massage that was not continuous for the entire length. Overall the massage was 7/10 but the amentities were 5/10."

EVERYONE loved their services! No complaints at all and some of us are avid spa-goers. ",

        "I am writing to comment on the fabulous agent who helped with my reservation. I used to be a regular at the Elmwood, but since then, the treatments and terminology have changed. I had read the online descriptions, but they are a little generalized. Carol took me through the contents of each body treatment and facial, and put together a package that sounds wonderful. It will be an important birthday for me, and with her assistance, I'm sure it will be more memorable. Thank you Carol for taking the time!!"

After a shower to remove hair products and lotions, we went to the third floor for water therapy.  Here there is enforced a whisper policy which was very nice - kept the serenity. Water therapy included a pool, hot tub (which unfortunately, the jets were not working) and Turkish sauna. Again cooling lemon water is provided, but bar service is also available if desired (at additional cost).",
        "After an hour of water therapy, it was time for our hot stone massage.  My therapist was Yu, my husband’s was Robert. What a wonderful experience. We were asked if there were any special concerns they needed to know about before starting and Yu checked on how I felt throughout the 80 minute massage. ",

My appetizer was chicken and shrimp skewers, my main course was pesto shrimp and pasta. Dessert was salted caramel cheesecake. Absolutely delicious!"

I got there and got a 20-minute massage  (I am surprised they were not willing to work with me and offer an alternative) because I was late and charged the total price of $211.31; now, had they given me a choice, I would have left, which would have been cheaper than wasting my time with that massage.  Afterward, they put you in the locker where you can get water therapy; at this point, I did not want to waste my time with the facial; everything seemed pointless and useless, so I left.  I would not recommend this place."

This was like a bonus massage in my schedule…. Except  3 days later I still hurt…. Enough to take Advil.  The massage was very deep and the therapist incorporated some uncomfortable arm stretches. Afterwards, thanks to the warm soothing pools I didn’t really feel bad until the next morning my neck felt puffy and bruised and my shoulder started to ache.  I get the impression that the therapists are on assembly line type of schedule…. Every 60 minutes a new stranger and they seem to have a regimental routine, not checking on patient comfort.   Overall, it was probably the most rough massage I have ever had.  If you have a high pain tolerance, beware.  On a positive note the water pools are wonderful…. They bumped the rating up one level.  Also, before writing this review, I emailed the spa but there has been no response.  I will not be returning as there are other options where I have had a more pleasant experience."

Received an email confirmation from Elmwood the next day and they had a link to their COVID protcols.  When I clicked on the link it was saying everything from the restaurant to the spa water therapies was closed.  So I called to cancel as I was planning a fun girls afternoon with my friend and I did not want to spend that much  money on just a facial.  Found out on the phone that the website info was not correct and that everything was opened but had to book the time which i did and then my friend as well.",
        "Got there checked in with the woman guarding the water therapies area and then we left for a bit and ordered a drink from the juice bar and then asked if we could drink it upstairs in that area (since there is seating there).  They said they would bring it up to us.  Woman who checked us in just 30 minutes or so earlier then behaved rudely to us like we were criminals trying to break in...then claimed that we already had our time for the water therapies and that we have to check in every time.  I asked her if I should sit outside on their front step in my robe since I have 30 minutes until my facial.  She then claimed she could make an exception but that we needed to understand that we can't just go in there.  My friend and I were embarrased and angry and how disrespectful she was to paying customers who were just trying to enjoy the drink they were PAYING for after paying 200 dollars for a facial.  So disgusted by her behaviour so asked to speak to the manager.",
        "Manager comes with an attitude does not introduce himself or tell us his name.  I try to explain that since the booking we have had a difficult experience (with incorrect COVID info and now rude staff), but he became fixated on the water therapies booking issue and the COVID rules that he claimed were up to date and then proceeded to ask us to show him proof but my friend pointed out that she is in a robe and her phone is in the locker.  I was so taken aback that he was not listening to what the real issue was (which was the way she treated us as we understand that there are rules but since I have not  been there since before COVID how would I know).  That I became angry that this guy's only objective was to tell us we were wrong.  I left for my facial and when I checkout out it  became clear that the staff at the front desk had been told that I was angry and the limited time I had in the water therapies (which again was not the issue) and then fixated on wanting to show me that their website is up to date and that I am wrong.  But now I had my phone so I showed her the email confirmation I received from THEM three days prior and she read it (twice checking the date as if I am lying), and then I clicked on the link to show her that it says every therapy is closed and that you  need to wear masks etc.  She also had to read that twice (even asking if she could take my phone from me to read it), and then she could not deny that i was RIGHT and that it was not up to date and that the only reason I found out about the therapies being opened was because I CALLED the next day.  ITs not my responsibility to navigate their site its theirs to be informing their clients properly.  I am attaching screen shots from this to prove my point..",
        "The sadder part was their was no real apology and just claiming that she was new and did not know about the other lounges we could sit in for our drink.  I asked for the managers name and the general manager and she did not give it to me.  No responsibility was taken for their wrong information and for trying to claim that I was wrong when I was right.  And no acknowledgement that the issue was how she treated us when Elmwood spa should be grateful for any business they get.  Especially since their spa has not been updated in years and their services are average - not bad but no cutting edge.  I will never go here again and wish I had never told my friend to join me since it was so bad.  Go to Body Blitz instead."

My first treatment was body scrub and massage. I came to the 3rd floor, but girl at the reception told me to go to the 2nd floor to the change room and leave my cloths in a locker. I came to the change room but receptionist there  sent me back saying that I will do it in the room. It's a winter time and I had to carry my coat and boots in my hands, I don't understand why she didn't allowed me to keep in the locker, I had pedicure after that. The body scrub and massage were fabulous! I had a bit of disappointment with the pedicure. The aesthetician was very nice, but the job she's done seems like a little unprofessional. My feet have not been actually cleaned properly, nails shaped unevenly and nails polish coating done awful. It was surprising as this place supposed have good professionals in the basic services too. Their massage therapy is great and the staff is very nice, but this left me a bit disappointed."

Night before our treatments got a call from Elmwood saying they had to cancel one of our treatments due to an employee travelling outside the country and now quarantining. Understood the rough circumstances and told them to cancel mine, making sure my wife still got the full experience. Woman on phone then offered me multiple substitutes only to announce they were all fully booked, something she should have checked before calling. Ultimately she said my treatment was definitely cancelled but they’d figure something out when we came the next morning. ",
        "Arrived the next morning and nothing was said about cancelled treatment, not even a refund until I brought it up, let alone a substitute. We were separated and rushed off to our first treatments where the aesthetician was incredibly rude to my wife. The only reason this review isn’t a 1 is because of how excellent my massage was. ",
        "After my massage, my masseuse recommended asking desk on third floor if there was any availability in pool/whirlpool/steam room. I did, they my told me to go to second floor. Second floor told me to to to front desk. Felt like I was just being passed off and shuffled along. ",
        "Rather than end up in lobby I decided to use steam room in locker room during what should have been a facial. My wife still had several treatments left in her day, usually accompanied by a large family party of 12 and several other couples (she asked why I was the only one who’d been cancelled when there were so many parties but nobody would tell her anything). After I left the steam room to head home, 3 employees (hall way attendant, juice bar, desk beside elevator) all told me I had to check out with front desk before leaving the building so I made sure to do that and get my refund.

They refused to serve her any drinks since our bill had already been closed when I checked out, as I was repeatedly instructed to do. The staff were rude to her, not offering any alternatives, just told she wasn’t allowed anything from juice bar except tap water. Will never be returning to elmwood spa, despite the wonderful massage, due to the terrible customer service."

        "I have been to this spa many times and have always walked away very happy. Obviously, prices have gone up everywhere, but Elmwood Spa's rates did not go up as much as St. Anne's (almost double now for the day spa). Honestly, I would not have booked my friends and I in unless I had heard about the 40th anniversary promotion of a complimentary lunch.  I have had their lunches on my birthday, also free of charge and I just love them.  I will say, they should include a cold or hot beverage to this offer just to make it complete. It goes a long way to offer even a coffee free of charge. Overall, my friends and I had a fabulous time.  I really enjoy the water therapies, the comfy robe, the slippers, the teas, cucumber water, etc.  My massage was excellent.  All the tension in my shoulders was gone.  Checking out took a while.  Only one attendant with 4 of us checking out. I will definitely return because it is a peaceful and relaxing environment, tucked away in the middle of the city.  Being in the city too, makes it easy to get to. We drove, but public transit is just fine especially when you can do a little shopping at the Eaton's centre or along Yonge St after this awesome day at the spa!"

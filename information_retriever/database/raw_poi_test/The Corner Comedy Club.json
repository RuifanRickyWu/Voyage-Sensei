This was a cute set up and had some really great comedians. I’d say I enjoyed 4/5 of the acts (some people just aren’t on their game 24/7) but over all I loved this spot. Keep it up "

Guys with no self-esteem who prefer to blame women and gay people for their problems rather than try empathy or self reflection. Then blame the crowd for not laughing.  Painful. Headliner was pretty good. Saved what was a mess."

They lacked originality and instead made awful raunchy jokes that were far from funny and instead just showcased their lack of intelligence. With even a little more talent they could have been able to make raunchy jokes funny, but instead they made insensitive jokes about topics they knew nothing about."

        "Enjoy the vibe in the east end. The bar could have a bit more options. Comedians are touch and go. Seen hilarious artists like Ernie Vicente and Sandra Battigliani. Comedians can also bomb HARD here and it’s such a small venue you can’t escape and it you want to die it gets so cringey and embarrassing. Dan Guiry has the worst melt down I’ve ever seen, didn’t seem to have a comedy set? Appeared too drunk to being doing stand up and when he didn’t get the laughs he wanted devolved into total anger towards audience and super banal predictable  sex/ race/ tropes. On a good night a great laugh on a bad night it can be very bad as it becomes SO AWKWARD when the comedian is visually melting down on stage in anxiety."

        "Small space, people sit way to close. I was there for a Sunday night show, didn't know boo-ing and heckling was the theme. I was planning on having drinks and enjoying good comedy. The comedians had no jokes or acts, they were targeting us and other audience to make up bullying-jokes. The rest of the audience were throwing hate speech at so many levels and grounds at the comedians. It felt like we were in a roast show, just throwing insults at anyone and everyone. You can tell when a comedian is making a joke vs using the stage to make hate speech. Never going back here! I have been to many other comedy clubs for cheaper or same price, and much better quality!"

        "While planning on what we wanted to do when we came to Toronto we came across this place and decided to give it a try. It's a very small little comedy club. Has a small bar, few choice for liquor and beer and took cash only. The comedy area had about 15 chairs lined up on each side of the walls with 6 tables in the middle that had two chairs in front of that. There were about 8 local comedians, some were good. Neat little place if you're looking for something to do. "

To  much information.  Thankfully  one comic  was actually funny  and entertaining. 10  minutes of enjoyment  and  1  hour  of  boredom  and rudeness.  My  wife and I wished we were  somewhere else."

Two of them were funny the other ones appeared to be high. As high as a cloud.  If you’re driving give yourself time for parking and read the posted signs. Some areas require permits. The entrance is on the side of the building. Drinks are pretty cheap. Two beers cost us less than $20CAD. They only have three types of beer which makes it easy to choose. Overall value was good. "

        "I can't believe the positive reviews here can possibly be real. It's a back alley door which could be cool I guess except you go into this windowless moldy smelling basement under some store. It's a long bar with a tiny space to walk through to get to the room which is like 12 seats and a stage in front of a window to the street. The comedians were the worst. We thought maybe the show it self was a joke the comedians were so bad. It cost something like $17 each to get in so not sure where these reviewers got $5 and $10 tickets but even then it is a rip off. Beers were like $10 each if you tip at all. Once you sit you are trapped because it is so small and tight you are rammed in like sardines. It felt like the host is also the owner and the comedians are all friends, like they put their money together to rent a club of their own because the real clubs won't put them on because they are just not funny. This show and club were a huge fail for us. The host was openly rude. Terrible management. Staff not rude but it is like they were not happy to be there and working for those people. Love the city and will visit again but not this club. It is like they are playing a game instead of actually trying to run a real club people might actually enjoy. Felt like everyone was disappointed and miserable which is extra terrible for a place that's supposed to be doing comedy."

It's $8 for a small bottle of beer as well which is insulting. The comedians themselves were good but with 10 minute sets you never get a chance to be invested in their act. As a result i can't remember any of their names. It just feels like a big rip off when the barmaid is also the waitress and ticket vendor. What am i paying for?"

It is a small club, but the atmosphere is friendly, personal and interactive which really adds to the experience. The bar is basic, but well priced and the bartenders are very attentive. Its worth it to get there about 20 minutes early as seating is first come first serve. Reservations are a must as this place regularly sells out especially on the weekends."

We had an absolutely brilliant night and laughed hard from start to finish. Highly recommended!!!!!! Drinks are also reasonably priced and they stock Magners which we Irish were very pleased about!

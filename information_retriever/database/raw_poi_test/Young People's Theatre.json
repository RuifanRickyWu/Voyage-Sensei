        "Don't get me wrong I'm open for new and modern but this play was either. I appreciate the actors effort they work hard and did the best they could with this play but who ever was the director of the play I have one question for you: Are you crazy? I took my 15 years old son to see the play he was learning Shakespeare last year and I thought it would be fun to see the play in an other point of view. This play had no point of view. When the actors where running around and around for 10 minutes and shouting I am Romeo, I am Juliet even though in the beginning they introduced them self with different names. It was confusing to hear a man saying I am Juliet. I just couldn't explain it to my son what does it means. Is he become gay or did he forget he suppose to be Romeo? The play was called What if ……. we didn't get the answer for this question. If you or your child haven't read Romeo & Juliet don't go to see the play it would very much confuse him or her. If he or she already read it don't go to see it because the original story is so beautiful don't mess with it. I think the theatre has to seriously consider to remove this play. All together it was awful!"

        "I recently took my family to the Young People’s Theatre presentation of “Beauty & the Beast” to kick off the holiday season and we truly loved it! This was our first visit to the lovely theatre in the St. Lawrence Market; what a wonderful venue to watch this production that kept us fully engaged with great musical numbers from the 25 year old classic as we sang along to all our favourites like “Be our Guest” and “Beauty & the Beast”. The costume and set design provided the prefect ambience for the talented ensemble cast of 14 that played over 50 characters. We appreciated that the YPT had kid friendly performance ties on Tuesday and Sunday with a great, interactive Q&A with some of the cast after the performance! We also loved how ethnically diverse the cast was, which is a tribute to the production management, the YPT and the talent of the actors. I definitely recommend “being the guest” of this production and I will surely be back soon!"

It was terrific,kept my kids attention for entire time 80 minutes no intermission I think that works well for young people. The singing. Acting were top noch professionals geared toward a young audience. I enjoyed it. We especially loved the live music, and singing. After the show cast members answered audience questions a nice touch. Our visit to the big city to see this play was well worth it! We will definitely be back!"

The cast was very talented with beautiful voices and lots of energy.  My nephew and most of the other children in the audience were riveted throughout the 80 minute performance.  I was able to get Super-Saver seats for $15 per ticket online and the parking right across the street from the theatre was reasonably priced and easily accessible. It was totally worth it. Highly recommended!"

I strong suggest you go.   The children could go up on  the stage after the performance and play with all the  balls, etc....  As true experience for  the very young  to expand  their minds"

It is wonderful to see my boys as excited as I used to be. We just watched The Studio (Oct 1, 2011) a wonderful contemporary dance production, my 3 year old was dancing around the living room afterwards. We are very excited about the upcoming Suessical- a musical based upon Dr Seuss books (Dr Seuss is huge in our house!).",

We have been going to all it's plays for the past four years and every year our children have simply loved the variety of dramatical plays and performances. Top notch acting. The price is simply nothing to see high quality performance. Save your money and do not go to any Ed Mirvish production and instead buy tickets to this local theatre. I purchase front row seats every year to all 8 of their performances and the total cost for four people to attend all 8 shows comes to the same total I paid recently for seeing the Wizard of Oz an Ed Mirvish production. In my point of view, you get much better value and better quality performances from LKTYP than any Ed Mirvish production."

        "We rented bicycles to go to the Toronto Islands. Bicycles were quite comfortable, pricing was good. Unfortunately one of the bikes had issues with the pedal gears (probably should have tested more when receiving the bikes). The bikes are comfortable but do look well used. Toronto city has good infrastructure for riding, despite road closures so you can even venture into the city for lunch in Kensington Market, for example, if you plan your route in advance to get through all the bicycle friendly roads."

        "The entire rental process, from arriving at the hiring outlet to returning our bikes later in the day, was slick and efficient. Helmets and baskets were included in the price. Locks were an extra $5. We asked for a full day rental, as it seemed our cheapest option. Our plan was to cycle the Toronto Islands as well as the Martin Goodman trail along the waterfront. The bikes were comfortable and well maintained. ",
        "We returned our bikes slightly earlier than expected and were pleasantly surprised with the way in which they calculated the cost per time. We ended up paying less than the full day hire fee. What a great business to deal with!"

Shop is perfectly placed next to the cycle path which is great for allowing you to get used to the bikes (and for us the switch in the side of the road). No companies offering bike rentals in winter on the islands so it was great to find this place near the ferry terminal. Islands give a great view of Toronto but without the bikes, and everything being shut for the winter season, we would have probably just got the ferry straight back. ",

Not only that, it allowed me the opportunity to explore the entirety of the island including parts that I had never seen before in 25 years of living in Toronto! Great experience all around - I will definitely be using the service again this summer :-)"

Although they didn't have bike suitable for our 6 years old, we rented a large family bike to carry the kids and it was also fun for them. Just need to be more careful when getting on and off the bike as it may fall. The pricing is quite reasonable for a shop in the city. We will definitely go there again if we are visiting TO in the future."

        "We wanted to rent some bikes to ride the waterfront trail downtown. I was going to rent the bikes through Bike Share Toronto, but from what I understand, you have to dock your bike every 30 minutes or risk a 1/2-hourly fee of $4 until you do this docking. I really didn't feel like having to keep track of this. Instead we found Wheel Excitement to rent a bike hourly or daily. The rates are great. The best thing is they had a variety of bikes, and the helmet is included with the rental. I recommend renting a bike through them vs. Bike Share. I plan on going back to Toronto and will rent a bike through Wheel Excitement again."

If you are not a bike share member, you can only use a credit card to pay for your rental, and the rental computer warns you a safety deposit of $250 \"may\" be charged to your account and can take up to ten days to be refunded to you, even if you return your bike within the agreed rental period. Fortunately I had enough money to spot the $100 deposit they charged me. I think it is ridiculous that this supposedly inexpensive leisure activity for locals and tourists can only be used by someone who can afford to have $250 go missing from his/her account for up to 10 days."

We cycled across the chain of 3 islands and caught the ferry back from Wards island..... much better than catching the ferry to Centre Island and hiring when we got there (the bike rental is not next to the ferry and there were longish queues at the rental place anyway).

We wanted a little more flexibility, in case we saw a store or restaurant in a random place that we may have wanted to stop in to.",

We were told that the shop closes at 5pm to return the bikes.  First we rode the bikes up Spadina to China Town for lunch.  Then we rode back down to the Toronto Islands Ferry Terminal, behind the Westin hotel on Queens Quay.  We rode our bikes on Toronto Islands for a couple of hours, which I highly recommend.  However, since it is Winter, the ferry does not run as often as Summer, and I realized at about 4:40pm that the next ferry at 5pm would not get us back to the shop before closing.  I called the shop at about 5:07pm as soon as the ferry landed back on the mainland, and fortunately someone picked up.  I high tailed it back to the shop and they were nice enough to allow us to return the bikes at about 5:15pm, which was past closing time.  We were extremely appreciative of this kind gesture.",

        "- they tell you you can start in any island, but the plan is actually very sequential and ideally starts at center island",
        "- the tasks where very subjective and not specific enough, for example there was a task to write what a certain statue is looking at. The statue can be seen looking at a boat, the city, the CN tower, or really anything in front of it. But there is only one right answer!",
        "- they try to incentivize you to not get a bike for “500 points” even though the bike rental is included in the price of the ticket ",
        "- the person who was running the show was really rude and socially inept. He went on this weird power trip ducking points away from teams for weird reasons (e.g. taking points away for not “listening” to him or making him repeat himself. Taking points away for being asked simple questions about the event.) when I challenged him on the arbitrary point system he snapped and accused me of “demeaning” the judges.",
        "- after we were done we were eager to get our scores and hear the results, but the organizer asked us to leave and said he would text us the score later. Kind of defeating the excitement and purpose of us being together for this event",
        "Great idea, terrible execution and shady business practices. Lookup other scavenger hunts on the island and take your money elsewhere!"

Eight of us booked Harbourfront Centre's sunset tour.  What a great evening!  2.5 hours of paddling, learning new skills, seeing the Islands and the waterfront from a new perspective, experiencing a harbour crossing, getting new information and history, and getting some exercise.  A much more interesting and instructive outing than I was expecting, and better equipment, too.  James was our delightful and enthusiastic guide."

Everything was well explained and as a total beginner I felt safe and well supported.  We kayaked over to the Toronto Islands, paddled around them, saw some amazing wildlife like turtles, Cormorants, Herons, and then came back to the mainland. I think that final stretch, with the Toronto skyline ahead of me and planes flying overhead, was one of the most amazing things I've ever done. And I've done a lot! I highly recommend this, worth every penny."

Cheryl explains everything in such a logical way that it was easy for me to understand.  Her best character is her ability to break down someone’s worry and fear and make them go away. Most people, including me, has fear of flipping over. In the beginning we got over that by her telling me what to do when that happens and explanation about how stable the kayak is. After that I could relax and really focus on learning the skills.  We learned quite a few things in our 3.5 hour session. I probably am not ready for a big trip yet, but I definitely got hooked. "

        "We had booked 2 nights in the Radissin Admiral Hotel  in Toronto and wanted to do something out of the norm whilst in the city. We spotted the Canoe Centre whist doing research on the. Hotel and it's location in the city. We popped our head in he office and was greeted by a young male behind the desk who was very police and friendly. He discussed all our options available, enquiring as to our previous experience in either a kayak or open Canoe. We chose to take the evening 3 hr excursion on a guided Kayak tour of the small islands and bird sanctuary in Toronto Harbour. We arrived in plenty of time and where we met our Irish tour guide who was very friendly. He assisted with kitting us out with a double canoe and and sizing our paddles correctly. We where joined by two other couples. After a short but sweet safety brief and a few pointers on how to paddle a kayak we headed out into the bay.  The weather had turned for the worse so the instructor offered us the opportunity to head back in and get a full refund which we all declined and continued on our voyage of discovery. Once across the bay we entered the Island Channels and began to explore. The instructor was very knowledgable about the area and gave us a full history lesson as we paddled pointing out points of interest and identifying the local wildlife. Again the weather looked like it was coming in so the instructor radioed to the main office for an up to date weather report taking in consideration for our general safety and also enjoyment. The weather wasn't as bad as first thought so we continued onward deeper into the inlets and waterways which all seemed very calm and peaceful apart from the odd boat wizzing past. We stayed out for over 2 hours which included a ' comfort break ' . We arrived back at the shore at dusk, unfortunately it was cloudy but on a sunny evening would have experienced a spectacular sunset over the city who's magnificent skyline was always in the distance whist we paddled but so much added to the experience.

After 20min paddling, we suddenly  stopped and were told we have an hour on Central Island now. We were both so much disappointed in that since we booked the trip for paddling only. We know the island just nor waterfront-wise. That actually has been a huge disappointment and has altered our excitment for canoeing. Especially, they haven't mentioned such a long stay on their website. ",

It's pretty exiting to cross over an expanse of lake to the Toronto Islands, there is lots of traffic and it might be intimidating to a beginner. I'm used to the Mississippi River, which is as wide in spots with bigger boats and a swift current to boot, so it was fun for me. Once you get to the islands, it's a quieter experience. It's great fun to explore around and if you like birds there are plenty. And you can't beat the views of the city from the islands, absolutely gorgeous. They give you a helpful waterproof map to take along so you can find your way around and even an out-of-towner can feel comfortable."

Nice trip out to the island and back. Power boaters were surprisingly respectful of keeping their distance, and reducing speed. You get such an amazing view of the city from the water.",

You see planes, sails, kayak, water taxis... the sky is always interesting and the cherry on the cake is walking on the islands with ducks and swans.  You feel at the same tome very far from the noise of the city and at the same time you appreciate th beauty of the buildings."

        "We had made reservations for the 2 person Tandem kayak which was noted on the website for individuals with no experience. Also on the website noted that we would have to pass a paddling assessment (this makes sense considering the harbour is a very busy channel). Upon arrival, reception and getting our life jackets and equipment went smoothly until we took our paddling assessment. ",
        "This was my friends first time kayaking so we had a rocky start in the assessment with the turning and maneuvering. After a couple tries, the man who was assessing us did not give us the green light to go out into the harbour. ",
        "We were totally understandable of this because we do not want our lives nor other peoples lives in danger and the man was simply doing his job. HOWEVER, the man who was assessing us was quite rude. He mocked us throughout the assessment, laughing and jeering at us as if he expected us to paddle like professionals. Not only was this embarrassing, he was very unprofessional. ",
        "It is one thing to do your job and it is another to harass your customers. We came here to have a good time and it was ruined for us. It's quite unfortunate and disappointing that we had this experience."

        "My friend was visiting from New York city and he is an outdoors enthusiast. We pre-booked the tandem kayaks 3 days in advance because they tend to book up fast in the summer. The price for 2 hrs on the water with views of the city and islands is hard to beat! The Kayak centre is very well organized and they help you into your kayak and provide life jackets and a basic explanation of the areas of the harbour to avoid. We paddled over to the islands in about 20 minutes and then explored the channels and smaller islands, including a place called \"Doughnut\" island because its hollow in the center and water filled. Saw lots of geese and even a rare Blue Heron. We took a short break on the islands and my friend had a swim! The water this time of year is warm. If you are careful you can take some photos from the kayak, just be careful not to drop your cell phone! A money belt is advisable, and swim suit because your clothes eventually get wet. This was a most memorable time on the water, and something you don't get to try everyday!"

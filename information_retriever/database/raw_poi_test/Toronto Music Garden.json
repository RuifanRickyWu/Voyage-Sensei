Starting off with the curves and bends of the riverscape, guests make their way through six sections of the garden ending at the Giant Grass Steps, which form a curved amphitheater where performances take place in the summer.",

Because if the hot sun we chose not to sit on the grass tiers overlooking the band, instead sitting on benches nearby in the shade.  It was still easy to hear the music.  We were expecting classical music as the ads said, so we're a bit disappointed to get South American pop music.  Nevertheless the whole experience was enjoyable.  After the music finished we wandered around the series of small gardens- for a couple of hours--what a delight.  The Music Garden is very easy to reach on public transit. "

  "description": "Etobicoke is a relaxed area along the Humber River. It's saturated with green spaces and conservatories, making it a premier destination for outdoor sports, hiking, and nature walks. Its abundance of parkland and lakes makes it a typical spot for fishing, picnicking, and camping out, especially in warmer months. The peaceful area is also enjoyed by families, who appreciate its boardwalks and sports facilities. Locals enjoy the variety of golfing and country club opportunities, which also provide lessons for golfers of any skill level.",

        "Humber Bay Park is separated into two parts by water. It’s a good place for kids to cycle and take photos, nearer Toronto’s iconic CN Tower than Jack Darling Park in Mississauga. Like a peninsula, there’s things to see on the East; but more available pay parking is on the West drive of Humber Bay. It’s adjacent to private Marina Del Ray (2261 Lakeshore Blvd West) and the Ukrainian Consulate. Photo opps are good on this quiet side; there’s more sand and nature scenes on the East park by the Air India memorial at the end of Park Lawn Road, where public washrooms in Starbucks and Tim Horton’s are open a short drive North above the Expressway exits. You’ll pass the Butterfly Habitat on foot by the West side of the park and long stretch /boardwalk in the direction of Humber Bay Arch Bridge (towards downtown). If you’re lucky you can snag a picnic table; but there are benches along the path. It would be a good idea to arrange a place to meet ahead with friends before beach volleyball season takes over. Or pack a blanket and sit anywhere to enjoy the view!"

The beach is built with big boulders which provides sitting space and watch the lake.  Geese and ducks were floating in the lake.  The most spectacular sight I caught is around 2:30 PM I saw thousands of birds (may be ducks) flying very low (their feet almost touching the water) in straight lines.  This view was breathtaking, it took almost 10 minutes for all the birds to fly.  I could imagine whether these birds started migrating already.  ",

It is the best place for a leisure stroll, to walk along the lake shore, as a couple, a family, or with your beloved dog.

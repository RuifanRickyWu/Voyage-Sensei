        "We went on the Obsession III sunset dinner cruise this past Saturday. It was a special birthday for my daughter so I purchased tickets and took her friends with us. They were all very excited, talked about it for weeks, got dressed up. They have never done anything like this. Turns out it was a huge disappointment and huge waste of money. Not at all worth what you will pay ($10 fee is added on to each ticket price, as well as tax). I have never left a negative review for anything, but this time I felt it was important to let people know not to waste their money. When I purchased the tickets, I requested to be seated at the window. This did not happen until I asked to be moved to the window. Then the dinner. I am not a foodie, neither is my daughter and friends. But honestly, it was the worst meal we have ever had. And it took three hours to finally get the main course! Like almost inedible food. There are no proper facilities on board to cook and plate the food so maybe this is why. We could see the food being plated from where we sat and I would be shocked if that area could pass a food safety inspection. When dessert was served, it was supposed to come with sparklers for the birthday but this did not happen. DJ and dancing is advertised, which was the biggest draw for us. But by the time the food was finally all served, there was only time to dance to one song. The music was shut down and we were back in the harbour by 10:00 pm, yet the Saturday cruises are supposed to go until 10:30 pm. The one and only good thing I will say is that the staff work incredibly hard. They are on their feet non-stop the entire cruise, serving food and drinks. They deserve to be paid well. Thank you for reading this. I could never recommend this cruise. If there were refunds allowed, I would absolutely ask for one."

Was a little difficult to get refills on drinks and dessert service was very long and one guest made a substitution request/inquiry but no one got back to them. One guest didn't receive a salad and another didn't receive dessert. Menu selection looked good, however prep was lacking. Chicken was a little dry, green/string beans were basic. Beef & sauce were \"just ok\" per guests, no one had the pasta, can't comment on it. Mixed drinks were fairly priced, however 2 guests didn't like how they were prepared and let them sit. Jackson Triggs for wine. View/skyline was very nice at sunset. Despite the above, no one complained, which is what made the evening most enjoyable, the company. Had expected a better dining experience for the price."

        "We took the evening sunset cruise version on the Obsession III  which included dinner. You can purchase wine (bottles) in advance when you book your tickets, but there is no advantage to doing this. The wine on the menu is readily available and the price is the same. The booking will tell you to get there 30 minutes in advance, and you should arrive at least that early. There was a big line up when we arrived, and the on-boarding moved slowly-they take a photo of each couple or party as the board to try and sell it to you later. There is upper and lower floor seating and it is first come first served-you can‚Äôt reserve. Don‚Äôt be disappointed by about not getting the seat you thought you wanted. You can easily walk out to a viewing deck while you are waiting for dinner, and once you are finished, you can go out on deck again and admire the view all you want. In fact, my preference turned out to be the bottom floor where I was seated, because they leave that floor alone, but the top floor, they clear after dinner, and move the tables to the sides for guests to enjoy the music and dancing available if they want. The dinner was fine, nothing worth raving about. The views are amazing-the Toronto",

The vegetables were a can of corn with a few baby carrots thrown in. So bad. We ate first and it was cold so the people upstairs on the boat definitely got really cold food. The route the boat takes was nice. Nice view of Toronto. We had to go eat somewhere after the trip. No ice. We ordered a 5 bucket of beer which did not come in a bucket. The beers went warm. I do not recommend this brunch to anyone. Not good."

        "The crew wasnt very organized. No announcement was made about when the buffet was being served. When we finally got in line, most of the food ran out including pastries and fruit. The server just threw the food on our plates and they all looked as though they didn't want to be there. The coffee and tea were not included and we were charged $2.50 per coffee. Rather disappointing as the meal was mediocre for what we paid. Only redeeming quality about this afternoon were the great views we saw of the Toronto skyline. Highly recommend you save your money and use it for a cruise - only trip around the harbour on one of the other company cruise ships for $25 and enjoy just the views and go to an AYCE buffet somewhere else in the city."

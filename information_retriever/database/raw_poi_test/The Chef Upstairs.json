Lots of couples were there but no issue being there in your own. Thanks for a fun time."

My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed the previous classes, and it was even that much better without the need to do it via Zoom.  (Top marks the Chef Julian and the team though, they made the pivot to online classes last year like it was second nature.  They were an excellent experience as well!)",

With patient and professional guidance the meal the class created was truly restaurant-quality affair.  All the dishes were flavourful and plentiful, with all the ingredients complimenting their dishes perfectly.  We learned that even what we would consider the most unlikely of ingredient pairings can come together in delicious ways.  For instance, beets with a chicken dish.",

The setup encourages fun interaction to make a truly memorable evening.  Sipping wine while cooking together makes it truly fun",

The main course of tomato based risotto with seafood (mussels, shrimp, trout, calamari) just did not hit the mark.  The sauce was bland and the chef chose to place the seafood on the risotto at the end as opposed to simmering in the sauce- as a result flavour was lost",

The chef and host gave scanty explanations of the dishes, the ingredients and the cooking methods (although they did answer questions very knowledgably). They would have been better equipped to do so if another person had been on hand to pour wine and wash utensils -- which occupied a good deal of these guys' time. Also, there are some marked differences between the food we prepared and the printed recipes that we took home. One real gripe: The email confirmation on the morning of the class included a blunt reminder to tip the host and chef. This is not a restaurant: Upstairs Chef should pay their employees enough so they do not have to rely on tips."

We began with the basics like how to hold the knife properly to have the best control over what you’re doing. This was news to me, apparently I've been holding the handle too far back for years. No one was sent off to do a new task without support and guidance from the Chef. I’m actually glad we were placed on the soup team because we got to see our dish through to the end and learned tips on plating as well! ",

Before the cooking begins, Chef goes over the menu, ingredients we’ll be using and demonstrates useful techniques. Then we’re divided up into teams to work on the various courses at the same time. Chef does an incredible job guiding a large group through the activity while empowering you to take initiative and make the recipe your own.",

I learned a lot of useful skills that I’ve already starting implementing in my own kitchen. It was a fresh take on recipes I was familiar with and since I usually lean towards a sweater flavour profile when I cook, it was nice to experience savoury recipes I can use to switch things up at home. Chef Pierre was a great instructor! I was amazed by his multitasking skills and uncanny ability to seemingly be able to be exactly where he was needed at any given time."

        "My friend and I had a great evening making a French-inspired meal. The kitchen was very nice and completely prepped and ready for when we arrived.  My only note is that it is not as interactive as I had believed it would be. We still got to take part in the cooking but everyone only got a chance to cook 1 maybe 2 things. For example, we just got to chop and cook the onions for the french onion soup. Since everything was happening all at once it was hard to know what other people were making. We did get a recipe at the end though so we could make it ourselves.",
        "From my research, this was slightly cheaper than some of the other similar experiences in Toronto and I really thought it is worth the money."

        "The people are nice but this is not an experience you should ever consider signing up for.",
        "It's basically an overpriced cooking demonstration followed by eating the most mediocre food I've ever been served at this price point.",
        "Here is what I expected. Each person or couple would get like their own burner and ingredients and would do all the prep and such and learn each dish. The reality is the chef doing most of the work beforehand followed by parceling out assignments that just insure that all you get is a sliver of the dish. i.e. if I am chopping onions, I am missing everything about how the meat gets cooked or how something else is being prepared.",
        "So, you'll learn nothing. ",
        "That leaves the food...which is terrible...I've been to Thailand six times...this was the least authentic Thai food I've ever seen...and badly prepared...the meat was rock hard and way overcooked (searing meat does not take 8 minutes! My lord the meat was like old shoe leather), the rice was undercooked, everything was served lukewarm, the Pad Thai looked nothing like any I've ever eaten.",
        "Here's the thing...a cooking demo where people \"help\" could be fun at $50 if they were honest about what it was. Charging $112 (with tax) per person (plus drinks) is just setting your money on fire.",
        "Do yourself a favor, watch some youtube videos and go eat 3 meals at a real Thai restaurant. You'll pay the same price, enjoy it more and not have to spend three hours chopping garlic."

        "We did this as a corporate social event at work and it was so much fun and very informative.  The cheese board prior to the cooking class was delicious.  My favorite was the goat cheese with cherries - so tasty!  The class itself was great.  The chef gave us great tips and kept everything flowing well.  We made minestrone soup, ricotta-stuffed tortellini with mushrooms, prosciutto and peas in a cream sauce and deconstructed tiramisu.  Making the pasta was fun. The food was delicious and we had a wonderful time.I would highly recommend this place!"

        "My partner and I had been wanting to take a cooking class for so long, and our experience at The Chef Upstairs did not disappoint. After receiving a pasta maker for Christmas, we decided to sign up for the Italian summer pasta making class to try our hand at making homemade orecchiette. Chef Elise and David were attentive, personable and made the overall experience a very enjoyable one. As the only vegetarian in our group of 14 couples and friends, I was worried about being excluded from the overall experience. Rather, I was accommodated throughout the cooking process and encouraged to experiment and add my own flavours, herbs, cooking method/approach etc to each meal I helped to create. I really appreciated this. The length of the cooking class is perfect - 3 hours was more than enough time to mingle with others in our group, create 3 incredibly delicious meals, connect with my partner and enjoy a cocktail and glass of wine while listening to some fabulous music. The great part of this process is you can be as involved as you want. Some of us (myself included) rolled up our sleeves and got right in there, while others were happy to try their hand at a few recipes or just sit back and just watch everything unfold from the comfort of their seat. We were thoroughly impressed with our experience and are already talking about taking another class in the future with family and friends!"

        "What an utterly amazing trip this was! the falls, well themself are just beautiful. The photos do not tell what it really looks like. It was beautiful. We were in a smaller group which ended up being kind of nice, so we can whip through the sites even faster. The boat is not ready, so we did the falls walking behind. It was nice, but a bit damp. I guess better than the boat!!! The trip is long as there is traffic coming into the city, but the real highlight was the guide. She was the sweetest lady, and really knew her stuff. This overall was a great trip to Niagara Falls, not sure what else we could have done to make it better"

Our guide David, totally bi-lingual (of course he was...) smoothly switched back and forth between French and English, but also explained everything in Spanish too, for a family on the boat.  He was knowledgeable, amusing, and told us many detail about the area which other guides had not told us on different tours.  It wasn't a \"must do\" event but it was definitely enjoyable."

        "It was my first time visiting Toronto and I had a great time. The booking says they were offering hotel pick up at select locations. Make sure if you do not know where you are going because you may be new to Toronto to book a hotel from what's listed. Unfortunately I did not and got a little lost meeting up. Make sure you leave a little early just in case. The driver was a little late but understandable due to heavy traffic. What I did not really care for was being rushed from the tour guide when we already started off late when we got to Niagara Falls. There were some parts where the tour guide was helpful and nice but other where he seemed a little frustrated because we were taking too long. He didnt really guide us too much anywhere you spent most of the time exploring by yourself and meeting up somewhere that changed a couple times. I wish there could have been more time to explore Niagara Falls and definitely more time at the wine tour. There wasnt really an actual \"wine tour\" just some flights of wine that's very sweet like juice with extra sugar. If you like dryer wines I would definitely not recommend this tour because they are showcasing the ice wines which are extremely sweet. I am okay with some sweet wines but these wines are not for drinking the whole bottle but popular in Canada due to the temperature for ice wine. I also would not reccomend buying lunch but finding it on your own. Also do not explore the lower falls it was a waste of money to look at it. There is really nothing to really see. The attractions were really cool I went on the sky wheel which was fun to experience, you get to go around 4 times and see the falls in the air. The rainforest cafe was really cool also and there is an open bar there. I got to experience a couple attractions, ate lunch, and had a cocktail, and took some pictures but there wasnt enough time. I met some nice people while on the tour also."

There were 7 of us in the party and he catered to everyone’s needs - even down to small details like making sure the seating arrangements were rotated so I wasn’t in the very back of the car we drove in as I’m tall and it didn’t have much leg room! ",
        "The whole day was just timed really well and there wasn’t any point where the stop of times felt like they dragged. The day went by very quick and we actually packed in a lot of things such as wine tasting, lunch, Niagara on lake with time to look in all the stores and the Niagara boat tour. I didn’t expect to go on the boat tour and did find this a bit confusing on the information provided - the boat operates into the end of November and only after that is the behind the falls substituted. ",
        "My only criticism would be that I emailed in advance to ask to be picked up from our hotel but it wasn’t on the list of hotels they pick up at, so we had a short 10 minute walk to a designated pick up location and then had to go pick up some other guests who stayed in hotels with pick ups available - one of which was literally the hotel next to where we were staying at. I would’ve appreciated being picked up to save time and hassle wandering around a new city. ",

Also Viator/tripadvisor don't  tell you which company is runnig the trip, so we nearly missed the bus because it said VIP on it and we thought it was going to be something called Niagara Falls Tour or similar. And it takes ages to go round all the hotel pick-ups; is it too much to expect everyone to get to a single central location? On the plus side the guide was good, and the Falls are spectacular."

Second, If you’re travelling in April to Niagara Falls I would suggest putting off the tour because you can’t go on the boat cruise and take nice pictures because of the frozen ice on the water.  (That’s the reason why I chose this tour because it was included) You’re probably better off renting a car, driving there and taking your time walking around and enjoying the city of Niagara. It’s a beautiful city with lots of sights, and shops to visit. It’s a better option than having only 1.5 hours to see the Falls and then having to go because you’re on a time restraint to go to other places."

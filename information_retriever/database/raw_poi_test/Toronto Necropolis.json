The cemetery itself is a peaceful place, so long as you don't get too close to the eastern end, whether noise from the DVP can be intrusive. I liked the monument raised to the memory of Samuel Lount and Peter Matthews, executed after the 1837 uprising, and Jack Layton's grave stone."

Located across the road from the riverdale zoo and in Torontos cabbage town neighbourhood the Necropolis cemetery  offers a chance to look back at some of the history of Toronto. From politicians, doctors, to families of the early war years many grave stones date back to the 1800's.for those that enjoy photography the old and worn headstones offer some great chances to to capture unusual elements of the old stone work, for those that enjoy 3D work on a computer the old grave stones provide great textures and shapes to work with. The cemetery is mostly well kept and is a nice quiet setting on a summer afternoon"

Well maintained, it is very welcoming and filled with history.  Strolling through the park-like setting, you stop to read inscriptions of many years gone by with words of love and loss.  If you find yourself in the Cabbage Town area of Toronto (a quiet neighborhood of beautiful old homes), take a few minutes to enjoy the solitude offered by the Necropolis."

        "A necropolis is a large ancient cemetery with elaborate tomb stones. Toronto Necropolis is not that large and the tomb stones are not anything crazy. Mount pleasant cemetery is definitely larger with all kinds of tomb stones, monuments and mausoleums and a better choice if you want to see elaborate grave sites. On the other hand, the unique thing about this cemetery is the old tomb stones and the well known political figures, such as Jack Layton, buried there. The engraving on a good number of stones was worn down and you could not read what was written on them. The oldest burial site that I spotted was from 1854. A nice small church/funeral chamber is also located at the entrance of the cemetery."

It's a pleasant, peaceful walk while imagining the lives of inhabitants here and a great place to reflect on life. Unfortunately due to snow, ice and tree debris I found myself almost walking over headstones and broken bits of memorials which I found a bit sad. If you need a lift afterwards, head to nearby Riverdale Farm where its lively animals will put a smile on your face!",

Because this is our oldest cemetary I had thought that it would be much more preserved and graves cleaned up.  Having been to cemetaries in other Countries I was saddened that this looked so neglected.  With Mt Pleasant there were people walking and looking all around.  I was the only person in there.  A map pointing out predominant areas would have been great.  I only had a paper I cut out of a book and it too did not give much information.  The history of the people in there would have been both helpful and interesting.  Remember they just put Jack in there"

        "St James Cemetery dates back to Toronto's early days and looks it, holding many of Toronto's early and prominent citizens. Oddly juxtaposed across the street from a soviet-style 60s housing project, it stands in stark contrast to the modern era and is linked more to Cabbagetown to the south. All of the Victorian Toronto would've been bulldozed if the modernists had their way. The other (and larger) Mt Pleasant Cemetery may be better for running and cycling but the St James necropolis is a more authentic gothic graveyard experience and ranks up there with Paris, Havana and Glasgow in my opinion.

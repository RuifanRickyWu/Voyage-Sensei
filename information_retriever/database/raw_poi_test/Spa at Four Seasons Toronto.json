        "The massage experience was unparalleled compared to any other spa. The massage therapist ensured I was completely relaxed and comfortable throughout the session. However, the pool area did not meet the usual high standards expected of a Four Seasons property; there were chairs cluttered with used towels and no guests utilizing them. We had to request drinks from the front desk since there was no server on deck. Apart from the pool area, everything else was exceptional. The changing rooms were well-equipped with everything you could possibly need. I would enthusiastically recommend the Four Seasons Spa for any occasion."

        "Had a lovely time and enjoyed our massage and facials up until the end of our visit. My mother was looking at a serum and put it back when the lady who was helping her walked away. When she came back, she looked at the shelf and then at my mother in shock, hastily looking for the serum on the shelf, asking my mother where she put it and if she could 'take it off of her hands for her', insinuating that she thought she still had it on her, when her hands were visibly empty. She had put it back in the wrong spot, and when the lady realized, she literally sighed of relief. We didn't realize that when you book the treatment and put your card information, they don't charge you automatically. The spa day was supposed to be a gift from my sister and I, and we didn't want our mother to know how much everything costed for that reason, so we left a note and specified them not to tell her, but the lady handed my mother the bill and gave her the bill breakdown still, even though we had left a note and specified that it was a gift and not to do that. My mother knew this was supposed to be a gift, so was a little taken back when they handed her the bill for that reason, and the same lady read into it that we couldn't afford to pay, and started asking questions insinuating that, such as 'is that okay?',  'we can split the payment if you need'. Overall, the services and amenities were great, but the profiling and behaviour from certain staff was a bit uncalled for."

        "Towering over the vibrant Yorkville neighbourhood, the design-centric Four Seasons Hotel offers a melange of luxurious amenities enveloped in a sophisticated architectural setting. Accommodations are gorgeous, authentic French food authored by Chef Daniel Boulud is served, the hotel offers convenient access to designer shopping , museums, restaurants, all that Toronto has to offer.....and to relax the body, mind and soul after a hectic shopping spree...there is the Spa.",
        "Ah....the Spa ...the Four Seasons Spa which features an indoor swimming pool, comfy lounge chairs,  whirlpool, sauna room, relaxation room,  massive spectacular change rooms and a high-tech gym with an adjoining yoga studio so I can do my 'sun salutation'......there is just a ton of wellness amenities here. The facility maintains the swanky demeanour of the hotel proper with it's lavish luxe aura and yet promotes an overall soothing ambience with its neutral tones. This vast wellness 'farm' weighs in at 30,000 sq. ft. (you can't feel claustrophobic here) embraces 16 treatment rooms including a luxury couples suite and a salon with hair, manicure, and pedicure stations. The roster of treatments is exhaustive with seemingly every imaginable kind of ritual available.....as with some fruity exotic treatments like the Ruby Red Grapefruit Scrub....sounds like breakfast to me. Being a spa novice, I choose my go-to treatment in the form of a massage......great stuff as I emerged from the session in a cloud-like state ready for life anew.",

        "Boy were we disappointed. There was NO water/tea/snack station anywhere!!! I understand they don’t want people touching water dispenser during covid, but at least leave water bottles around. I like to stay hydrated and was perched the whole time. The outdoor temperature this day was 30 feeling like 40 so we wanted to cool off in the pool but it was freezing! I was shivering for 5 minutes when I got out. The balcony seating area was noisy there was construction right above on the 10th floor, not relaxing we couldn’t lounge around like that for more than 5mins. They offered food orders off a QR menu. You have to pay for water! (Side note, we were shopping at Holt and they even had complimentary Flow water battle stations around the store and you don’t have to buy anything)!",
        "Massage was $259.90 tax included per/person. ",
        "Massage was the only thing I enjoyed, sheets were really nice, and bed was comfortable because it was adjustable. I still feel that it was a rip off because spa experience was not worth it. I’d break it down that massage was $159.90, and use of shower was $100 lol. They even have the nerve to ask for tip.",

        "True to brand, this property has sumptuous rooms, great service, and decent food offering. Love their attention to personal needs especially for repeat guests. For woman traveling alone I have to say, the ground floor lobby bar has a shady crowd. I popped in for a quick dinner at check in. There was a huge scuffle with an unwanted guest that went out of control with yelling and hand cuffing. A man sitting next to me that I was barely civil to asked me if he could join me in my room....very creepy this never happened to me before. Sadly this bar seems to be drawing a certain type of characters. Would go back to this Four Seasons but avoid the bar all together and stick to second floor restaurants."

        "We spent time in the hot tub and swimming pool on our first day as we arrived at the hotel very early needless to say the room was not ready. There seemed to be several people there for the same reason. After a 14 hour flight we found this extremely refreshing. The area was clean and well maintained. The pool side menu is very limited tho. They do offer a larger menu, food ordered off this had to be eaten outside on the terrace. I understand the reasoning for this it does make sense but on a windy day it was not an inviting thought at all! ",
        "I did spend an afternoon in the spa. I had a wonderful time. The environment was spa perfect! The air conditioning was set at  the perfect temperature unlike so many spas that are way too Cold! The treatment was wonderful. The products used for a facial Smell good and really do make your skin glow! I did find it a bit of a rabbit Warren tho. There are no signs pointing you in the right direction on any of the doors - and there are many doors!. I had to ask an attendant how to get back to the locker area, I also got lost looking for the the shower!! "

        "I opted for a 60 minute Aromatherapy Massage followed by a 3-in-1 super Facial with Collagen Mask. I went early in the morning and it was pretty empty when I arrived. The lady at the reception kindly offered to take my coat, and I was introduced to this lovely spa attendant (whose name I cannot recall, but she was so sweet!) who showed me around the facility. Since I pretty much arrived when they first opened in the morning, I did not have time to use the hotel pool and hot tub BEFORE my session. I spent some time in the waiting room lounging on their curved chairs drinking tea before my massage. ",
        "Although the massage itself was relaxing, I wish more pressure could have been applied on my back. It seemed like the masseuse was just making long strokes along my back rather than applying pressure, and even though I asked for more pressure halfway through I didn’t feel particularly loosened up after the massage. The masseuse however, was extremely sweet and very accommodating to my music requests (I did ask her to change the music a few times)!",
        "My facial was wonderful and my face was glowing after! The effect lasted days after, and I didn’t experience any breakouts or eczema, which is such a bonus because of my sensitive skin that often reacts when it gets in contact with incompatible products. If I were to choose between a massage and a facial here, I would pick a facial hands-down!",
        "The spa has a co-ed lounging area with huge white sofas and where they offer water and magazines. By the time I was finished with my massage and facial, there was a lot of customers around. I wish it was a little quieter in there since there were some ladies chatting. Halfway through my spa experience, the same spa attendant from earlier came by to ask how everything was going for me. Talk about some 5-star service!",
        "I also took a dip in their pool and hot tub. Their hot tub was soooo relaxing I stayed in there for QUITE a while, not giving a single care in the world that I was beginning to turn into a prune. I still felt sticky from the massage oils and went to take a shower in their beautiful shower room. Like any high end hotel spa, they use high-end skincare products and offer clean combs for each customer. ",
        "Overall, the facilities were clean and the staff were attentive. The facial was great, but the massage service was mediocre at best. The other thing I have to point out is the reception lady answering the phone who seemed a little bit rude when I called to make my appointment. There was also another time where I had to cancel an appointment made for someone else, and the reception lady interrupted me WHILE I was talking. For a spa located in a world-renowned hotel and with their price point, they should really be more aware of the little details. I really wouldn’t mind their prices IF their service was on par; however, I felt slightly underwhelmed. The spa is supposed to be a relaxing space from beginning to end, and the Spa at Four Seasons MOSTLY achieved that. Minus 1 star for the receptionist lady and minus 0.5 stars for the massage.",
        "Would I come again? Probably not. Although I would certainly like to try out their scrubs or body wraps, there are other wonderful spas in Toronto that I have yet to experience (with professional receptionists and better massages) at a similar or better price point.",

The spa at the Four Seasons is the closest I can get to the European spa experience whenever I'm in Toronto.",

So many people complain about the cookies -- if you don't want them, just don't eat them?!?! I think it's ridiculous that some reviewers are basing their ratings with the \"white flour\" cookies as a major drawback of the spa. It's a minute detail that does not matter. The actual spa and spa experience makes up for this and goes well beyond in terms of attending to the minute details in all other categories.",

The staff, attendants, and service providers have always ensured my comfort throughout my spa sessions. I really appreciate the sauna to use after (or between) services. I also LOVE the fact that the spa attendants don't EVER harass you to leave or anything like that. I like going to the spa alone for some \"me\" time and I don't really like talking to anyone in the process. And I never really have to. I've found peace and serenity at the Four Seasons Spa Toronto, and for this reason I will keep on coming back."

The attention to detail during your treatment is extraordinary and the facilities are calm, clean and simply a pleasure to enjoy. It is a bit of a splurge but it’s well worth it. Do not hesitate to try this spa and even save it for a special occasion as you will not be disappointed! Enjoy! "

        "This was my first time to the Spa Four Seasons. I was there with my husband and 2 adult children. The facilities are absolutely beautiful. Very clean and high quality. I had a great massage. The therapist really listened to my requests. It is a great location to visit with members of your own gender as the relaxation lounges and the steam rooms are found within the change rooms. There is shared space in the gorgeous pool area that has an amazing hot tub though."

        "I will preface my review by saying that the spa itself is beautiful, and what you would expect from a Four Seasons product. I was disappointed, however, on several occasions during my visit. The ladies at the front reception were kind and warm, as was the lady who escorted me to meet my massage therapist after showing me the facilities. This is where my experience began to sour. My therapist was very passive aggressive, and upon meeting me said, in a very curt manner, “you didn’t answer me when I said your name so I didn’t know if you were (insert my name here)”. I was pretty appalled by this, as we were the only ones in the area and the lady who gave the tour was escorting me directly to the therapist. Additionally, I never once heard her say my name so when she came back with the snarky comment of “you didn’t answer me” I was pretty taken aback. Okay, whatever, moving on. We go into the room and the massage starts. All is well. Until sirens start blaring. The room was not sound proof and every passing emergency vehicle could be heard along with car horns. Not what I expect from such an esteemed brand. Obviously they can’t control what’s going on outside but I would have hoped for more sound proofing. My friend and I used the pools and hot tub after our massages. Warning - the pool is shared with hotel guests and there were many children jumping and splashing about (it was Christmas, so probably busier than usual. I have kids so it didn’t both me but it may have interfered with other guests relaxation time). The final straw was when we went to pay for our massages. We asked for receipts for insurance purposes (we had specified this weeks prior when the massages were booked). my Friend and I were both given a receipt with the same massage therapists name -  and neither of us had this therapist do our massage! We took this to mean that our therapists were not registered and thus would not be covered by insurance. This seemed fishy and shady to us and left us feeling as though the spa was being somewhat fraudulent with their dealings. Again, totally not what I expected from a 5-star facility. If I could I would give 3.5 stars, but since I can’t, 3 will do as I do not find the experience worthy of 4 stars. "

Upon arrival, we were greeted immediately and shown to our respective change rooms. The massages were amazing, as well as all of the facilities. The only downside is that the only co-ed area is the pool. Regardless of that, it was such an amazing experience and would highly recommend going during the week as it was not busy."

The entire booking process was seamless and the customer service from the spa reception team was awesome.  We were able to book all of our treatments around the same time block and discretely pre-pay with gratuities our services for my family.",
        "I booked the Aromatherapy massage, which was the second time receiving this service at this spa.  It did not disappoint - both times I have had wonderful RMT's, unfortunately I cannot remember of the name of the gentleman from the first appointment.  Yesterday my RMT was Josef, who provided amazing service.  I mentioned at the beginning of the treatment that I was getting over bronchitis and he was kind enough to get me a glass of water in case it was needed during the service.  Before you start the treatment you get to choose between four different essential oils related to the four seasons for your massage.  I chose autumn which was a mix of mint, rosemary and vanilla essential oils (smells amazing).  The massage was amazing and I felt a million times better afterwards.  You can really tell that their staff care about providing 5 star service in all aspects.",
        "The facilities itself are also beautiful, warm and welcoming.  We used the steam room post-massage and it is a proper steam room.  I have been to other spas where the doors never were quite sealed right or the correct temperature.  The relaxation room is comfortable and stocked with teas and some small bites.  The lockers were also super tidy and the staff maintaining them were super helpful, friendly.",
        "I have only had a massage here, but would like to return for some of their other services.  My sister and aunt had the elements facial, which they both loved - their skin looked amazing too.  ",

I was then taken to the change room.   It had been awhile since my last visit, so I was given a tour.  The locker attendant was so nice.  Once I had my locker, I slipped into the luxurious robe.  It was like wearing a cloud.  I had the LTB facial.  I loved the facial.  I left feeling refreshed and looking dewy (thanks so much Victoria)! ",

Nice and clean with lockers, sofa area, tea, water and snack area (with vegan treats...yay!), washrooms, showers, make up counters, steam room, and a lounge area with reclined “beds” to wait for your treatment.

My only suggestion is there should be an “occupied” sign at the showers when in use. It was fairly easy to tell the glass door showers were in use, but not so for the curtained shower.",

        "After my massage, Julia greeted me for a thorough facial. I was happy that I had been booked in with her as she does a great job with extractions and always has my skin glowing at the end of the visit. ",
        "I'm looking forward to my next visit. I would recommend taking a day off work to go on the weekday when it's much quieter. I'll definitely be booking with both these ladies. ",
        "I do wish you could order lunch to eat by the pool instead of having to get dressed and head down to one of the restaurants. ",
        "Also, there was some confusion at the end of my visit about the method of payment. My partner had pre-paid for the visit, however the lady checking me out assured me this wasn't the case and I had to present my credit card. While I was downstairs having lunch, my partner called in and they found the already paid for gift card on file that he had purchased in advance. I had told them this and this is the second time this has happened. It's a bit of a stressful event to have happen at the end of a relaxing visit. Obviously, this wasn't a one of situation since this has been twice in a row now. I then had to go back upstairs after I spoke with him to ensure I had been refunded. They knew I was down at the D Bar so it would have been a nice touch for them to send the message down that I didn't need to head back up to see if this had been rectified."

        "I work for a small business and our company took us for the Elemental Massage and Element Facial. The waiting room was nice. The massage therapist was very professional. She explained the massage we had booked was different than a typical massage and I could switch if I wanted. I appreciated her intro description as the massage was certainly different but I quite enjoyed it. I think her explanation in advance really helped me be more relaxed. The oil and scent was one of the nicest I have had for a massage, so great!",
        "The facial was very lovely and left my skin feeling fresh. Overall it was a lovely and professional experience. The spa pool is one of the nicest spa pools I have seen for a toronto spa, or in door spa! It is nicely integrated with couches and outdoor seating. Beats the pool at Toronto’s Ritz!!! ",
        "A few cons: ",
        "-when I entered I asked the doorman how to get to the spa. He said 9th floor guest elevator but didn’t elaborate.  I tried to take the first elevator I saw and turns out wasn’t the right one. I’m normally not this picky but would have expected a better flow and service at four seasons",
        "-robes- too heavy for summer and too small (I’m a medium and felt too small like I was going to expose myself)",
        "-snacks (a couple options which were tasty but below par, the Ritz has much better snacks and in fact massage tables)",
        "Overall it was a lovely experience!  That said, in my view, you really need to use the facilities and enjoy the steam room, pool etc to make the cost worth it. If you just want a facial or massage without the experience it is not worth the cost in my view!!!!"

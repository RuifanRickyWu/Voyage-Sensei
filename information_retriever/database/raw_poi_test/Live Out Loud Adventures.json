        "This trek is a REAL adventure and for me, was a decidedly POSITIVE experience",
        "So many unpredictable elements... the weather, one's ability to physiologically adapt to the environment, the capacity of fellow trekkers, safety of the terrain, need to rely on the expertise of the local teams with limitations to communication....",
        "The planning for this adventure began 18 months prior to our trip.",
        "Alison coached us through the prep both in terms of equipment and physical fitness. She acquired the permits and tickets, set up accommodations, chose restaurants and selected the support team for the trek itself making it nearly effortless and more importantly stress free for those of us participating.",
        "We acclimated in Cusco enjoying the local cuisine, touring historic sites and Inca Ruins, shopping and learning about Peru and its people.",
        "Then came the trek... to which there is a very personal journey independent of the group dynamic.",
        "The scenery is awe inspiring, steep mountain slopes rising up from lush valleys, Lamas, sheep, cattle and horses roaming freely, wild orchids, hummingbirds, crops growing on terraces, salt evaporation ponds, snow capped Andean peaks, pack horses ( mules) and porters...",
        "We hiked for 6-8 hours a day without a dull moment.",
        "Alison fostered a positive social environment acting as a liaison with the locals.",
        "Alison encouraged us, ensured our safety as much as is possible and celebrated our daily accomplishments with us.",
        "The trip exceeded my expectations in many ways!",
        "LOLA gets a strong recommendation from me!!!"

The cycling was challenging, as expected, the accommodation, food, scenery and even the weather was superb. This is the best of small group touring: brilliantly executed trips with a specific focus, in relative comfort with like-minded people. Very highly recommended. "

        "This was the first of I hope many trips with Live Out Loud Adventures. We went on the Patagonia (Chile) trip - so much fun, and remarkable in many ways. Alison curates the trip personally; working so hard sourcing flights, hotels (2 of the most stunning we have ever stayed in!), tour guides, restaurants, novel experiences... She brings together like-minded fun, smart people, with a spirit of adventure, appreciation of fine things, and wonderful humour - we see each other regularly! Alison is absolutely brilliant in her ability to pull together a magical trip!"

        "I have completed 2 trips with LOLA:  Kilimanjaro and the West Coast Trail.  Both experiences were absolutely extraordinary!  Everything from the trip planning to the actual treks was first class.  John and Alison, our leaders for Kilimanjaro were excellent, as was the crew who joined us from Moshi on the climb.  It was an amazing experience and one I will never forget.  Our LOLA guides, Teri and Graham for the West Coast Trail were also excellent.  Again, meticulous planning and flawless delivery of the trip.  I have booked and am looking forward to my next trip with LOLA - the Fisherman's Trail!  I would highly recommend this organization."

I highly recommend LOLA and am so grateful for all the excellent experiences I have had with them."

        "LOLA is a company that provides a superbly organized adventurous travel experience with a heart. I had the pleasure of summiting  Mt. Kilimanjaro followed by a Tanzanian sarfari (2014) and a vigorous exploration of Chilean Patagonia (2016) with the LOLA team.  Prior to both trips I was given detailed, user friendly and enormously helpful information regarding packing tips, travel documents, trip itinerary and any medical/immunization requirements that made preparation a breeze.  Other than booking flights, essentially everything else was looked after by the LOLA team.  I think the only time I took out my wallet was for a personal item or a one time collection for pooled gratuities that was respectfully and generously distributed by the LOLA team.  Alison and Angus lead the Mt Kili trip and Alison travelled with us to Chile.  The choice of local guides in each country was fantastic.  Alison and Angus are very experienced with outstanding outdoor education skills.  The daily tips - climbing techniques, packing, local culture, hydration/nutrition....- were essential for our best experience.  Health and safety is a top priority, but so was fun, laughter, pushing physical limits and sharing our goals for the experience.  The fundraising for, and time spent with, the children at the Amani Home in Moshi Tanzania made the experience even more enriching and rewarding.  A trip with LOLA will offer you a very challenging physical experience with a hearty “eat, drink and be merry” atmosphere.  Do yourself a favour and book a trip with LOLA.  You are guaranteed a superb adventure."

        "The decsion to climb Kilimanjaro with my daughter was a quick one, the harder one was deciding how to do it.  A chance encounter with Scott Kress who had climbed Mount Everest with Angus put us in touch with LOLA and the stars aligned for an amazing experience. Alison was so helpful and understanding of our fears and uncertainty, (mostly mine). She planned our exercise regime and Angus was the go to guy for all equipment knowledge.  We felt very prepared for the trip. Once in Tanzania and on the mountain we felt so secure in Angus's experience and leadership.  The team they assembled to help us up were also outstanding. Some of us experienced some minor altitude issues but Angus sorted us all out and the entire team minus 1 made it to the summit.  Time spent on Kilimanjaro will remain with me forever not only because I accomplished it with my daughter but it was a kick start to a more balance life with regards to exercise and knowing that I have the ability within me to accomplish things that seemed out of reach. For that I will always be grateful for my daughter for talking me into the trip and for LOLA for helping me accomplish it.",
        "Overall I was so impressed with LOLA  that I had no hestitaion in booking a 2nd trip with them to Patagonia and I will definetly be travellling with them again in the future. ",

        "Thanks to Alison and the gang at LOLA, I will also remember the pure joy of running into my Mum's arms at the summit of Kilimanjaro, both of us sobbing and laughing in utter disbelief that we achieved our goal together.  After setting the goal of climbing Mt. Kilimanjaro upon graduating high school and somehow convincing my mum to join, we chose Live Out Loud Adventures to help make this crazy mother-daughter dream a reality. The trip was so well organized from the beginning- Alison and Angus ensured that we were as prepared as possible and helped calm any fears. The rest of the group were great travel companions and we bonded quickly on the trail and over shared meals in the dining tent. Angus and the Chagga tour guides went above and beyond to ensure our comfort and success. We were briefed on what to expect each day and they checked-in with us frequently to make sure we were doing okay. I highly recommend travelling with LOLA, Alison will make your wildest travelling dreams come true!"

        "Wow - what a great trip. We went on a 12 day hike in the Alps in July of 2017. This was my wife's third trip with LOLA but my first with the company. I would definitely go again and recommend this to anyone interested in hiking. What makes these trips so great is the well thought out management of both the big and small things - very professional. They provided great preparation materials in advance of the trip so no surprises. The date that was selected worked very well with the conditions, the route selected was just the right length to enjoy the vistas without being too onerous. On our trip we had a rest day in Italy at a fantastic hotel after about 3 or 4 days of hiking. This break day gave everyone a chance to sleep in for a day, do some sightseeing in town, and to adjust their backpacks for things needed and or not. The accommodations were climbing huts in the mountains but the term 'hut' will give you the wrong impression. They are more like a hostel and all based on serving hikers in the mountains. Comfy beds, sometimes private - sometimes communal rooms, hearty breakfasts, hike, packed lunches, hike, communal dinners with a glass of beer, in bed by 9pm - repeat. All well organised, friendly guides, and tons of fun. I would go again on either this trip or others planned by LOLA."

        "This was a chance to see someplace that we thought we would never visit, and to experience it in a way that was just so different than anything we had done before. Firstly, the landscape is unlike anyplace we have been and I have been to many beautiful spots. Alison had arranged the perfect mix of very interesting hotels at night, with long, gorgeous hikes that were sometimes tiring, but always worth every second of it. We are pretty close to sixty but the group was a mix of ages and everyone had an amazing time together. The meals were a real highlight as well, as we recounted the days adventures to each other. I have recommended this trip to many other people, some who have now made the trip as well. Now we are off to do the West Highland Way with Alison this May and we are so looking forward to it!"

Out accommodations in Patagonia at the Singular and the Explora hotels were elegant first class, making our arrivals after a day of hiking welcoming and pampering. The daily activities included hiking over the most beautiful terrain, boat rides to hiking destinations or to a sheep farm with horseback riding, and some climbing--but not too onerous. She puts together small groups who all share the desire to work hard and relax hard. We're looking forward to our next  Live out Loud experience with Alison."

  "description": "Since 1993, Meridian Arts Centre (formerly the Toronto Centre for the Arts) has welcomed thousands of visitors, patrons, performers and artists through its grand main entrance. The Centre began and remains as unique and diverse as the Toronto community itself, a testament to the virtues of harmony, vitality and celebration, with a spirit that embraces innovation and tradition equally. Located in the heart of the Greater Toronto Area, no other entertainment and arts facility is better positioned than the Toronto Centre for the Arts. It is easily accessible by major highways, arteries as well as the public transit system. Equidistant between the Sheppard and North York Centre TTC stations, the Centre's surrounding area boasts ample on-street and underground parking, and convenient special needs parking near the theatre entrance.",

        "Saw the show Mughal e Azam at this centre. I am sure it was a great show, but could not appreciate from my faraway, $200 seat. Our seats were too far from the stage. The theatre was half empty, the front of the house was mostly empty. Could not see actor’s faces or could not make out which actor on stage was speaking. Could not distinguish between actors of the same sex. It was too distant, like watching a big TV screen.  The theatre was too large for the show and the tickets were totally mis-priced. ",
        "While I understand this was not a drama but a musical  but could not stop comparing Prithviraj’s Akbar with his deep, baritone voice and verve to this Akbar - failed to get me involved with the drama or the spectacle of the set design or the kathak dancing.   Sometimes it felt there too few extras filling the large stage. Thrust stage layout could have helped with getting the audience involved - I am sure the actors did not like it as they were not able to establish a rapport or intimacy with the distant audience. ",
        "Not worth it unless you’re sitting in the first 30 or so rows."

        "I’ve never been disappointed at Toronto Centre for the Arts. My friend and I went to watch Mark Leiren-Young’s “Bar Mitzvah Boy”—an amazing two hander, ably stage-managed by Seren Brooke Lannon. I appreciated the meaningful and engaging interaction in Greenwin Theatre; it was incredible acting by Hannah Miller and Ralph Small, who carried the show to the end. I liked the show and space or the intimate atmosphere inside Greenwin. (If you’d be uncomfortable in the narrow hallway, then the bigger theatre inside this Centre for the Arts would provide a suitable alternative.) I would recommend Harold Green for theatre-goers from (or visiting) Toronto... Avery Saltzman has had 40 solid years in the industry and did a great job as Director. The North York setting is ideal, as the Toronto Centre for the Arts is centrally located just North of Sheppard on Yonge, near Highway 401. There was plenty of parking at 5000 Yonge underground (facing Toronto Centre) and also behind the Centre for the Arts, adjacent to Beecroft street. The closest subway station would be North York /Civic Centre, just above Sheppard station on the Yonge-TTC line. We found seats at the bar under the spiral stairs, prior to locating our seats inside Greenwin. You can expect to enter about twenty minutes before showtime."

I’ve seen performances in two of its stages, being the 1,036-seat George Weston Recital Hall and 576-seat Lyric Theatre.  The other two are the 296-seat Greenwin Theatre and 200-seat Studio Theatre. The theatre is nice, well-maintained, clean, not overly big, good acoustics, and the seats are comfortable, fairly roomy, and provide good legroom. With the grade and instructions given that no one should stand during performances, I believe the view is good from all seats. At this last performance, I had a seat 118 in row “O” and found the view to be very good. For maybe 45 seconds, a young buy stood on his seat and blocked my view, but the lady beside him (likely his mother) got him the sit-down. Since the young boy was under four feet in height, likely he had little to no view, but that is understandable and would be the case in the vast majority of theatres. ",

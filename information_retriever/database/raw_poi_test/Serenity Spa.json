  "description": "Situated astride Lake Ontario, Scarborough is a district heavily influenced by immigration. With a number of low-rent shopping and dining options making it a highly affordable part of town, and boasting one of Toronto's largest shopping malls, the otherwise green suburban neighborhood is a good place to go for bargains and discounts. It also draws in photographers. The spires, archways, and cavernous rooms of the BAPS Shri Swaminarayan Mandir Palace are filled with breathtaking art, architecture, and detailed reliefs – it’s like entering a different world, The ruins of columns and installation art at the Guild Inn makes a free-for-all exploration site, while the big-name draw for young photographers is the menagerie at the Toronto Zoo. While many visitors shirk Scarborough as too suburban, its houses are some of Toronto's most mystical and haunting architectural beauties. And for adventure lovers, it has river-rafting and some unique hiking trails.",

        "I bought a mani/pedi massage and facial on a Groupon and was so dissapointed. I had been to Serenity the year before and really enjoyed my experience so I was looking forward to returning. The place has definitely gone down hill. When I first arrived the young lady who did my massage and facial gave me a pair of house slippers to put on. They were dirty and the sole was falling off. I showed her the slippers and told they had seen better days, her response was \"oh we have been meaning to go through them\" but never offerred me another pair. The massage was terrible and the facial was just a mask with some steam and that was it is was all over. My manicurist was pleasant however the quality of product didn't last even two days before chipping and peeling off. I opted out of a pedicure and just wanted her to clean up my toe nails from wearing polish all summer long however when she was done they still had a yellow tinge to them and didn't not look any different. I will not waste my time or money again on this place."

        "The ladies working at this spa could care less about customer service.  I asked to speak to the manager and she didn't care that I found the floors to be dirty and didn't find the place relaxing or the employees to be rude (texting, talking amongst themselves outside my message room).  There was a lot of construction around the spa.  You could hear it inside when you are getting your mani/pedi.  I thought the spa was affiliated with the Radisson.  I don't think it is.  They are located beside the Radisson.  It wasn't worth the visit or the price."

        "Just finished a great facial with Sherone at the Serenity spa conveniently located beside the Radisson Harbourfront hotel on Queens Quay. It was my 5th visit there since we moved to Marina 4 November 2015. I've had their Harbourfront package special twice including a shellac mani/pedi, massage and facial, and bought it as a gift for friends this holiday. As a gal living on a sailboat in Toronto Harbour, it's a pleasure to find the gems of kind, high-quality service with affordable rates for health and wellness care, right at home. You can indicate if you'd like them to relax and take time to get into a zen mode, or if you've got a busy evening ahead and would appreciate a quicker, thorough, effective service. The products are  top notch, as a person who has sensitive skin, the spa staff know what's in their product, and they use a facial analysis scanning technology to decide what kind of facial is best for you that day. After a dry indoor holiday week away, I'm ready to go back to work after my brightening and clearing service with expert extractions. I'd recommend this business, especially alongside the fact that they've survived the extended construction on Queens Quay with a small, dedicated and satisfied clientele."

        "I bought a Groupon for a one-hour massage and a Life in the Metro mani and pedi for both me and my new husband, as a way to relax during the week we took off of work after our wedding. It was unfortunately not a great experience. First, I had called about parking, and was not given clear instructions now was I told that it would cost $25 to park in the hotel - she led me to believe it would be free. The place was not so clean or relaxing, and it had full-wall windows on street level which was disconcerting as people could see us. I had told them this was part of our honeymoon, and no one said anything. I had my massage in a room that was meant for couple's massages, and it was very squished. The masseuse did not introduce herself and was very unprofessional. She left the lights on quite brightly, did not ask me what I wanted to focus on, and WAS TEXTING WHILE SHE MASSAGED ME. Seriously. She ended abruptly and it was not a full hour. The mani-pedis were only all right and very quick, and it was odd that we were looking at a construction site and pedestrians. I was unimpressed and disappointed."

        "I came across a Groupon deal for this spa that consisted of a 30 minute manicure, 30 minute pedicure, 30 minute non-RMT relaxation massage and 30 minute facial all for $80.  I thought this was a great deal and decided to check it out.  Now, I've been to this spa before many years ago, but don't remember my experience.  After visiting this spa again, I remembered why I haven't been back and will never go back.  If it wasn't for this incredible deal, I wouldn't have gone there in the first place.  ",
        "I like the finer things in life, however I'm far from posh, just a little picky.  I work very hard for my money and want to treat myself every now and then with splurges to the spa, but I\"m willing to pay for it. This place wasn't worth it, not even for $80. ",
        "The spa is very small and not even located inside the Radisson hotel which it is affiliated with.  There is a lot of construction in the area and driving through it gave me a headache, which is not the way I wanted to start my relaxing start spa treatments.  I had to sign a consent form on their tablet which I found to be non-responsive, slow and dirty.  They should clean it after every use as it was covered in fingerprints.  Although it looked clean, the spa was very rundown and looked old-fashioned.",
        "Sonia, my esthetician, was amazing.  She deserves to work in a better facility.  She gave me the best non-rmt relaxation massage I've received in a long time.  I was actually relaxed at the end of it.  She is personable and down-to-earth.",
        "This place is not what I expected.  If I was a poor university or college student making minimum wage and wanted to get the most bang for my buck, this is where I would go for spa treatments.  They shouldn't call themselves a spa.  They are trying too hard to come across as an upscale spa.  It's not.  Please give this place a miss.  It's not worth it, deal or no deal."

        "Amazing spa, wonderful staff, and a fantastic experience overall. I was gifted a travelzoo promo to this spa last year and now am a repeat customer and can swear by it . The owner is so sweet  and you can tell she  prides her business, though the estheticians are not the same who serviced me on my very first visit which has not turned out to be a bad thing since their quality of service has improved for the very best! I thoroughly enjoy their massage and facials and enjoy coming back every time.",

        "I did not have the pleasure of staying in the hotel but I love Toronto and the view looked abvolutely amazing with tons of things to do in the area. This review is for the spa. I received a package  for a manicure, pedicure, facial and massage. ",
        " ",
        "Lets just say the manicurist dropped a full, bright pink bottle of polish  all over the ground. Needless to say, the polish got all over my legs and my freshly done pedicure, but also on my pants and sweater. I sat there in shock as she wiped my legs down with acetone. She turned the fans on for my hands as she started to clean the floor, but I was preoccupied with getting the polish out of my clothes. I gave her the benefit of the doubt and waited for an apology or something to try to make it right… but nothing happened. I asked her and her colleague if they knew how to get nail polish out of clothing, and they responded with ‘I’m sure you can just Google it’ and ‘At least it matches your pants’ (because I was wearing patterned tights – and no, they did not match because I was not wearing bright pink!). I was in shock by this response (or lack thereof!) that I was getting, so I said I was not going to finish my treatment so I could go home and try to fix my clothing before the nail polish sat for too long. When I was asked if I would like to come back another time, I said no (especially because my commute was terrible and I took a full day off work for this) and asked to speak with the manager. I was told she was not in and there was likely nothing they could do since I got the certificate online. Again, no apology was given for this – instead, the colleague said ‘just give her Seema’s card and she can figure it out herself’. Wow. So I gave the manager’s business card to my boyfriend who has still been unable to be in touch with this poor excuse for a manager. I even said to the girl I understand accidents happen but her response could have been a lot better, especially being in the service industry. If I could give no stars I would. Absolutely do NOT waste your money on this place."

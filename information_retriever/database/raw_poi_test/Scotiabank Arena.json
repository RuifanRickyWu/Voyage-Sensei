It was disappointing that the $12 collector cup from last years (lack of) playoff run did not come with a refill.  The crowded concourses were also frustrating to maneuver around.  When you have a lack of merchandise tables available, you are missing a half hour at least of time to watch the show.  That’s really unacceptable.  Weezer’s Journey to the Blue Planet salvaged the experience, it made the night special despite the shortcomings of the under construction SBA!"

I know comedians are always trying out jokes and refining them... but don't tell me that's what you're doing--own them! Then there was this constant dialogue with the Gervais haters. and I don't keep up with all that crap, so why subject me to this dialogue, don't waste my 90 min show time with that.

Even 100 level seats can be somewhat tight and uncomfortable if you are a taller and/or larger person.  Beware if they only have a few seats on sale in a section.  It means that the promoter and/or Scotiabank are going to upgrade people who paid way less than you did for your tickets and you won't be happy.  This is true especially if those upgraded stand up in front of you and block your view.  I don't find Scotiabank to be a comfortable venue.  Plus, the concessions are overpriced....like almost $8.00 for a pop.  "

        "So this is the epicenter of pro hockey, the arena was odd lets just say.  There are only two big decks so you would think the concourses would be wide, not the case, you are really crammed in there.  I did get a foot long hot dog and a nice blend of peppers was available at the condiment bar so that was good.  Beer prices are what they are at pro venues so there is no point in complaining about that.  We sat in the upper deck under an overhang of luxury suites that hang down from the roof which didnt hamper our view of the ice but it made it so you couldnt sit there and see the whole arena, also the sections are wide so there will be up to 30 seats in a row.  This place is OK but for it being the arena for THE team in Canada it was kind of a disappointment.  On a positive note it is literally connected to the downtown commuter, long distance and  subway trains station so you dont even need to drive there, the GO train in from Oakville took about 40 mins."

Firstly, if you’re going to the game, don’t enter in the long line on Bremner Blvd, head into the side entrance on the left and the inside line goes through security much quicker. After we headed inside we checked out the team store. There is nobody there for crowd control so it is wall to wall people so that you can’t comfortably shop or move around freely. Decent selection of items though and pretty standard fare. There is a store directly across the street from Scotiabank that offered more items at a discount, and even all other teams items as well.

It was worth the 50 min walk across town on our recent visit to Toronto."

The biblio-matic is really fun as well. It’s $3 per person, you can only do it once (a day, I believe) and you get a randomized book. If you love books, I highly recommend stopping by here and picking something up!"

        "When planning our trip to Toronto I stumbled across the Monkey's Paw and it's Biblio-Matic vending machine.  I know this was a must-stop place for me since I am a bibliophile and could spend hours in libraries and book stores.  The new location was not too far from our hotel and was easy to find.  The store did not disappoint, it is small but well-appointed with lots of shelves with books as well as some beautiful plates from books that were unsalvageable.  I spent less time than I would have perusing the books because my husband was with me and it's not really his thing (although he did find a book he liked), but despite not taking as long I did find a couple of great books myself and had a chance to talk to the owner for a bit.  Of course, we had to buy a token to try the Biblio-Matic, the book it chose for us was Diseases of Fish, which was perfect, my husband loves fishing and he was thrilled at the selection.  If you enjoy books this is a stop that should be at the top of the list if you visit Toronto."

We also picked up one or two books that we liked for very reasonable prices. ",

        "The Monkey’s Paw bookstore is, simply put, fantastic. It is both extraordinary and imaginative. When you walk through these doors, you immediately feel as if you’ve been whisked off into some Kafkaesque dream – highly appropriate given the name of this unique shop. You won’t find your Danielle Steeles, your Dan Browns, your Stephen Kings or even your Margaret Atwoods here. Oh no! That’s because the Monkey’s Paw doesn’t sell traditional literature; in fact, the owner won’t even buy anything published before 1980. The focus here, in keeping with the “Monkey’s Paw” theme, is on the uncommon, the bizarre and the esoteric.",
        "At the back of the shop, you will undoubtedly spy the world’s first – and so far only – Biblio-Mat. The Biblio-Mat is a homemade random automatic book dispenser that will release a unique tome for a mere $2. It is probably the biggest draw, having been profiled in major articles and newspapers like the CBC, BBC, National Post and the Wall Street Journal. In fact, it was through a recent article on Global that my partner and I first became aware of the Monkey’s Paw. Our intention was just to visit, utilize the Biblio-Mat, quickly browse the book selection and then leave; however, we got pulled in and ended up spending over $100 on some unique and old books over and above what we got from the Biblio-Mat.",

The Biblio-Mat was designed and constructed for the Monkey's Paw by animator Craig Small.",

        "There was this guy who came back from a trip to India with a monkey's paw (because he was in the service, possibly- bear with me, I am just getting warmed up here). He tells this small family (a husband, wife and their grown son) the story of the monkey's paw, which was that the paw has the ability to grant three wishes, but the last person who made three wishes used their third wish to ask for death. Big stuff. The guy who came from India tried to destroy the monkey's paw dramatically while telling the story, but the husband he was telling the story to saved it and used it to wish for money. Not a ton of money, just enough to pay off his house. Then, (this is the first gross part) the son is killed by machinery in his company. Coincidentally (actually the opposite of coincidentally- this is all because of THE PAW), his family is compensated the exact amount of money his father asked the monkey's paw for to pay off their house. Ewwwww. THEN, the wife uses the monkey's paw to revive her son (although he has been dead AWHILE now) and there is a knock on the door. The husband (who made the first terrible wish and the second to bring back his dead son because his wife asked him to) makes a third wish for his son to go away before the wife can answer the door. So messed up. Seriously, stop messing with fate.",
        "Man, I should write book reports professionally and only about stories I haven't read in 15 years. Solid career choice.",
        "ANYWAY, is it a place where you could spend hours walking around? Probably not. It is a relatively small store and, where the texts are interesting, the store is a little more resistant to that type of lolly-gagging than most other books stores I have been in. But here (following The Monkey's Paw theme), your wishes are books that you can straight pay for (using \"loonies\" and \"toonies\"- Canadian money is hilarious) instead of having to lose a loved one. Just saying.",
        "In closing, a series of questions and answers that really could be written as statements, but aren't because it is more fun and theatrical to write this way:",
        "Are there medical drawings on the wall? Yes.",

        "Did I buy a copy of a Calvino and a Neruda? Duh, of course.",

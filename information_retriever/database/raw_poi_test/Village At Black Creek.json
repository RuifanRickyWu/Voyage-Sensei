        "Used my TPL card to get here for free with my family. Even if I had to pay I wouldn't have regretted it. The staff at the entrance immediately give you a map and explain what and where you can do. The village is big and it took us around 2 hours to walk around and see everything. You can enter houses and see how people lived, how their rooms looked like. Some rooms were blocked from entering but you still could look inside. I really liked the atmosphere. I'm a city person but sometimes you have to leave the noise and bustle behind to enjoy nature. I also liked the animals. We saw sheeps, geese, and horses. There were also pigs but we couldn't find them. There were people but they weren't  annoying. A lot of entertainment for kids. There is a lot of space to sit and relax or eat. The food is expensivebut what did you expect. It is cool that once people actually lived in this village and it is all real - not replica. I left this place with good memories and will definitely recommend it to my friends."

        "i just went on the haunted ghost walk with two of my other friends, it was an out of body experience. at first, i was laughing, joking, and scaring my friends (who are of lighter heart than me) but things quickly took a turn. when we entered the house titled \"the second house\", our guide told us about a 17 year old boy named michael who died in a hunting accident (the son of the owners of the house) took a specific liking teenagers. when he was done telling us about the history, he told us to turn our flashlights off and began asking michael to give us a sign of his presence. he then asked if any of the teenagers were willing to get michael to give us a response. i was the only one willing, but i regret it now. i confidently said \"michael, i'm a teenage girl, please give me a chance!\" this caused everyone to laugh, but it was also accompanied by a subtle but very clear knock from upstairs. i was the first to leave the house. as if this wasn't enough, when we entered \"the manse\" there was very clear rustling near the staircase. i was standing right beside it. it was dark and pouring rain outside, creating a creepy atmosphere. i also swear i saw a glimpse of a man in a beige suit standing and listening attentively to the tour guide in one of the closed off doors in \"the burrow house.\" nobody believes me and my dad gave me a lecture in the car about how the supernatural doesn't exist and that everything is set up prior to our arrival. i beg to differ. please, go on the ghost walk. you won't regret it."

        "I am reviewing their Ghost Walk specifically. Myself, my husband and another couple attended one of their Ghost Walks on October 22nd 2022 and left feeling very disappointed. Our reasons: ",
        "- It was a rushed tour to the point where when given \"a couple minutes to look around\" is literally a couple minutes so you do not get to see the entire space in many of the buildings. Especially when the tour group is large. There were many buildings we went into and only saw a fraction of it because of how rushed the tour was. We actually heard another tour guide speak to our guide and say \"Sorry I am going as quickly as possible!\" When their tour was still in a building we were waiting to get into. ",
        "- Many of the ghost stories included certain buildings or rooms within the building but we were unable to go see those rooms or that building. Full upper levels blocked off yet the ghost story was about that floor? Just don't share that story then. ",
        "- The tour seemed very rehearsed and not authentic. A part of these tours is how good your guide is. They just came across like a bad actor that had other places to be. No magic was created by their story telling. ",
        "- Ticket of tour DOES NOT cover parking. After a disappointing tour we were greeted with a $10.50 parking fee for being there for 75 minutes. This was the nail in the coffin for us,",
        "- The tours are booked basically back to back so throughout our tour you could hear other tour guides which affected the overall feeling of our tour. Some guides voices echoed throughout the grounds above our own guides voice.",
        "- There was a scavenger hunt going on at the same time and these groups had big bright lanterns. Between all the people, the bright lights and the chatter, there really was nothing spooky about it. The ambiance was stolen- and it felt like it was because they were trying to book as many things as possible for profit, forgetting that this would negatively affect the experience for the patrons.",
        "- During the tour the guide was telling us about other dates and saying we should come back, selling us on other tours they offer with Toronto. This was so frustrating because it was during our tour time we paid for. There were other times this information could have been shared, like walking back to the main building AFTER the tour was over. Not while we're walking through the village hoping for a spooky experience. ",
        "Overall this was a very disappointing, unauthentic experience. It felt like a cash grab, Myself and my friends are big fans of these ghost walks, however after last night we will never be back and will be sure to let others know about our experience. ",
        "There are many ways to make improvements to this tour, however the main focus is going to need to shift from capitalizing on how much money you can make in a night and more on the overall customer experience. ",
        "Big thumbs down. I wouldn't pay more than $10 a person for what we got."

The only real verisimilitude breaker was the planes over head and the roadway sounds nearby, neither of which were under their control.  The Christmas lights didn't add to the creepiness, either.  Definitely coming back."

        "Ghost Tours expecting it to be a spooky experience for Halloween. But it was just about ghost stories and paranormal activities being narrated. Casandra’s narration was amazing but along with the narration we were expecting that something would happen inside. But we’re disappointed as there was nothing. Not worth spending $30 per head for the Ghost Tours. ",
        "However you can take the tour of the village during the daytime and it would be worth the money spent."

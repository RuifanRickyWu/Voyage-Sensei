Our guide, Kenny, was so personable and entertaining, and walked us through the history of the company and the brewing process for their great tasting beer.  You get a cold Steam Whistle beer for your tour, and I recommend coming a little earlier and having an 'unfiltered' pint to taste the difference.  The tour really gave us a better appreciation of this true Canadian brand, and I highly recommend stopping in to say hi, have a pint and take a tour of the brewery in their historic home."

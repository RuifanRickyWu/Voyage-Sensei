It has a real vintage feel to it, not like the cookie cutter big chain ones at all. A lot more character. The bathrooms were very clean, and the staff friendly. The smaller theater was much more intimate than the huge, boomingly loud chain ones. The ticket prices were also much lower than most theaters. I highly recommend this charming little movie house."

        "So much of down town Toronto is changing dramatically enough with the construction of big towers for condo living excitement for me for me to notice during my recent visit there and for me to discuss now for this review that I prepare with pleasure to share with the many readers who benefit from reading the opinions of outsiders who visit a commercial cinema in Toronto. Carlton Street is one of the few streets which gain its identity and name merely because College street ends at Younge and Carlton Street begins there to create a theater district for movies. That fact is interesting for me to note. So many of films shown at the Carlton are not always my type of film, but I pay attention to what is being presented there. But I also pay attention to the never ending exploitation of movie goers with food and drinks. I wonder often about the wisdom of young and old people who are now deciding to buy into this expensive business of accepting a slice of the current trendy life in urban entertainment district as their place to live. Do they know what they are getting themselves into?  Many of the films are popular in part because they get publicity and are presented as fashionable pieces of clothing. But they are shown and served with food and drink when the movie goers should be permitted to see the film a second time without being pulled into accepting poor culinary eating habits just to put junk food in their stomach. I have seen one or two films there as a small taste of urban entertainment life just to see what is it like to see a film in a foreign country at a commercial cinema. My principal complaint against this old time method of seeing a film at commercial cinema goes like this. I do not want refills on popcorn or drinks or whatever food is available for consumption at the cinema. At no cost I want a refill on the opportunity of seeing the film more than once if I like it that much. What about seeing the film a second time at reduced cost? Keep the food and drinks and give me a chance to see a film at no extra cost twice or three times and discuss it long after I see it as well as after the first showing of the film I attend. Commercial showings of good films that I want to see again operate in the wrong way. Provide the names of people who want to discuss the film so they can get together at another place. Give them a chance to begin their discussion after seeing it for the first time at the commercial cinema. Develop a wide network of film aficionados and let them branch out to bring in fellow film goers to their their club but begin everything at the first showing of the film at the commercial cinema. Security is a big problem for these arrangements to unfold just to see a film again and to develop a network from the experience of seeing a film twice or more often film - to form a group composed of fans who might want to see a film a second time I admit. Allow the cinema to be the birthplace of the club of film goers.  Allow true long lasting film appreciation to be nurtured by showing the film more than once without food and at no additional cost. Film appreciation is not promoted by serving food or drink and limiting the showing to seeing it one time. Arrange for seeing film twice with the purchase a ticket for seeing the film a second time time with certain business acumen for selling the cinema as the center of film appreciation rather than presenting the film with the culinary package of junk food. Use the cinema as a center for film fans to get together.  Promote true film appreciation in a way as to develop groups of film fans willing to come together at one place after seeing the film once. Do not limit the showing to one time. The current commercial cinema is a trap and this is one of the many traps waiting people who buy into this method seeing films. Getting refills on popcorn or other food should not be the defining characteristic for seeing a good film. Now it is trendy to leave the cinema and go home rather than stay around and discuss it and see the film a second time. That is what I oppose - this blind habit of accepting the practice of seeing the film once and leaving the cinema. Greater consumption of food is the goal to be avoided at all costs. The more desirable goal is film appreciation and it can't grow from seeing a film once with popcorn and drinks. This review is not composed to blatantly oppose the business interests of the Carlton cinema,  but to merely suggest a better way to use the time that people put forward to become knowledgeable film fans. The traditional method showing a film once with food and drink is most limiting if your desire is to develop circle of film fans who want to become aficionados. Another model is needed soon. Commercial cinemas need to go beyond mass marketing of films as if they are new model cars or clothing styles and promote film appreciation."

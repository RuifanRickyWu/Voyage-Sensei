  "description": "The North End is a nucleus of specialty food restaurants and shops, especially around its Mount Pleasant Village area. Frequented by antiquers for its numerous collectable shops, furniture spots, and oddity stores, the North End is a maverick of the quaint and quality. Vintage toy stores, accessory shops, and cinemas welcome perusers to step back in time, while the wide pedestrian squares and the large medical and business community inject it with a dose of modernity. With numerous cafes and Toronto's greatest number of independent booksellers, it isn't uncommon to see folks in this area at their leisure, reading outdoors and in eateries, and taking life a bit more slowly – even if it's only during their lunch break.",

In downtown Toronto, Yonge Street has plenty of shops and restaurants as well as the famous Eaton Centre Mall and Yonge-Dundas Square. You will also see several theatres, such as the Ed Mirvish and Elgin Winter Garden, and other cultural sites along this road as well as pubs and clubs. Parking can be an issue, so the best way to visit is by using public transit. There are subway stops under Yonge Street as well as bus routes and the innovative PATH system runs underneath, also giving you easy access to the street above."

Back to my original question. Why is Yonge so popular??? Why does every tourist feel the need to walk part of it? Why do suburban knobs noisily roar their motorbikes up and down, and their supercars? When it seems to me to be just about - honestly here - one of the most dull, architecturally bereft streets in the city? I don't get it. But hey, roar your maseratis and loud motorbikes. Scream and yell up and down it when the raptors win, when the bluejays score big, and when Caribana comes to town. Go ahead...it's pretty harmless fun.   "

Past Midtown’s Yonge-Eglinton traffic, North York Yonge-Sheppard hub has a food court/currency exchange below Winners in the Centre, and Empress Walk (connected to Civic Centre library) has a cinema as well. 5. Viva buses via the same Presto card from the terminus Finch station take passengers past Centerpoint Mall to World/Shops on Yonge (7181 Yonge tower), where 6 Boss Caribbean Jerk and Goobok homemade Korean dumplings and donuts are sold in the food court (2nd floor above Seasons Supermarket/parkade). 6. Further, Viva / carride past Hillcrest Mall Richmond Hill will end at Upper Canada Mall, facing GO transit station. 7. From there, by Eagle-Davis Drive Newmarket, it’s a 20-minute carride East of Holland Landing-Bradford’s Yonge St. Mexicanada to cycle by Jackson’s Point Georgina cafes, along Simcoe Lake shoreline. There’s no shortage of things to do or eat—in almost any weather—around Yonge Street. Whatever your means of travel, expect it to be a very long ride!"

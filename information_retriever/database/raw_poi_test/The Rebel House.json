Made my 3 year old cry after an encounter with my mother. She is terrified of even the mention of it. Been going here for over 20 years, but sadly will NOT be back on the weekends. Change the staff. Weekday safe lovely."

I gave a rating of 3 because they ran out of mussels during the day and lime margaritas were pretty weak (don't think it had any tequila). We will visit again and definitely recommend to others."

        "The Rebel is the neighbourhood pub for good food, craft beer and a relaxed friendly vibe. One of the best patios in Toronto in the back, cheery bar seats and tables upstairs. I have been a regular for 20 years and it has always been my spot for comfort food, drinks and enjoying being out. Never disappointed. The food is well above pub fare with mussels and the buffalo burger being my favourites. Daily specials are great. This place is where Rosedale goes to relax. "

        "I've walked by this pub for years because I was not enticed inside by patrons smoking on the sidewalk and the generally grubby appearance of the facade....looks like it hasn't been cleaned, painted or otherwise maintained. The interior is dark and pub-like and there is a patio out back. There were no tables for two downstairs or on the patio when we arrived except at the bar so we were invited to take a table upstairs. We ended up with the entire second floor to ourselves for our 2 and a half-hour catch-up lunch. We enjoyed our salad and meat loaf dinner. The cuisine is a step up from regular pub food and the menu has lots of choices as well as daily specials. The dishes contain interesting ingredients and indicate the chef takes particular care and attention to what comes out of the kitchen. Service was attentive and we were not ignored even though staff had to come all the way upstairs to check on us. A good, reliable alternative if you are in the area."

We thought it slow this weekend with many out of town.  The service was hurried the food was sad.  Sad wilt salad was served.  Brought to server attention and he just dismissed that is the way it is.  Calling the manager felt fruitless.  Not worth going to this establishment as it is unpredictable in quality of service and food.  Take your money elsewhere.  You may play with your health."

        "Most of my reviews are left for the benefit of travellers. In the case of Rebel House I really doubt travellers will be looking for a special place like this in this area. Not really a touristy area. I live in British Columbia and was in Toronto, and invited to join an old friend here for lunch. She grew up in the area and knew the owner very well. He greeted us with a very warm welcome. Looking around at only the main floor I saw that this would be a special experience. We sat near the back, on the main floor in a quaint little 2-person booth. Very unique. Other tables and booths quickly filled this small area. Obviously all regulars, locals. ",
        "Re. service and food: exceptional service from owner and his friendly, funny male server who may be a co-owner for all I know. I was not terribly hungry so had onion soup* and corn bread which was a surprise to see on the menu here. There were dozens of choices and all looked great. My friend had the grilled cheese sandwich which looked so yummy and I almost wish she was going to ask me if I wanted a quarter of it but she wolfed it down!",
        "If I am ever in this area I will surely return here. It is hard to describe. You need to go there to experience it. I would bet that all the food selections are wonderful.",
        "* Incidentally, the onion soup is a clear soup with slices of onion. It's not one of those thick, cheesy, bready French onion soups. I was pleasantly surprised...but I was surprised. A bit pricey at $6.95 for what it was but who cares! I thought the grilled cheese at $8.95 was excellent value. Glass of red $8.95. Corn bread $1.95."

There are other places in the area so I will let others enjoy the \"too rich\" food at the Rebel House."

I had previously visited Bier Markt and was downright disappointed, Rebel House really saved the evening.  The food was lovely, and at a great price point.  The service was casual and relaxed, but attentive.  The beer selection was great, as was the condition of the beer.  This place is going on my top ten list for toronto.",

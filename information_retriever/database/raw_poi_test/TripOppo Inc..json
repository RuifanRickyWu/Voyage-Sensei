        "Now finalizing arrangements for my third trip with TripOppo (formerly Nexus), so I feel I understand some things I would have liked to know before my first. TripOppo offers some of the best bargains in tour packages in every corner of the world, and for that reason their services are invaluable -- even irreplaceable -- for the budget traveler.",
        "There is a downside to this, however:",
        "1. TripOppo does not actually arrange or book the tours it offers, it achieves its competitive prices by brokering packages offered in the host nations. (Therefore the company's knowledge of its offerings is third hand and sometimes vague.)",
        "2. TripOppo is an international Chinese company that has a Canadian office and quotes in Canadian dollars, which is great. But staff language skills for conducting business in English are not adequate. (Therefore communications can be puzzling or questionable.)",
        "3. TripOppo can sometimes make decisions based on cost that are against the interest of passengers. (Therefore twice they have booked me on international flights that required checking out of a hotel at 3:00AM. The second time I caught it in time and refused.)",
        "4. With so many fingers in so many pies across the world, the left hand never seems to know what the right hand is doing. (Once I waited eleven months for them to refund a canceled excursion and finally had to remind them; they did it immediately. And from one communication to the next, even with the booking number in front of them, they cannot recall whether I have paid in full and keep sending forms that I have already completed.)",
        "What this means is that the tourist must take a larger share than usual of avoiding misunderstandings and ensuring that all the details of the tour are completed in a legal and acceptable fashion. Nevertheless, the range of offerings, the competitive prices, and the use of Canadian funds, make this company an essential resource for any Canadian budget traveler. After all, I'm going back for my third tour!"

Japanese food is not to our taste and the breakfasts were not good. Food that should be hot but is served barely lukewarm is unpleasant. The optional Keisaki dinner served in Osaka was an expensive disaster and if the hotel can’t offer a decent meal for $90 US it should be removed from the itinerary. There are long spells on the bus and a short ride on the Bullet train of 15 minutes. Considering all the time wasted to get to the station and hanging about there, it wasn’t worth bothering. Too many temples and shrines and not enough time seeing more local colour such as market.  Any lunch meal was rushed and we were given very little shopping time. Guides were good and the buses comfortable. Anyone planning this tour should lower their expectations regarding food and hotel accommodation."

        "We joined Tripoppo with friends at the beginning of September for a 7 day River cruise of the Rhine and an additional 2 days in Lucerne. It is a beautiful area to visit and I can say that overall the trip was well organized with flights and the daily excursions in the cities along the Rhine. It is a great time to travel with less tourists and good weather. We were told that it was a 5 star ship and it was most definitely not. It was old and tired with a very poor air conditioning system. With above average temperatures, we were given fans to try to cool off the rooms but it was still warm. We heard it was being redone after our cruise but it should have not been used by Tripoppo if they promote a 5 star standard. Generally, the service on the Crucevida ship was good and the crew was courteous and always willing to help. The food was good and well presented. Bigger appetites could be accommodated by ordering larger amounts but we were only told on 3rd day. This must be clarified on day 1. No gym or evening activities were available. Our stay in Lucerne was in a great location with easy access to the main attractions but unfortunately was not air conditioned. I understand that Switzerland is usually cool at this time of year but with global warming it is imperative they hotels be air conditioned. We were given fans but not to much avail. Tripoppo can easily improve this package by making just a few modifications. "

Everything was arranged for us--flights, airport transfers, hotels, tours and excursions, Inca trail train tickets, entrance fees into all major sites,  even seat selection. We asked for an extra two nights in Lima and that was taken care of too, along with tours. The hotels that Nexus had chosen were great, the luxury Amazon lodge truly was luxury in the jungle. The setting, food, accommodations, excursions and guides there were terrific. The tour company, Izi Amigos, that Nexus paired us with in Peru was fabulous. The service provided by Luis Orlando and his guides was outstanding. I highly recommend them!!!  We were met at each location by knowledgeable and very pleasant guides. The sites that we went to see were fantastic. We were escorted to all the airports, Ricardo in Lima and Dennis in Cusco even stayed with us through check in and into  security. What amazing personable service!! We were even treated to a most special and fun evening at Luis' home. We were sad to leave our new friends. This was truly an fascinating trip because of the history, culture and experiencing the incredible Machu Picchu and Sacred Valley.  The arrangements made by Nexus and the services provided by Izi Amigos made the trip amazing."

        "I have to admit that I had my suspicions, especially at such a low price.  You're getting what you pay for.  For example, their \"4 and 5 Star Hotels\" are nothing more than 2-3 Star hotel by North American or European standards.  Comfortable, but positively not luxurious.  The same would apply to the food, mostly buffet-style restaurants with Chinese food that mostly tasted similar to what you'd get here in Canada.",
        "The sites are incredible to see but didn't get to spend near enough time at such venues as The Great Wall or The Terra Cotta Warriors and Horses Museum.  We spent a lot of time on buses being ferried from site to site.  They certainly don't rush you at places like the Tea Plantation or the Silk Factory, which they try to sell, sell, sell.",
        "Shanghai was my highlight of the trip and would certainly fly back on my own to explore this incredible city more thoroughly.",
        "Nexus Holidays completely fell apart on the add-on part of our trip to Hong Kong.  Granted, there were all the protests going on at that time, but we didn't have transport to our hotel waiting for us at the airport and the phone numbers for contacts they provided us didn't work.  We paid ourn transport which Nexus did compensate us for.  Our hotel for very close to the protest area, and we genuinely feared for our safety.  Not once to Nexus contact us to see how we were doing.  A tour of Hong Kong the following day included an unplanned for \"shopping stop\" at a jewellery wholesaler, which ticked everyone on the bus.  A prepaid trip to Macau was a debacle as the taxi taking us to the ferry was very late arriving at the hotel.  We missed our scheduled ferry trip by 45 minutes, then were told that they \"couldn't guarantee our safety\" in the return ferry trip as the ferry terminal was a Ground Zero of the anti-government protests.  We wisely decided to cancel this part of the trip, after communicating with someone in Nexus's Vancouver office.",
        "When we finally returned, we gave our honest feedback to our contact in the Markham office and asked for compensation for both the taxis in Hong Kong and the Macau trip.  Emails to their office went generally unanswered or took weeks to answer with such excuses as \"it's the holidays\".  Finally, Nexus refused to compensate for any part of our cancelled Macau trip (6 people) which is quite expensive.  ",
        "We've used several other tour companies and never had such a bad experience.  I've read other peoples' experiences with Nexus and think perhaps part of the problem was a tour organizer (who'll go unnamed).",
        "I give Nexus a poor rating as opposed to a terrible rating due to the quality of the sites you get to see and the generally take good care of you in China (save and except our tour leader in Beijing).  My recommendation to anyone looking to book anything with Nexus is consider a more expensive and reputable tour operator.  I could never in good conscience recommend this tour company."

Nexus had excellent guides in all the cities, and chose great hotels at each stop. The sights we went to see were fantastic, and it felt like we always spent the right amount of time in each spot. Yes, there are shopping stops where you have to spend a certain amount of time, but in each of those spots, you still get to learn something culturally significant, like learning about jade, pearls, and green tea. The trip also has numerous optional add-ons, which some on our trip didn’t seem to understand. They are certainly optional, but there aren’t really other choices aside from either wandering around the area or sitting on the bus. I cannot emphasize enough how much I recommend that you just do all of optional tours! They were all wonderful, and well worth doing (with the possible exception of the Hangzhou West Lake boat tour, not because it wasn’t great, but just because the lake area is beautiful, and we didn’t get a chance to wander around because we were on the boat).

The hotels in Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos could teach our Western hospitality industry a thing or two.  The tour was so well planned, it was like clockwork.  The guides were amazingly knowledgeable and all spoke good English.  The boat in Halong Bay was first class and the Empress Hotel in Cambodia has no match in the Western World.  It was over the top.  If you are planning to take this tour make sureto take the Laos extension. It is worth while.  Luang Prabang is very beautiful with a relaxing atmosphere. This is the second time we have travelled with Nexus and we would do it again.  They are professionals."

We proceeded the next day to Inkaterra to enjoy our jungle excursion it was amazing the accomdations and food were top notch.We enjoyed tree top trekking,  excursions in the jungle both day and night looking for wild life. The night cruise on the river was stunning. Thanks staff was attentive,and made our stay awesome.We then proceeded to Cusco and Machu Picchu it was an awesome experience. All the guides were very informative and very attentive to our needs. I would strongly recommend this trip you will not be disappointed. Susan and Bob Horning"

        "We arrived in Cairo a few days prior to the start of the tour.  We were considered ‘Land Only’ and did not receive copies of the internal flights. We did not discover this until the day before the flight from Cairo to Luxor. More on the flights later.",
        "The Movenpick Hotel was nice and clean but the food was dull and never hot.  I asked the staff to turn on the chafing dishes and was told that the reason the food was cold was because the lids kept being opened. ",

        "We had early morning starts in order to see everything that Cairo and Egypt has to offer.  This was fine except that the supper meals were served so late.  A diabetic would do very poorly on this tour.",

        "The cruise boat we were on was called the Royal Princess.  It was old, tired and dirty.  The towels and linens were grey.  The hot tub was not heated and this was disappointing as a hot soak was needed after long days of walking.",
        "The Wi-Fi on board had to be purchased and it rarely worked.",
        "The bars were rarely staffed and this made buying water difficult.",

        "We had limited time at the Valley of the Kings. This was made worse by having to wait 30 minutes for Ali to get the tickets.  Couldn’t this be done in advance?",
        "In Aswan, we took horse drawn carriages.  These poor horses were abused with whips, had open sores, visible ribs and were frothing at the mouth due to being forced to run, not trot.  This was absolutely disgusting and Tripoppo should not be encouraging the use of these horses. Half the group took a taxi back to the boat. A taxi or tuk tuk would be appropriate. ",

        "When we flew back to Cairo, we were on 2 different flights this time.  We then got on an old bus to drive in circles to get to TGI Fridays for lunch.  At least an hour was wasted and the driver would not listen to Ali.  He made frightening U-turns and drove backwards on a major highway. This man should never be allowed to drive! The meal at Fridays was ok but not delicious.  I think it would be better to just stay at the airport for lunch.",

        "The Land Mark Hotel in Amman was fabulous but we were not there long enough to enjoy it. The food was delicious and hot!",
        "For people that did not do the optional jeep tour were not given an alternative and had to sit in a restaurant or the bus for 2 hours.  The only option for lunch was a buffet that was expensive. When lunch is not provided, there should be a couple of places to choose from.",
        "The hotel in Petra was old and run down.  It felt like the dining room was in a cave. Thankfully the air conditioning worked.  Dry, cold food again.",
        "Our guide was named Omar.  He did not carry a flag and did not use a head set.  He would begin talking before everyone in the group was present and would act annoyed when asked a question.  He actually ‘shushed’ a lady.  He did not do this to men.  When he spoke, he would have his back to us and would face the thing he was talking about. This made it impossible to hear him.  Most just gave up and walked away. Not everyone on our tour was Christian and Omar spoke as if we all had knowledge of the Bible.  On more than 1 occasion he tried to get us to buy his book.  Shameless self promotion!",
        "The Crown Plaza at the Dead Sea was not a 5 star as promised.  I can’t believe that Crown Plaza's name is associated with is hotel. The rooms were dirty,  A/C did not work and was told that it was winter and would not be turned on.  We had no hot water and when Omar was told about these problems, he did nothing.  The food was ok and hot.",

Peru has a developed tourist industry which has not reached the same level in Bolivia consequently transit between destinations primarily by vehicles is necessary.  Food in both countries was first rate both in presentation and variety.  Hotels were exceptional, planning and logistics were flawless.  Scenery in Bolivia cannot be described since it is spectacular.  The salt flats at Uyuni in Bolivia covering 10,000 square miles has to be seen.  The archaeological sites in both countries are spectacular for anyone interested in history.   All the guides were knowledgeable, attentive and made the trip special.  Only problems were with altitude as some locations 14,360 feet above sea level.  ",

There was lots of time to experience the history of the area. Favorite tours included pyramids, camel rides, wadi rum Jeep tour and hot air balloon ride. Our Tour Leader Robert was exceptional. He made sure all travel connections air, boat and bus went off without a hitch.  We hope that Robert will be our tour leader in future tours with TripOppo. Goid job Robert."

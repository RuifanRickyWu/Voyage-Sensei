I also got a photo ID card which is also in the mail. However I have never had any issues with health card up until this point. We go on in and they study my health card meticulously. They then ask for a second piece to which I explain that I don’t have one on me and my passport which is it at home is expired. I show my sin card, smart serve, credit card, and two debit cards all with my name on it. After an incredibly rude back and forth with door men saying that the photo (that I took when I was sixteen) looks way older than me, we concluded I needed to go home and get my EXPIRED passport. My friend speaks to the bar manager, John Pitts and explains to him that my passport is expired and we don’t want to pay for an uber all the way home to retrieve an expired passport if they won’t let us in with it. John Pitts then says if i come with passport which he is aware that is expired,then we’re fine and he will let us in (even though it is expired). I come back with my birth certificate, passport (expired) health card, sin card, smart serve, credit card and two debit cards. ",

I’ve spent upwards $100 and am quite inconvenienced. My friend goes back to attempt to calmly reason with them, to which they proceed to call her a c***",

They made me take my hair down, uncomfortably studied me for ages, all for ID that is very clearly me. I have red hair and the flash in he picture I suppose made it look more red?",

On my way back, the bouncer told my friend and I that we were not allowed back in because we appeared too \"intoxicated\". I was pretty shocked, offered to show him I could walk in a straight line, and tried reasoning with him. In my experience bars usually encourage females to stay. When I tried walking in the first time, he stiff armed me and grabbed me. I'm a tiny female so that was hardly necessary. He didn't let us back in, even though some friends I was with had about 10x as much as I had. The bar tenders were also unpleasant, and the hallway leading to the bathrooms smelt like urine soaked towels. I won't be going back!"

I've been seeing shows here since February '86, when I saw Bad Manners. There used to be a Chinese snack bar in the wall on the right-hand side, which has long since disappeared--don't visit hungry. I recently saw Cults there, which was excellent. Only bummer was a couple of rude young women who apparently have no knowledge of the words \"excuse me\". Strange thing, all the young guys were very polite. Upstairs is the Dance Cave--I used to go in '87 and it was cool with Marva Jackson spinning vinyl. I know it's geared to youngsters and haven't been in many moons. I'm clueless about it now as an old guy."

I got a call from outside telling me that the bouncer would not let one of the ladies in because she was \"drunk\" in his view; he also went on to call her \"too short to hold her liquor\".

I spoke to the ticket person at the door who tried to call the manager (nowhere to be seen or ultimately to be found); she did say she cannot do anything. The other bouncers were \"more understanding\", but could not really do anything because the \"top\" security guard made his decision, with no breathalyzer and no real reason other than he had to show he was the \"decision-maker\" who could use his \"power\" over whoever he wanted whenever he wanted.

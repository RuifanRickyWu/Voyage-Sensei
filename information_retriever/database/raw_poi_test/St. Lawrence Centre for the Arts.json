The timing was off and thus the show longer than advertised. It's unclear who this show is geared towards, but it was not a good parody of the Harry Potter novels. What a waste of money. "

        "We enjoyed the show We saw Champions if Magic - it was very entertaining.  We were disappointed with the accessibility of the theatre.  One party in our group was on Crutches so we changed our seats from the balcony to the orchestra level in the handicap seating area.  There is a lift but you need to find a staff member in order to use it - we asked several people before we found a person to help us but she said there were just as many stairs to our seats from the lift that they were just less steep.  We  ended up just using the stairs but they sent us to the wrong entrance and so my daughter ended up going down twice as many stairs as she had too only to have to go back up half of them.  Then when we got there we saw where the lift went and if she had of taken it she would have only had to go down three small ramp type steps.  It was a brutal experience.  The theatre needs to improve this process for people with mobility issues and educate their staff better in order to properly assist people that have mobility issues.  "

        "This is a review of one performance: The Overcoat. Having recently read The Overcoat by Russian writer Gogol, I was excited to see how the short story translated into opera. I've seen many operas and musicals in Toronto and elsewhere and this was bar none the worst performance I have ever seen. For the first time in my life I refused to clap - the disgraceful way the mentally ill were portrayed pushed the perfornance from awful to intolerable. The original brilliant story is about a humble, ordinary, poor man who copies documents. The transformation into a vapid semi-musical (there were no actual songs) about an accountant made no sense. The actors overdid it at every turn, never showing one moment of subtlety.Shockingly, this show received rave reviews, which makes me question the entire theatre scene in Toronto. Go and see Come From Away instead - it is brilliant!"

This is a well-deserved honor, as this British-style brass band (no French horns, of course!) plays some of the most interesting and challenging music written for this up-an-coming genre. The British-style brass band is not what you think! With over 400 bands playing this formula in the UK alone, and hundreds more around the globe, it offers a remarkably fun and fascinating repertoire, ranging from Broadway, to Latin jazz, to Movie themes (especially John Williams!), and includes was moving and exciting classical music as well as contemporary music written just for this format. The St. Lawrence Center offers many other types of groups as well, and stresses innovation and high performance values. But if you are in town, if you have ever played in a band, or just want to hear something exciting and new, if the Hannaford Street Band is playing at the St. Lawerence....go for it!"

The play was pretty much sold out with a high school group there, which meant for a noise-y and crowded theatre.  Once the play began you could hear a pin drop.  It's a movingly eloquent production which my husband said was the best theatre he had seen in years."

Service at the food-and drink counter during the intermission was fast."

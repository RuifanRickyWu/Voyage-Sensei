Beatrice and Roger were great hosts driving the group around and sharing details of the history of the city and the present happenings of construction of new light rail lines. Bea explained the importance of The Asian Canadiens contributions to the city during the emergence of Toronto.  Bea gave us restaurant recommendations to visit for authentic local cuisines.

Our final stop at the winery was much better than expected. We even purchased a few bottles of wine.

Reached by 11.45 am from where busses took us to table rock area whee the fall was outstanding & there I made up my mind to stay a night, therefore went to Sheraton as it was the best as near to all attractions.  After checking inn went outside for the boat ride which takes us near the fall. The experience was outstanding. After the boat ride came to hotel, got the room & went to sleep but in evening I changed the room as there was elevator sound like plane engine. Got a better & bigger room. Walked in night too as the area is big so had to cover. Slept at 12 am midnight."

We had a great time visiting 3 wineries. The highlight was the Hardwood Estate Winery with wine and food pairing and also our driver and a tour guide Gilley.  He was very knowledgable about the area and the wines and made the afternoon enjoyable for everyone. Great job Gilley.   The only suggestion I have for PEC Wine Tours and the only reason why I am giving 4 stars is Casa Dea winery.  It should be taken off the tour since it was very impersonal, nobody talked to us about the wines and nobody was interested in our presence there."

        "I paid $2,000 for a bus to hold 30 friends and family for a 40th birthday party. We did a few wineries and then dinner. Everything was great except for the bus. It was an old bucket of bolts with no working air conditioning except for the driver. Seemed all the air for the bus was blowing on him!  I had 2 elderly people on board that did not do well and were over heating   I was quite concerned as one of them was standing the entire way to try and get some air that was drifting out of a vent!  Half the bus was standing trying to get to the little breeze coming from a vent in the ceiling. This was the worst limo/bus experience I have ever had. It ruined the day for everyone as we were dying on that bus. When I booked I was told that they were giving me a newly refurbished bus!  If this was refurbished I would hate to see the other buses they have. I paid more to rent this piece of junk than it was actually worth. Don’t ever rent anything from this company. They are a rip off. "

        "I hired This company for two days in June Saturday and Sunday. We hired one bus for Saturday and two for Sunday for a convention. I was told by the owner (I believe his name is Peter at phone number 1 (416) 502-2522) the bus held up to 55 people he knew that my convention was for adults. On Saturday when the bus arrived it didn’t even fit 40 people comfortably but we squeezed as many as we could in and some people took their own vehicles into downtown Toronto and many had to stand. Then when we got back to the hotel I called the office and told him that we would need a bigger buses. He instantly started yelling at me and threatened to cancel the two buses for the next day which would’ve literally ruined our convention because the day involved all day of traveling. He claimed that he said the bus held 55 children. After I managed to calm him down he agreed to send a third smaller bus to Accommodate the leftover people. The next morning the third bus never did show up so several of my members had to take their own vehicles and we squeezed in as many as we could on the two buses. The buses themselves were dirty, one bus was extremely hot and one bus was extremely cold, neither of the bathrooms worked and it was very outdated and tacky. The next day there was a charge on my visa for the 3rd bus that never showed up. I had to go through my bank to fight this. The owner of this company is 100% a shady, scummy crook. "

        "Our kids rented this bus for their prom.  Suppose to be one of the best nights of their life, but turned into a disaster!  The driver, asked the parent that signed the contract for $500 non refundable deposit so the kids could have a beverages on the bus.  We said no not in the contract, and it suppose to be zero tolerance.  He left with the kids on the bus and beverages in cups, we thought all was good.  Until one of the kids called and said he demanded $500 or they were kicked off the bus.  He practically held them hostage, because if they didn’t pay it, they would be kicked off the bus.  After a lengthy conversation with the guy at 416- 502-2522, who denied being the same company, told the driver to give them the money back. He cannot ask them for money to drink on the bus.  So, money given back and then, we get another call, saying he won’t let them back on the bus without paying $500!  What!!  The driver did let them back on but was told by their boss to terminate the deal and leave the kids stranded. But fortunately he has some compassion and continued until the job was down.  But not till after parents had to meet up with the bus and have another discussion...  and watch out sweat drenched kids come off the bus as the air conditioning didn’t work properly...  neither did the toilet or the sink.  Long and short... do not use this company, they will steal your money."

Their confirming email stated  nothing of a non refundable deposit. They where ignorant, disrespectful and rude. Do not book with them.

        "The worst limo service in Canada. I've been in limos dozens of times and I've never seen anything like this. They ruined my brother's wedding. The limo did not have air conditioning, and the whole wedding party got to the wedding drenched in sweat. It was very dirty, there was black grease in the seats and floor, and one of the bridesmaid's dresses was stained just by sitting on the dirty seat. Also, this is the first time I get in a limo that had no music. An uber would have been better. The best part is that when we called to complain, the owner didn't even want to listen to the complaint and denied everything, saying that he will \"sue\" us if we write a bad review... What a joke of a company. "

We rented this limo company for a wedding and I would NEVER recommend this company to anyone. We went over on the time we had booked and the limo driver refused to move until we paid more up front. That’s the last thing a bride and groom want to deal with on their wedding day. After we paid the driver an additional $200 dollars, he finally agreed to take us to our next destination. When I called to complain about the quality of the service, like the rundown limo and the fact that the air conditioning was not sufficient, and the aux was not working to play music the manager Tony was rude and called my claims “bullsh*t”, and that he would sue me, and that this was war. This company is a joke, and clearly, they don’t care to keep you as a repeat customer. DO NOT BOOK WITH THEM."

He took me to the car to make the payment and immediately said you can add your tip and I said it was included in the final price already which was 17% tip. I didn't add a tip and then he told me no open alcohol in the vehicle we were doing a wine tour so just started the day off bad. Driver didn't get out of the vehicle once until the end of the night we were unpacking the limo....then he started threatening us that he was charging us the clean up fee for the carpet having a little gravel on it from getting in and out. My husband took pictures of the inside which we left clean and we immediately went into the house and cancelled our credit card for fear of what charges they would put through. The limo was an old run down limo to start with and didn't look like the carpets had been shampooed in a very long time, it was raining and the water was leaking in through the roof somewhere, the one door didn't close and lots of wind noise."

First back in August a limo from his company was 1 and a half hours late and he refused to even give us a partial refund despite all 20 people having to pay cover for arriving late to the venue. Now I booked a pink limo and was told over the phone that it should fit 20, now reading the contract it only says 14-16 people fit. After calling to come to an agreement on how cancellation will be handled the owner Tony became very hostile and unprofessional calling me \"stupid\" and that \"customers are not right\" and that I'm \"rude\" (along with some other rude words) and that I won't find a pink limo anywhere else that fits over 16 people all while I maintained a positive tone the whole time because I knew what I was up against. Tony proceeded to keep talking over me not letting me say anything and made me feel very uncomfortable even though this was all just over the phone. Bottom line, if something goes wrong with the limo or booking be prepared to get yelled at in a very unprofessional manner."

The service for my brother's wedding was ok...despite having a dirty limo at pick up...so I decided to use them for my wedding in September. At first you think the service is great over the phone. The owner, John, was willing to work on pricing (keeping in mind I needed 2 full sized limos round trip and 2 separate cars for a pick up for myself and my new husband and my grandparents to get home). JUST WHEN YOU THINK everything is good to go, the email confirmations are completely wrong. Wrong pick up times, wrong locations, etc. still was able to correct everything well in advance of the day. THE DAY BEFORE something told me in my gut to call them again...well turns out they didn't have a car on record to take me and my husband home!",
        "You're thinking, not so bad yet...right? Well we had an arrangement with the owner to pay via cheque (not cash or credit card) because what bride and groom would have over $2k with them to hold on their wedding day. The driver that showed up refused to accept the cheque and demanded cash or credit only and this was 5 minutes before we had to leave for my ceremony. The driver MADE ME AND MY BRIDESMAIDS go to the bank to take out money. At this point I'm 30 minutes late for my own wedding. When we gave him the cash, he took another 10 minutes to count the cash in front of my family before driving the 5 minutes left we had to get to the venue. He also ran over a curb and scraped the bottom of his hummer limo (karma!). The hummer sounded absolutely terrible after that and I pulled up to my wedding ceremony with nothing but the sounds of a terrible hummer as walking music.",
        "Then for the pickup on the way home, there was again no car to take me and my husband home. The drivers of the other cars that were there (yes the same terrible hummer limo) had no idea who or where my car was. They tried calling the owner of the company and he never answered. The third car arrived almost an hour late. The limos were again dirty and the drivers were all terrible.",

Needless to say my brother in law was also over an hour late to the wedding he was supposed to be the MC for...WORST COMPANY EVER"

Then I sent them an email requesting my deposit back after about 10 days because I still haven't received the $200 and he said there was nothing he could do and it was refunded on his end so I need to dispute it with my bank... well I asked him for a receipt showing my 200$ refund and the one I got was $0.00 and he said it was how they have been doing it for 10 years.... great well now its been almost 3 weeks and no refund... no discount on the leaking limo bus....",

Not joking) Then told me to call my own tow truck. My neighbour ended up coming over and pull the driver out.

        "-Driver was extremely difficult to understand and was unable to pull the limo into the desired location (even though several have before including our drop off who had no issue).",
        "-Because of traffic, our driver drove so erratically on the highway so he could make his next appointment that on every touch of the break we were dislodged from our seats. One brake was so bad my mother and sister fell out of their seats and spilled their beverages all over their clothing. This resulted in us having to immediately change once we reached the hotel. ",
        "-When we finally arrived at the location the driver once again was not able to follow the instructions of the hotel staff and we were forced to exit and unload our belongings as quickly as possible while we blocked flow-through traffic.",
        "On the way back:",
        "-Driver was an hour and 30 minutes late for pick up. Pick up time was 12pm and driver did not arrive until almost 1:30pm. We had left our suite at 11:30am to ensure we were ready for pick up at 11:45am (just in case the driver was early). At 12:10pm we had not heard from the driver at all and we decided to proactively reach out to her. The driver would have known WAY before this time that she would not be able to make the scheduled pick up. Why was it our responsibility to reach out to her AFTER the pick up time had already passed? This is very poor customer service. Not to mention that we could have easily stayed in our suite and enjoyed our time longer if we had known in advance that the driver would be so late.",
        "-Driver tried calling us several times for \"directions\" even though we very clearly told her that we were just visiting and did not know the area well. She was unable to find the address and told us she was \"on the street in front of an Applebees\". Her implying that we should meet her at this location was absurd as we all had suitcases and coolers with us and were not going to take all of our belongs out of the hotel and down the street. ",
        "-When the driver finally arrived she immediately got out of the limo in flow-through traffic and told us that she had been on the road for so long she needed to use the bathroom. We instructed her to go inside while we loaded the trunk but she would not go by herself and my sister had to escort her to the bathroom, wait for her to finish, and then escort her back to the limo. ",
        "-The limo itself was filthy and not of the same caliber as the limo we arrived in. ",
        "--You could barely see out the windows. ",
        "--The handles on both doors were missing decorative hardware. ",
        "--Garbage from the previous riders were still in the limo (empty bottles in the bar). ",
        "--There was no ice provided.",
        "--There were no self controls to control any of the limo features (ie, lights, etc) except for a cheap car radio that had been installed.",
        "-When I asked the driver to put up the partition she said “it’s broken and even if it wasn’t it’s illegal now to put up the partition”. Again, this is very poor customer service and we did not have any issue with the partition with our original driver. I'm not sure why she would tell us that but because of this, we were given no privacy and the remainder of our trip was awkward because we did not want to disrupt or distract her driving. ",
        "-When we finally arrived at our destination, she said she “didn’t have time” to tidy up and asked us to remove all of our garbage and empty bottles. This was extremely disappointing as clearly the limo had not been cleaned prior to our trip and now we were expected to do her job for her.",
        "After paying this kind of money, and after the experience we had, I will not be inclined to use their services again nor would I ever recommend them to family and friends. Quite the contrary. Please book with anyone else and save yourself the grief."

        "First and foremost, I want to express how incredibly disappointed we are with your \"professional\" limousine service. We booked this limousine many months ago and had a set scheduled time to pick the groomsmen up at 2:30pm. As per the email we received prior to the pick-up, the groom contacted the limousine driver Christine 3 hours prior to scheduled pick-up to ensure her that the groom was still on time. When the groom contacted Christine, she didn't even know what time she was supposed to pick the groomsmen up. The groom told her 2:30pm and her shocking response was \"I will try to be there on time,\" which she certainly was not. Christine arrived 20 minutes late. The groom and groomsmen had actually grabbed their own car keys because they were just about to get into their own cars and drive themselves to the venue. When Christine arrived, Tyler made the final payment with his credit card on file. Christine then told Tyler he needed to sign the receipt. When Tyler asked for a pen to sign it, Christine did not have a pen to provide him to sign the receipt. Since, he was already late, he asked her to drive them to the venue and he would grab a pen and sign it once they arrived at the wedding. Christine then rudely asked Tyler to step out of the vehicle and stated that she wasn't going anywhere until the receipt was signed, yet neglected to provide or find a pen. It wasn't until someone contacted her on her radio asking where she was that she decided to finally drive the groom and groomsmen to the venue. When the groom got back into the limo, Christine then asked him how to get to the venue and the groom had to provide directions to the driver the entire way there. I've been in many limousines in my life and I have never experienced having to give a driver directions to where we are going, especially on my own wedding day. As a result of this poor and unprofessional service my wedding was delayed by 25 minutes and the groom was very stressed and upset on what should be the best day of his life.",
        "When I contacted the service with my complaint, they basically told me I didn't book the more expensive wedding package so too bad so sad, you get what you pay for. Not to mention their English was so terrible it looked as though an 8 year old wrote the email. I guess $700 isn't enough money to get good quality service."

I had to request 3 times for the initial pick up address to be changed as the confirmation was sent with an incorrect address in a completely different city. The pick up was at a local park where all the kids go to for pictures and then on to the venue. No where on the form you fill out to book is there any where to request a drop off address for the return drop off. I assumed the driver would have been asked where they wanted to be dropped off. My mistake, I should not have assumed!! Instead the driver took the kids, back to the park area, not even the park but up the street. When my daughter asked him to take the group to our home he threw the confirmation at her and told her that this was where he was dropping them off because that is what the confirmation said and left the group of teens on the side of the road. My daughter called me upset and luckily my husband and another mother were close by to pick them up. I emailed them the next day to say that we were disappointed in the driver leaving them there and that maybe they should revise their forms to confirm all the information and the response I got was extremely rude blaming me for the mix up and said that I need to \"revise my words and assess the situation\" . The whole situation was turned around about me not filling the form out correctly. MY issue is that the driver left the group of teens on the side of the road late at night. He did not apologize for the driver leaving the kids there and continued to blame everything on my error. Just an acknowledgment that it was a bad decision on the drivers part would have been nice. "

The vehicle (Cadillac Escalade ESV) was nice, clean and able to accommodate us and our luggage. Vehicle arrived early for pickup, which was very warm welcomed. Communication with the driver was excellent as well. He answered all of my questions and gave the best advice on how best to book since my family and I arrived in Toronto on two different flights. I definitely will use always in future visits and recommend others it’s really family transportation and all above fair pricing with great services."

        "I would first like to start this off by saying that I am a pretty easy going person, and I rarely complain about services. It was my first time using this company and I had higher expectations, especially for the price that I paid. The driver met my guest and I at the location that was decided, and was transparent about taking a couple of minutes to get there due to the traffic. I appreciated that! He said he would call me again when he arrived at the decided location. Luckily I had asked what the plate number was, because he did not call me when he got to the location. ",
        "When I got into the vehicle, I thought there would be water bottles included during the trip, as stated in the details, but there weren't any. If I had known, I would have purchased water before heading into the car. I also thought the driver would be more professional. During the drive, he answered a few calls and seemed to have a harsh tone with the person he was talking to. It was kinda terrifying. Lastly the driving was a bit scary as well. The driver would switch lanes even though the lines on the road were solid. For someone who is anxious in cars, it was definitely a scary experience for me and my guest. I do not think I will use this service again :("

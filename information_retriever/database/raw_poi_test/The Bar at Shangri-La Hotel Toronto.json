        "Was trying to look up a place for a place to wind down for the Friday evening and realized that Shangri-La has live music from 8ish onwards to close. So we headed there, its acoustic live jazz with intermission in between. For the free music, the steep drink prices were justified... ~$18+ for a cocktail and the fact that it was a hotel bar. ",

People are very well dressed and the high class atmosphere, top flight service make it worth to visit. A great place to cool off or as adult lounge to enjoy a few drinks before going to the next spot. Friday nite crowd with DJ was fantastic for us to stop in for a drink after our dinner at next door restaurant."

Service was a little slow, but it was busy, and some of the drinks the bartenders were making were quite time-consuming!  As it got later into the evening, it was less busy, and service was excellent.",

Clientelle is well dressed and the drinks are pricey (min $20.00 CAN per cocktail) but the high class atmosphere, top quality service and sophisticated adult crowd make it worth the extra cost. A great place for a first date, or any kind of romantic engagement, or simply effective as a snazzy, adult-centric lounge to enjoy a few pre-drinks before hoppin'to the next spot."

Only minor complaint was the service- a little slow for our liking, and we had to request the dessert menu. Given the quality of the dessert offerings, we felt the menu should be readily accessible. Overall wonderful experience. "

Slow to bring munchies. Drinks are quite expensive, so we expect better service, especially when it's not busy. ",

Beautiful marble throughout. Appreciated this as the facilities at Trump were terribly filthy. At a 5 star, facilities should be tidy and spotless.",

        "We went to meet another couple in the lobby of the Shangri-La for a few drinks last night.  The decor and ambience was nice, and the band was a nice touch.  The waitresses, howver, were finding it a struggle to do their jobs.  We waited anywhere from 10-20 minutes for each drink and they had consisently forgotten our orders.  I went to the bathroom twice, and athough, they were nice facilities, the stalls were missing toilet paper, and this was after housekeeping was in.  When the time came for the bill, the waitresses had given us somebody else's bill, which, at this point wasn't a surprise.  The girl seemed to struggle with the merchant machine as well.  I understand that people make mistakes and drop the ball from time-to-time, but these girls were consistent.  It appears that they weren't trained well, or were understaffed, but regardless of why, I expected a better experience."

        "The Bad: The Service was poor, and not very attentive. It lacked follow-up to see if we wanted additional beverages (we did, no one asked, so we didn’t order additional) or if our desserts were good (They weren’t). ",
        "The Ugly: The desserts. It really was the saddest example I’ve seen in a long time of someone trying so hard to create art on a plate (which they didn’t achieve either) that they forget the simple point of dessert. Be Decedent. Be that little guilty pleasure that I scrape my fork unabashed against the plate to get the last little bits of flavor. My advice: Rip the dessert menu out, start from scratch. You’re a luxury hotel, make sure your lobby bar staff are attentive enough that the $15 to $22 dollar cocktails you’re trying to sell to your clients they are able to buy."

It was impossible to dissolve into the soy sauce. I highly suggest the chef go to Chinatown to learn how to properly make Har Gow. Btw, the calamari was the worst I've ever had and it used the same Cajun spice as the table popcorn. What a travesty. Shame. "

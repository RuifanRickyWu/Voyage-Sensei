        "Before Yorkdale and West Edmonton Mall, there was no indoor shopping centre except Harrod’s in London, England. The beauty of Yorkdale is it’s at the accessible intersections of highway 401/Allen Rd.-Dufferin Street, near Highway 400/Black Creek & opposite the Toronto Transit Commission subway station. Good as new, the renovated food court above the ‘illy’ mezzanine is very international.  Accessible washrooms are available below there by the West hall/ Starbucks, too. For brunch, I love ordering Israeli haloumi shakshuka at Cafe Landwer’s at the far corner (with covered outdoor patio), where Restoration Hardware dining used to be. Then, finish nearby there with iced latte (dark or matcha $7) at %Arabica, just inside the doors of G /“H Southwest” close to the Apple computer and Plus shoe stores. At night, Cheesecake Factory beside the Hudson’s Bay and Joey’s (G/H entrance)  light up. If it’s a special occasion, you can even pick up birthday candles at Shoppers Drug Mart by Harry Rosen menswear—the opposite far end of the mall by Dufferin and not the benches near the skypass to reach the TTC station. Underground parking there (close to TTC) and beside Holt Renfrew are the best places to find a spot if arriving in the morning. Otherwise, there’s sometimes covered spots in the older lot by SportChek/Taiwanese bubble tea, Northeast entrance (near Crate & Barrel or where Chapters’ Indigo bookstore used to be). If you’re not in a rush, escalators above the Uniqlo facing H&M feature movies in the theatre on the East side for catching a late night show. Women’s wear is past there by walking South toward Tiffany’s. The centre hall also has Coach handbags, Pottery Barn and Burberry stores, intersecting with Santa’s accessory lane (shoes and jewellery) before Michel’s Baguette cafe. There’s something for literally everybody in this shopping mall. My only recommendation would be avoiding the parking lot when it’s busiest: holiday weekends and Professional Development days…when youth are allowed to skip school on a Friday afternoon. To get away from the noise, there are some other dining options outside the mall, on the opposite side from Dufferin’s gas station on Orfus (e.g. Seoul House). Beware the potholes, and enjoy a day at North America’s first indoor mall of the savvy Eastern shopper!"

      "title": "Little enforcement of covid rules at \"world-class\" mall",
      "text": [
        "During the most recent shutdown in March,  I have been in the mall regularly and have been disappointed at the next to zero enforcement of covid rules I've witnessed at this supposedly \"high-end\" mall. During the most recent shutdown, the food court tables were closed to in-person dining, and the tables were removed at other places in the mall, such as Starbucks or Tim's, so that people could not sit down and eat. Fine. The rule during this period has been takeout only, and food is not supposed to be consumed inside. So why on every visit in March did I see dozens of shoppers shuffling along around me with their masks fully pulled down below their chins, as they sip coffee, slurp their smoothies or juices, eat sandwiches, frozen yogurt, french fries etc?  At the Eaton Centre I saw large signs telling people they cannot eat food. I have walked long distances in Yorkdale without ever seeing a single sign. No signs at the entrance telling this, no signs directly in front of the outlets that sell food or drinks. The only signs I have seen are stickers on window ledges telling people they cannot eat under Toronto law. Nobody would see these notices unless they were standing directly over these window ledges. It's possible there were signs in the food court, which I did not visit specifically because I didn't want to be near people who were ignoring the rules. But what is the point of closing tables at your food court if everyone is then permitted to walk anywhere and eat with their masks pulled down? I realize security can't be everywhere when there are hundreds of people in the mall, but signs would at least help to make people aware. Apart from the stickers, the only signs I have seen anywhere were telling us \"what we are doing to keep you safe,\" which boast about how they are cleaning the mall more often etc. But no signs telling people this most basic rule: No eating or drinking. So here we are in early April, and the province had to shut down yet again and malls were closed yet again, because our ICU units are filled to capacity and more contagious variants are making many young people sick more easily than the first strain. Covid is now much easier to catch. But go ahead everyone, keep shopping with your masks pulled down, because a deadly virus shouldn't interfere with your yogurt. When covid rules are being ignored or treated casually at so many places by so many people, I was not surprised in the least that we are shutting down yet all over again."

Because of the delays in shipping I decided to purchase it early so it obviously passed the 14 day mark to return it. Once my ten year old nephew wore it a couple of times, he was sad to see the zipper broke right off. My sister has been in contact with the returns department and they will not provide a refund or a new jacket (which is what she wants) instead they told her it is passed the 14 day return period. She has indicated that because of a birthday it was ordered early and in the box set for the gift to be opened. They are refusing to exchange it. I will no longer be purchasing OVO's products in store or online. I will also be posting pictures of the jacket so that everyone can see what they are buying."

        "There are pick pockets in the mall food court. I went there, and while waiting in the Chipotle line, my backpack was opened up and a charger code was stolen. This occurred with a food court packed with people. I did feel some tugging on my bag, but I thought someone was bumping me from behind as the food court was super crowded.  Well never again will I wear a backpack to go shopping there. I've been to the Eaton Centre and never been robbed.  Beware of your surroundings at all times. Due to the crowded nature of the mall, it would be very easy to have your wallet or purse stolen without you even realizing it.",
        "As an aside, the food court is way too small for all the people who use it. It should be about 3-4 times the size that it currently is. You have to luck out to get a seat."

        "There are many stores to shop, especially if you are interested for high end brands. But, I will most likely not go there if I’m not buying anything. There are very few chairs to sit if you get tired. It’s super crowded. It’s giving me headache to stroll. Had dinner at Cheesecake Factory that was an hour and a half wait. Nothing to do at the mall except find a chair to sit on."

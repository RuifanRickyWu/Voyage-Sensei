        "I do love this venue and it was a great show (NKOTB & Paula Abdul) however I bought a $62 tshirt and when I checked my account the next day I noticed I was actually charged $140 for it. Since then I have tried to speak with someone at Budweiser Stage but have yet to hear back. When discussing with friends I learned that this is pretty common practice there. As they are a no cash venue they often just pass the debit/cc machine with the tap portion and don’t show you the total so I strongly urge you to double check every transaction."

        "5) the lawns are never maintained anymore. what was once nice grass is now consistently mud, dirt, woodchips",
        "6) they no longer allow you to hang out, buy merch or food after the show and immeidately rush you out",
        "7) bag policy has gotten much more strict. the  max size limit is too small to even hold a  towel, unless you purvhase one of their clear bags, which is likely to get you mugged after the show. alternatively if you do bring a bag, they force you to pay for lockers of which there arent that many of and there is only one line so you're waiting even longer",
        "8) they do nothing to notify or accomodate people for the massive inconveneince that is actually getting to the venue due to the honda indies",
        "worst of all (and i've seen this is a common complaint), their \"customer service\" is terrible and near non existent.  went to complain the other night that they should have made a public annoucnement when a band went on early as we were stuck in line waiting for food/ drinks we had already paid for resulting in missing the first few songs. they basically said sorry not sorry since its the band who decides when to go on, not them. when i told them thats not an acceptable answer since even if the band decides, as they venue they are responsible and they have more than enough employees for one to go up to the mic and let people know...they then tried to gaslight me saying i should have known when buying the tickets that times are subject to change without notice and its my fault if i didnt read the TOC.  i responded saying thats only true in the event of a delay...they left me on \"seen\", even after i tried to follow up giving them the benefit of the doubt in case they just forgot to respond. finally i said \"so just to recap, first you refuse to accept any responsibility. then you fully blame the band and me as a customer...and now you're ghosting me for calling you out on it?\"... of cource i was once again left on \"seen\""

        "Attended our first concert at Budweiser Stage in Toronto to see Yacht Rock Review, REO Speedwagon and Train on July 20, 2024. We took the GO train from Union station to the Exhibition GO stop, about a 10 minute ride. Arrived early and went through the Security gate, check before going on what you are allowed to bring in with you. We bought our tickets off of Groupon for the concert and they worked well, I just scanned the Groupon voucher off of my phone on the way in. Once inside there are a lot of food and drink stands on your way into the concert seating area. The concert started on time and went from 6:25pm to 11:00pm. We had originally bought lawn seating but were upgraded to seats under the roof. So happy we got these as it was standing room only on the lawn. Sound was very good and they had some large screens to watch on each side of the stage. During the break between bands there was a significant lineup for the women's washroom at the front entrance, but people did not know that there are other washrooms near the  back of the park also. The concert venue did do an announcement that helped a lot, but just be aware. The PRO's: The concert went off on time and sound/lighting was excellent. The large screens on either side of the stage helped out a lot when people were standing up for some songs. Definitely consider taking public transit to and from the event. Lots of people around to help with any questions while there. CONS: The drink and food prices were too expensive. Also the bicycle rick shaw's at the exit were also expensive and pricing did not seem to be regulated at all, some people bartering on the spot. We opted to walk to the Exhibition GO station instead. Overall a very positive experience and we will be back for more concerts."

        "Attended the Counting Crows/Santana concert last night at the Budweiser Stage. The sound was awful. The high end was distorted and grating to the ear. Midrange was lacking. Clarity was absent. The bottom end was excellent. Great show, but it was disappointing that the mix degraded the sound. Experienced the same sound at an outdoor concert a few years ago at Port Credit. I assume the sound is controlled by venue personnel. The bands should have the control of their sound. I read a number of prior reviews complaining about the Budweiser sound. Would love to hear from others who attended last night."

It's possible that had the concert happened on a regular Saturday night, my impression could have been different. With that in mind...",
        "I found the Budweiser Stage to just be kind of meh. I enjoyed the fact that it's on the water - so it's got a nice backdrop - and the bathrooms were clean, which is also a big plus. I found the staff to be helpful in directing me to my seat, which was also great! ",
        "Unfortunatley, however, parking was very difficult to find, and also expensive. The way the food vendors(?) were laid out was an interesting concept, but that area needed more seating to be enjoyable. I also found it difficult to find something aside from water or alcohol to drink.  ",
        "What really coloured my perception of the venue was the following: During the last song before the band's encore, someone random came in and sat down in the row in front of me that had several unoccupied seats in it. He was wearing a high-vis vest as though he blonged at the venue in some way, but he was acting very sketchy. He kept trying to offer me some kind of snack, which was weird enough, but he was being over-the-top for the kind of music that was playing. He kept digging in his backpack, and putting on what looked to be old/used wristbands from past shows. Then at one point \"dropped\" something that rolled down to the rows in front of his. He immediatley went after whatever it was, but was under the seats for a suspiciously long time, so I went to security to alert them to this guy, and sure enough - he had been trying to swipe people's stuff! I've never been more glad to listen to my gut instinct! ",
        "So because the venue is open air, I suspect this kind of thing is not uncommon, unfortunatley. If you happen to be going to a show here, make sure you bring a small bag that you can keep on your person, just in case more folks like this guy are lurking around. ",
        "I also found leaving the venue once the show was over, to be a bit frustrating because of all of the bottlenecks happening. All in all though, not the worst venue, but also not the best. I'd go back to see my favourite band play, but that's about it."

My son tells me that History, venue owned by Drake in the Beaches is a great place to watch bands. He saw Protest the Hero there last week. There are no seats. People can stand. Security is subtle but effective."

        "Hozier performed here, what an amazing and memorable show. I prefer seated concerts, but on the off chance, I booked floor seats in the pit for this particular performance. It has been over a decade since I have been to Budweiser, when I last went it was still the Molson Amphitheatre. Hozier, his band, and the opening act Madison Cunningham both have terrific vocals and are excellent live.  His voice is everything you would expect and more. It was totally worth it to see him perform in person and in his prime. Fantastic evening!"

        "Went to see Sting in concert, first time at Budweiser stage. The venue is easy to get to via TTC, with a short walk to the entrance. This is a smaller venue, so there aren't the huge crowds entering or exiting. There is stadium type seating, some of which is partly covered by a roof (the sides are partially open too), although standard width the seats have a generous amount of room in front, so people could easily get by, without you needing to stand up. There's a grassed area at the back of the venue, where you can bring your lawn chairs, although furthest distance from stage. There are lots of alcohol vendors and a few food places, they stop serving drinks at 10pm, although some of the food places were open at the end of the concert. The view of the stage was awesome in the 200 section, sound system was great.  There was some on site parking, not sure of the cost, but it seemed to be chaotic on the way out, you exit onto Lake Shore, so it is very busy. There were a few taxi's and rickshaws waiting directly at the entrance, but if you order a taxi, they are supposed to pick you up on Lakeshore. Make sure you confirm with the taxi company/uber exactly where they are going to pick you up, it took 10 minutes to find mine. I much preferred this venue to any other I have attended, just because it was a smaller crowd and had a great view of the stage."

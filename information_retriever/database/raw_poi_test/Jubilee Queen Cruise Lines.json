It would be nice to have someone to have a minute in the beginning and to make people comfortable by giving them an introduction."

However, the boat left a few minutes late and could not  get close enough to view the air show. We were forced to go around center island which took a good 45 minutes and so a fair amount of the show was missed. In addition, on this boat there is very little outdoor space so people clustered around windows and railings so not ideal for viewing the show."

Some from our area were directed down far set of stairs and the rest took the opposite set...this created two lineups in essence where one line had to try to merge into the other line at a bottleneck...I think the original plan to do it by tables would have been the answer. it was a great cruise and the staff work hard...would do it again!"

Had a few fly-bys from the planes. There was crowding to share with other patrons to get good viewing spots due to light rain. The overall experience of the show was poor not satisfactory to possible water restrictions and long distance away of centre stage (at the CNE). Missed one of the acts. Unless you have proper video equipment (a zoom lens or binoculars) for viewing air show was bit disappointing. Not recommended for very young or disabled."

The bartender was good too I should add!",

The boarding gangway did not work, so elderly mothers with canes were navigating across slippery decks; and the owner announced the onboard generator was not working well, thus, no music and limited lighting  during the cruise. The worst was to be told there was no running water, so if we \"had to go #1 could the entire family go together as a group and only flush once and if we had to #2 to announce it to a crew member so they could manually flush the facility afterwards and to use hand sanitizer because there was no running water.\"  (we were all left wondering how the crew handling food were cleaning their hands!) It was a drab, boring, soundless, cold, dull cruise. They should have cancelled the cruise rather than ruin it for the 90 passengers identified by the owner!  I would never take this cruise again."

Take a water taxi\".....well the boat waited for people and didn't leave till past 7:30.  Not a big problem but when you've come from out of town and made it on time it is annoying to sit and wait for people who can't get there for the (supposedly) 7 p.m. departure.  Considering we left late we thought they'd keep us out on the water to make up for it, but we actually got back early after just tooting around not really going anywhere.  Disappointing.  The food was good but the way they call the table areas to the buffet was very disorganized so we just went up when we wanted.  We did have a good time, though but I doubt we'd do it again."

So you the customer might be out of luck with the dinner you paid for if you were at the end of the line. I couldn't believe I was hearing while this part was being explained to me.

        "Last night my family and I ended up on the Jubilee Queen. It was an end of summer thing before we get into the busy things of fall like school. It was supposed to be a fun filled entertaining evening. Due to deficiencies in the service, it was less than that.",
        " ",
        "My biggest complaint is the level of service. I have worked in the service industry for most of my adult life. The fails started at embarkation. The crew couldn't seem to get themselves organised just for the boarding process. It was slow with many trips back and forth between ship and dock  by the crew handling embarkation.",
        "We gave our name and were directed to our picnic table. Two bench seats pressed close together and bolted to the floor with little room on either side. This was done to squeeze as many bodies as possible into a limited space.I'm a bigger guy, and found the seating a little uncomfortable.",
        "That was nothing compared to the horror I saw visited on other people. Other people who were much bigger than I am were also forced to try and squeeze into these terrible benches. All of this when the crew could have made adjustments to their seating charts, since all seating is preassigned, to accommodate these bigger people smoothly and without drama by sending them to the more comfortable seating on the upper deck. Instead these people were forced into these tiny benches. ",
        "So we sat at our bench. We noticed a couple tables had received bar service so we tried to catch the eye of either of the servers moving around. We even called out to the one serving the table next to us. She apparently didn't hear us. It would be 2 hours and 51 minutes into the cruise before a server would stop at our table to ask if we wanted anything. I'd already made a trip to the bar myself so we declined. ",
        "So let's talk about the food. The food was actually tasty. It was hot were it was supposed to be and the salads were cold like they are supposed to be.. It was served cafeteria style. So the crew offered you each of the selections you could accept or decline. The portions they placed onto the paper plates were generous. You were allowed to go for seconds after everyone had had a first run through. We found that after our first plate we were filled. The only negative was food was not served until 8:30 at night. So if you are planning to do this dinner cruise eat a very late lunch. ",
        "The servers need training in how to serve. The servers need to understand that servers should engage with the guests. The servers didn't really seem to care whether we were there or not. When a bartender asks \"Have you made up your mind yet?\"  that after 30 seconds at the bar. You know some training is needed. ",
        "Hair should be neatly tied back. I don't want your hair hanging in my food.  Reaching in front of a guest without a word is rude and wrong. Taking a glass or plate without enquiring if the guest is done with it is also wrong. Yet this was the modus operendi of the servers on the ship. ",
        "After dinner we noticed that the ship was pretty much in the same area we had been in for the last hour. For the entire cruise we travelled Toronto Harbour between Queens Quay and The Docks over on Cherry St. the same loop over and over. ",
        "We noticed other cruises departing the harbour  through the eastern channel and the western gap and returning . This was kinda what I expected with this cruise. I had earlier noticed the Jubilee Queen during the day exploring Toronto Island and voyaging through more of the harbour, so we were a little disappointed.",
        "The sound system could use some tweaks. The DJ was pretty much unintelligible over the PA. The music had a fuzzy quality to it like some of the speaker cones were blown.",
        " ",
        "One other thing I found awkward is that being on the main deck all of the interior lights were brightly lit so that the view out the windows was kind of difficult. Perhaps a dimmer for after dinner would enhance the ambience. ",
        "The last thing I would mention: Uniform the word means same. I would like to suggest that this be applied to the crew. During our cruise everyone except the bartender had the white shirts with epaulettes, but the pants varied from person to person. Jeggings, tight leggings, untucked shirts etc.. some uniformity of dress would ensure a more professional appearance."

Firstly, they willfully misrepresent their price on Groupon advertising a 52% discount and claiming the regular price is $79.99 and that they are offering $42 tickets. Their regular price is $58.95 plus a harbour fee plus tax. The deal they are offering is $42 plus that same harbour fee plus tax. The total after tax and fees for the regular price is $79.99 and the total for the deal after tax and fees is $58.95. It's still a discount but I believe they are being purposely misleading about it.

She told me they would get corn chips for her and that they serve chicken skewers with mango sauce, beef sliders, cheeses, and that I should go to their website and check the menu because she can't pronounce the other items. The online menu confirmed what I was told and included Spanakopita, coffee/tea pastries. It also boasts about having the best cuisine on the harbour for the refined palate..",
        "When we arrived they served us cold Jamaican beef patties, eggrolls, samosa and jalapeno poppers. All of items were stone cold and in the case of the jalapeno poppers completely uncooked. These items are all things that are generally enjoyed warm and cooked and none of them were on the menu advertised. It appeared that they bought a bunch of these things at Costco in the frozen section and instead of heating them just let them thaw.  The servers made many excuses like they were told is was a room temperature menu and that nothing should be heated, that they didn't know about the online menu or what is said. The one girl who had described the menu to me on the phone before booking said that there is a disclaimer that the chef has the right to change the menu (there isn't a disclaimer or even a chef for that matter, they just dumped previously frozen food on a platter). It all was very disgusting and not even close to a suitable replacement for the nice sounding items on the menu.",
        "They gave us drinks and apologised and we tried to enjoy our evening.  However a little while later for no reason at all one server accosted me in the bathroom hallway and said \"I hear you had an issue with the food\". I said \"yes, it was terrible\" and she insisted that I listen to her and that the foods were cooked earlier and weren't supposed to be served warm. After arguing for a minute I asked her to walk away,  said: I didn't want to discuss it,  she is the one who came up to me, I wasn't trying to complain further, I just was trying to enjoy the evening, and please leave me alone. She put her foot in the bathroom doorway to block me from leaving or using the bathroom and said \"look at you, you are drunk, I should have you kicked off the boat\" (I wasn't drunk I had had 3 drinks and I was being harassed by her). I just kept yelling please leave me alone and finally she did. After that another staff came by and gave us like 30 free drink tickets and apologised. The drinks did not help forget that the company purposely misleads guest about their menu, that they literally don't care what they serve us (I am not even sure eating raw jalapeno poppers is food safe-- not that I tried it), and that they think we can be bullied into accepting it. Also I think it violates responsible alcohol serving standards to just throw 30 drink tickets to us (after calling me drunk no less). Finally their boat is decrepit and falling a part and smells like a sewer.",

        "We took the cruise on Oct 09, 2016 made a reservation online, when we showed up our name was not on the list. They assigned us table 9 and told us it is by the window, but it was not, they moved us to table 2 then moved us again to table 1. Ten minutes later a big man asked us to move again because the table is reserved, we told him we have been moved 3 times, so he started yelling at us \"I am the owner of the ship, if I ask you to move you move or I will ask you to leave the ship\" so we asked for a refund, but he walked away. Then he came back and repeated his threats. The activity is pleasant beautiful scenery of the Toronto Island, no audio guide or commentator, lunch was reasonable, apart from the owner's lack of hospitality and rude comments the staff is friendly."

        "Cruise itself was okay but the food was very disappointing. We went expecting dinner (this is why we paid extra for the evening cruise) and got slidders, bruschetta and little phylo pastries.......we left hungry and disappointed! I am not a hard liquor drinker and asked first if they had coolers but was told that even though they are on the drink menu the don't carry them. However the wine spritzer was really good.We boarded late and had to wait over an hour for a couple of stragglers which seemed odd to me that they would wait. Decor was quite nice staff was friendly and the view of Toronto was beautiful but we seemed to cruise back and forth. Glad we got a deal from Wagjag other wise paying full price would have made it a disaster but be aware they tac on lots of extra charges when you book the cruise."

        "I went with a group of people a year ago aboard the Jubilee Queen for a dinner cruise around Toronto Island and we decided to go again.",
        "This time we had a group of 20 and it was an amazing evening. The weather was perfect and the sunset outlined a beautiful city skyline. The food was delicious and the waitstaff very friendly. The music was a good mix of tunes and everyone had an amazing time! It was a first Toronto Harbour cruise for many that attended this time around. We're still talking about it. We'll have to do this again!! Thank you to the crew and staff aboard the Jubilee Queen in our celebration of friends!"

        "People were tripping over carpets. The boat stayed mainly in the west & did not go through the islands like in past. The cruise was advertised that it ended at 11, but it reality it was 10:30 when we docked so people started leaving then & had to be off the boat by 11 pm."

        "My two sisters and I went on the Jubilee Dinner Cruise. The weather was warm and sunny. The staff were friendly and helpful. The cruise was advertised as a dinner-dance with top 40's music. On that night there was a family party going on, and all the family members wore red and white outfits. They were a lovely family and all of them enjoyed the dance floor. I found the music was not really top 40's but was typically, more specific to the interests of this family, although it was a public cruise. ",
        "I would have enjoyed more of a range of popular music. ",
        "The dinner menu was pasta salad, cannelloni, bread rolls, chicken and a green salad. I follow a low carbohydrate diet and would have appreciated a little more variety with the salad, vegetables or meats. ",

The weather was wet and cool, but with the Jubilee Queen fully enclosed and well heated, the weather was not a factor. The meal was good and the entertainment (a DJ and a sax player) was great! Looking forward to booking again for next New Years!"

        "On October the 6th my girlfriend,now fiancee, family and I enjoyed a wonderful dinner cruise on the Jubilee Queen.The experience is one I won't forget. The food was excellent but most of all the Staff was amazing. I surprised my girlfriend by proposing to her while we danced to our favourite song \"This Is Why I Love You\"by Major.I asked the DJ if he could play this song,but he didn't have it. He searched online and got the song for me in less the 2 minutes, which I really appreciated. After proposing on the dance floor we returned to our seats and to our surprise the Staff brought over a bottle of Monet Champagne, congratulated us and didn't charge us for it. Also the Bartender brought over two shots of Tequila at no charge as well and congratulated us. All in all it was a beautiful night and I highly recommend to anyone that you will not be disappointed by chosing the Jubilee Queen. Thanks to the Staff for a wonderful experience. My fiancee and I look forward to enjoying another dinner cruise in the future.",

        "We did a dinner cruise last year on the Yankee Lady from Toronto Harbor . This year we picked the Jubelee Queen . This boat is different from Yankee Lady .

Ounce we set out crew announced our itinerary , meal time & how we would get our meal . There was a diverse age group on this cruise , Which made it a fun night . After dinner music & dancing started in upper deck . DJ was good & played request . We met fun people & had a great time . Both Yankee Lady &Jubelee Queen are on Wagjag for a good Deal"

        "It was my first time on a dinner cruise and I enjoyed myself. The boat had 3 levels, drinks were average price (6-7 bucks) and the food was O-K. I decided to give 3 stars because I don't think it was worth the price, I mean I was lucky enough to purchase mine on groupon but in all I saved 20 bucks. The food is buffet style and was mediocre. All in all I had a good time for my friend's birthday party. I would like to check out the other dinner cruises to be able to give a great comparison."

Enjoyed the music and the DJ was very happy to TAKE REQUESTS! Few customers weren't happy with all music selections, but I don't think these people knew that they could request songs. I suggest the staff inform customers of this, that would be my only suggestion. Thanks for a great experience.",
        "Also, for those looking for a fun winter activity: this is one of the few cruise ships that run 'til the very end of the season.  They were equipped with a pretty awesome heater, the dance floor was closed off with plastic, which allowed for a warm and beautiful view of Toronto from the water. The food was great and warm, and there was also unlimited tea and coffee served at the end of the cruise. Another suggestion: HOT CHOCOLATE would be great for this venue. I overheard that there is new management and that there are a lot of changes taking place upon this ship. We got to see this for ourselves and it was exciting to be a part of it. ",

However, do not expect any fancy ambiance, service, and utensils/plates. The music was nice. The scenery was beautiful. Food was\"ok\"! Some guests didn't get to eat what they wanted to eat because they were at the end of the line. "

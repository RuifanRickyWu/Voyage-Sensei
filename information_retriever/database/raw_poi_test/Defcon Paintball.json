        "Very friendly and professional staff. Equipment did not disappoint. Look for half price deals a few weeknight evenings and all holiday Mondays. The commando package is a very good deal. I would say their own specials even beat groupon deals so do the math before you book. The \"paint\" washes out easily. The entrance is a bit hard to find - you pass it on a \"dip\" on the drive along the building - parking is behind the building so you walk back to the small door with the sign on top."

Ensure you purchase the right birthday package - if that's possible - and here's why - Defcon offers 100 paintballs/ per person for the entire duration - however when you're already there they tell you it will hardly last 15 minutes - so what choice do you have but buy extra ammunition, which is expensive at $125 for 1000.",
        "All in all - great experience - I'd only suggest that Defcon improves its advertised birthday party packages - as they lack proper arrangements.",

Went through proper training and played about 2 hours straight.  The arena is bright enough and plenty of covers to hide in.  I do, however, agree that the refs should be enforcing the rules closely during the matches.  I got shot at couple of times within 5 feet as well as getting tattooed multiple times despite raising my hands.  ",

That's what the refs are for though, right? Wrong. The referees here are complete idiots. I tagged one guy six times, right in front of the ref, before I had to yell at the ref to get him out of the game for cheating. One time I was tagged, and I raised my arms to signal that I was out. I turned my back to go back to my side of the field, and was hit like 10 more times in the back. I looked at the ref, who would not say anything, as I was still being tagged while my hands were up. I had to walk over to the other team, and explain that you should not shoot somebody with their hands up, because this means they are out. This is common knowledge. An opposing team of incompetents and an idiotic ref do not make for a good experience.",

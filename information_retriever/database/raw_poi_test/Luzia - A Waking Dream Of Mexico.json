        "I kept on saying for years that I want to go and see CDS. So finally, this year, afara a friend suggested it, because he heard from another friend that the show was great, I decided to spare £100 and finally go and see the magic of CDS. But oh boy, what a big big disappointment. The acrobatic was not exactly jaw dropping, not to mention the number of mistakes /accidents that we unfortunately witnessed and the pantomime show was definitely something I would have liked not to be included in this performance. I mean, when you pay a lot of money for a show, you cannot help yourself to not have great expectations. I mean, a bit more action. I still think CDC deserves its respect for its contribution to the artistic industry, but this show is really disappointing. If I would have bothered to research more about the show, I would have definitely saved myself now £100."

        "Having said all of that, I still obviously have great respect for the performers as it's still an incredible skill - even those who faulted, but it needs to be a tad more bold."

        "We went to Luzia in the Royal Albert Hall in London. I visited many CDS shows and this was really the worst one. The majority of the time is spent on stupid jokes and the guy with the whistle who’s meant to be entertaining but he did such a poor job that only one kid among thousands of visitors was laughing the majority of the time. A lot of time is spent on cleaning and their materials are not used in the best way. They used the water a lot but actually the majority of the scenes didn’t include it yet it took so much time to clean it up, and that time was filled with weird jokes. ",
        "Each show scene was very long with few exceptionally hard tricks, but for a 7-10 minute turn it’s too little. ",
        "The jiggling guy did a poor job too. In fact he was only jiggling up to 4 sticks at a time what is average for the industry and when he got the 5-7th ones, he just through them in the air once and than caught them. So it wasn’t really jiggling, it was just throwing stuff in the air in order and then catching it in said order. ",
        "The last episode with the swings was also not impressive. At difficult acrobatic technics the receiving swing was paused so that the gymnast would 100% land on it, but what’s the point of the swings then, if at the end the gymnast lands not on the swing that is moving but on a concrete and solid thing. Very, very disappointing. Paid £114 per person and didn’t really get the show that I was expecting."

We saw ovo and that was amazing which is why we went again. This show didn't have as many wow moments and the content was limited. Too much of the guy whistling and too many simple things like juggling and football skills. Also the water used in the acts meant there was a lot of time wasted cleaning up. It was ok but not really worth the £94 paid for the ticket. Merchandise was also over priced."

Going in not sure what to expect and came out in disbelief by how wonderful it was. Currently id say this is one of the best things to do in Toronto. I would definitely go see this again. Very intimate seating for everyone (although try to get centre seats). It also features the top contortionist in the world and some other amazing and talented performers. The end of the performance left me with chills. Definitely a 5/5, 10/10, A+ experience!"

It rained, and even the restrooms are outside, unless you are a a 100% clear skies, it could ruis an evening. Once inside, we had front row seats, to the sides, and the stage props obstructs a good chuck of the performance, (they should have thought of this), specially during the clown's appearance, which is often, and among the best parts. If you have ever seen any of their shows, this will fall so far bellow expectations. do not spend more than $65-$75, AND any-seat-at that price will be provide equally good viewing. it is a good show, for someone who has never seen their indoor shows."

The contortionist will make you squirm but honestly you cannot stop watching him. Every aspect of the show left us in awe. I absolutely recommend it. Even though I gave it a 5 rating I do have to admit that the seating was the worst I have ever experienced. While the location of our seats were perfect, they were very small and I was pressed against the people on both my right and left. I was in physical pain for most of the show. The seats would be perfect for small children but for adults they are not adequate, especially. I was in between two bigger guys and I am not small my self. I noticed people of average weight having the same problem, being squished together. Even with the bad seating situation and physical pain, I still recommend seeing the show."

I went to the show in Atlanta where they are performing from September through November. It's the 3rd shows I attended in a tent which is always the best venue to experience a circus. In Luzia, each performance was well connected smoothly. I loved the music and the Spanish songs. The water element and acrobatic complexity on stage were astonishing. The master and all performers did a fantastic job on stage as well as interaction with the audiences. I recommended it to my friends and colleagues. Kudos to all performers and workers behind the scene. They made it happened."

At this point, I only see Cirque shows in the tent because I've realized the caliber of the show is significantly better when in a tent. Now, I must be honest: Luzia was one of my least favorite shows I've seen, despite it being in a tent. Whelp, there goes my theory. Perhaps we should've waited longer to see the show; it was only the show's second night in Seattle. Everything about this show did not live up to my expectations. In addition, the last, and arguably biggest, scene was a complete dud and the performers stopped a quarter of the way through and just stood there until there was an announcement that the show was temporarily paused. I heard a performer was injured the night before but I don't see why that act couldn't run smoothly the following night. ",

        "The theater was HOT (as in temperature). It was a relief when the show was over to go back outside and cool off. The seats were very narrow with very little leg room (the seats must have been designed for kids in mind vs. adults). Everyone's' shoulders were touching. Your legs were almost touching the seats in front of you. All this distracted me from watching most of the show. At intermission, all of the bathroom were long. I over heard many people saying \"I don't need to go that bad\" after seeing how long the line ups were. More bathrooms were needed for the volume of people.",
        "From the parts of the show I was able to watch, it was alright. It was not the best Cirque Du Soleil I've seen (not even close). There was no plot what so ever and it seemed to be all random.",
        "I was not impressed."

        "I went last night and the show was just...ok. The acrobats were amazing and the production was great but it seemed like the same thing was happening over and over and over again. We ended up leaving early because it was kinda repetitive and I've honestly seen better shows than this one. They tried to add comedy here and there. I may have have chuckled just to be nice but it just wasn't my style of comedy. I probably wouldn't go back but it's nice for a family outing or date night."

        "My husband has been to a few shows, only one other myself, and we love going to their traveling tent, it makes the experience so much more magical. ",
        "The restrooms are great for port-a-potties but would be terrible in bad weather, thankfully our day was beautiful. Make sure to bring lots of extra money for concessions ($8 cotton candy but free refills on popcorn) and gift shop, but there are many options and the staff is very helpful if something doesn't work after buying!",
        "All seats will have a good view because of the tent structure, but we like side of stage front of second section for best appreciation without being too close. ",
        "Cast members are always going around to include you in the magic and our three girls loved everything from start to finish! While there just let yourself go and be amazed.",
        "Pro tip - after buying a $6 water we found the water bubbler near a side entrance that the cast members use between acts. We were able to refill cool water during the show to save a bit, so arrive early to stalk out the tent!"

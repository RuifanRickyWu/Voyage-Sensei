They were so responsive and willing to work with us so we could take the tour! The entire process of booking the tour was so accommodating and that really spoke highly how much they care. On the day of our tour, we met Heather in Union Station and she took us all around the cool places. She had a lot of great info and was very funny. We loved our private tour and would highly recommend it to any and everyone. It was the perfect combo of Drake info and info about the city! Thanks!!"

I do think it could have been more Drake-focused, but there were certainly a lot of fun facts incorporated in the tour."

Tours of the 6 was so fun and informative and its like I got to see a city I know and love for the very first time!  The tour takes you through 2.5 hours of fun filled facts and side streets of Toronto's rich history.  This tour is for everyone, even if you are not a Drake fan.  I would highly recommend this tour to both Torontonians and visitors alike.  Cannot recommend enough, the tour guides are full of energy and passionate about showcasing the best that Toronto has to offer. Go on this tour."

Overall, I would recommend this tour to people sightseeing in Toronto, people who live here or even anyone who just simply likes Drake."

As someone who has been on other walking tours around the world, I would highly recommend this for all types of travelers visiting Toronto, even if you are unfamiliar with Drake. Our tour guide, Stephanie was amazing - she was full of energy and very passionate about her job. She mentioned that the tour company is made up of enthusiastic, avid travelers who wanted to start high quality walking tours in Toronto, like you would see in many other cities around the world. Surprisingly, there aren't many offered in \"The 6\" - and this tour is a great way get started! We had lots of fun on our path, which starts at Union Station and ends at Queen & Spadina. The tour opened our eyes to so many new hot spots and we learned interesting facts about our city that we didn't otherwise know as locals (the ACC used to be the Canada Post, who knew?!). Kudos to Tours of the 6 for putting together something that both locals and travelers from around the world can fully appreciate."

I was a bit hesitant as i'm not a big Drake fun but my husband is so we gave it a shot and it was equally entertaining for both of us. The tour offered a different perspective on the city, the inside scoop on restaurants and go-to spots all while listening to a boombox and walking with some \"friends\". The time flew by and we were both really happy with the experience. Definitely recommend to people who live in and around Toronto as well as all visitors. Drake fan or not, this tour has something to offer everyone. PS wear comfortable shoes and bring your cameras - some really beautiful photo ops!"

Though the tour is based around Drake I would recommend it to anyone. We walked around the major parts of the city and it was amazing how excited they were about the place. We went to parts of the city I would have never thought to go and they had interesting facts about all the places. They had extensive knowledge and tips on everything from where to get the best view of the city to where to hang out in the evenings. They also showed me the best cookie place in Toronto! "

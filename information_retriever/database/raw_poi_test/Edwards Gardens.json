On weekends it does get crowded with families enjoying an outing and wedding parties taking photos. Best to go during the week or early morning. You can enjoy these scenic gardens during any season but fall presents a wonderful display of colors. Admission is free and there is a minimal parking fee."

The valley portion is very natural and pretty while the more studied, planned and tamed upper is designed to impress. Lovely shop for gardeners and gifters, a pleasant water feature, and an event space which seems often to host weddings, makes it a popular spot. Check it out.....  "

        "I feel a little embarassed by Edwards Gardens because they are waiting for Toronto Botanical Garden to fix the broken patio, bridge, and other crumbling areas when they have money.  Toronto Botanical Gardens fought for management control of this place, and got it in 2018, and then first thing they did (after making their vision plan) was to charge parking fees.  I think Rupert Edwards would turn in his grave if he knew, because he sold it to Metro Parks on the condition that there would never be any fees charged to enter his former estate.  I'm so disappointed in the city's decision to allow the TBG to do this to the public.  Otherwise, this is a beautiful park, full of memories for me and my family and friends, I go there almost every week in every season to walk."

From music in the park to varying floral displays and simply opportunities to sit, meditate and watch the birds and squirrels, this has been our go to place for peace and quiet.   Unfortunately, our politicians have expanded the  shameful policy of charging visitors to park if they wish to enjoy this part of the wonderful Toronto parks system.   As they did with the Brickworks, access to these public places has been placed in the hands of affluent volunteers who give of their time and expertise but have introduced a relatively expensive parking system which penalizes those who make frequent visits to the parks or wish to linger for longer walks along the trails.   I do not believe that visits to any public parks should come with a price tag.   I anticipate the outcry when Councillors approve parking fees for High Park."

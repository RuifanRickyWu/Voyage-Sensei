I feel the price is high for what you get, at the end I regretted not renting a car and doing everything on my own, but of course, having all planned is more relaxing. Everything was right on schedule, I would suggest leaving more time on Niagara on the Lake for free lunch, vs waiting 2 hours on the stop at the Niagara center because if you don't have lunch with the group, there is not a lot of food, and the only other option is fast-food. More time on Niagara on the Lake and time for lunch there would allow everyone to enjoy the town, its restaurants, coffee and ice-cream shops."

        "This was a fantastic tour!  The tour guide, Danielle was superb, and Apollo, the driver, did a great job navigating all the traffic.  Niagara Falls was spectacular!  Danielle had everything set up and helped to navigate the process.  Lunch was one of the many highlights since our table over looked horseshoe falls, so beautiful, and the cod lunch was very delicious.  A few stops after the falls then came back; traffic was not pleasant.  The van was comfortable and picked up/dropped off us up at the hotel.  If you are in Toronto and want a special tour to Niagara Falls, then this is the tour for you.  You won’t be disappointed.  Yes, you will get wet but that is part of the experience."

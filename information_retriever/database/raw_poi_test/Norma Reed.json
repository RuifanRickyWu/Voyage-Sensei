        "Unfortunately our experience was not great at Oshawa or Fairview.  There were a couple of staff at each place who seemed like they wanted to help, but they were the greeters or the ones putting dresses away.  The ones taking care of the change rooms were rude, miserable and only seemed to care about selling a dress.  The one dress we tried on in Oshawa stunk like body odour - very badly.  When we went to Fairview and tried on the same dress, we also found out it had an extra piece that was missing on the dress in Oshawa.  Zero disclosure  - just want to sell the dress.  Also, if you are anything other than a perfect size 2, then don't expect a good selection.  The girl ahead of us left with her dad stating 'i swear if they tell me I have to \"size up\" one more time.....'.  They also did that to us.  No offer to grab another dress - see if there is another size.  Just a rude, impatient \"you're gonna have to size up\".  Don't waste your time or energy going to either of these money hungry zero customer service stores.  Spend your hard earned money somewhere else."

        "Disappointing service - WILL NOT SHOP HERE AGAIN NOR RECOMMEND!!  I was looking for a dress for my daughter's wedding. I found one but it was not my size. Jesse in the Oshawa store assured me they could alter the dress and insert a corset backing for me. I was hesitant but trusted her knowledge and experience that the dress would fit. Alterations were to be complete on September 6th (wedding was Sept 19th). I received a call on the 5th asking for another week to perform the alterations - they wanted to ensure they did a good job!  I arrived at the store on the 12th but the dress was not ready yet. Received a call on the 13th the dress was ready but the shawl would be in the next day. I arrived at the store on the 15th and the dress didn't fit!!! The corset strap was too short, the sides were not let out and panels were not put in - which resulted in the straps coming out of my arm pits (many other small disappointing points but these were the big ones). This was my last day to pick up the dress.  They would not issue a refund!  They assured me they would make further alterations and then deliver to my home on Thursday evening.  BUT - The dress still didn't fit! the straps didn't stay up and still didn't align properly (coming out of my arm pits still) and the bust line was WAY too low (still). Sides were not let out and side panels were not inserted.  The corset piece barely covered my back!  I wore a sweater over the dress all day but felt very uncomfortable. VERY DISAPPOINTING for paying over $500.00!!!  Was offered a free costume jewelry necklace for my trouble!  WILL NOT SHOP HERE AGAIN NOR RECOMMEND!!"

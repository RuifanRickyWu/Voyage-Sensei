  "description": "Etobicoke is a relaxed area along the Humber River. It's saturated with green spaces and conservatories, making it a premier destination for outdoor sports, hiking, and nature walks. Its abundance of parkland and lakes makes it a typical spot for fishing, picnicking, and camping out, especially in warmer months. The peaceful area is also enjoyed by families, who appreciate its boardwalks and sports facilities. Locals enjoy the variety of golfing and country club opportunities, which also provide lessons for golfers of any skill level.",

        "I purchased a ticket for $48.25 to bring my 4 year old to experience the Anime North event yesterday. We had to take an uber over with a baby carseat since we currently haven't bought a new car yet since we got rid of the old one. We arrived to find hundreds people crowding outside all around the building. People were everywhere with seemingly no organization at all. It was quite a mess. We ended up walking around carrying a heavy carseat and the baby talking to at least 10 different staff members over the course of 45 minutes in an attempt to figure out where I could potentially stow the car seat so that I wouldn't have to carry it everywhere with me during the event. Unfortunately, no one seemed to care at all and was not able to help us find a place to put the car seat, and eventually, we were ultimately forced to leave and not attend the event. I was surprised that there was nowhere to check in personal items like this, or that there was no storage place somewhere to hold the car seat temporarily for a couple of hours. This is the only venue out of many that I've brought my boy to over the years that didn't have any way to help with stowing or checking in some personal items temporarily. I've been to events with over 40k people in attendance and all of them have ways to accommodate checking in of personal items. Needless to say, I am not happy with my experience yesterday at all. Reached out to the organizers but was not offered any refund. I would not recommend Anime North to people with young children as it is not family-friendly at all. Personally, I will never attend this event again in the future."

Pretty much no vegan or even healthy food options around the TCC, I managed to find a veg wrap across the road at the International Plaza. Outside looked like a construction zone, not convention grounds. There were fenced off areas using portable fences propped up on 2x4's that stuck out into high traffic pedestrian areas. I tripped more than once. Huge potholes in the parking lot that I saw quite a few people tripping in. Lucky nobody twisted an ankle considering many were walking around with obstructed vision due to costumes. The area where we were to line up for entrance to the concerts had machines and equipment piled up from tarring the roof. Really, they decide to do this the week of a huge convention? Made the entrance for the concerts hard to find, and just looked really trashy. Must have given a great impression to the bands who travelled very far to perform here.",

        "There are several reviews here that mirror many of the good things I \"would\" write, but I don't need to since they did it so well. ",
        "Like many other people, we bought the trip on Groupon and could not believe the price. China was not a bucket list destination for either of us, but the price was right and the timing is right, so off to China we went.",
        "Overall the customer service was great and they kept us posted along the way about all of the details and everything we would need for the trip.",
        "The flight on China Eastern Airlines was fine (ours left from JFK), and the hotels were better than one would ever expect. These were true five-star hotels in every sense of the word.",
        "We did opt to purchase the additional tours rather than doing other things on our own. With the low price did come having to visit state owned shops that sold pearls, jade, silk, and tea, but they were fun to see, the people were nice, and you could buy something if you wanted to and didn't have to if you didn't want to.",
        "But the trips to the major attractions like the Great Wall, Summer Palace, Forbidden City, Tiananmen Square, Temple of Heaven, West Lake, and so many others was well worth it. And the Peking duck dinner we had on Thanksgiving night was unbelievable. There was also off time that we could do anything we wanted and eat REAL Chinese foods rather than what we were served on the tours.",
        "The tour guides were amazing and informative and flexible, and we could not rave about them enough. They were happy to go off schedule and take us somewhere we wanted to go and arrange travel for people who want to go other places like Disney or back to the \"imposter market.\"",
        "They arranged for us to do the Skywalk at the Jin Mao Tower (definitely not on their itinerary!). ",
        "Overall, do not let the low price scare you and enjoy China. As a bonus, you'll end up with 10-year visa so you can go back again if you like"

        "This trip was our honeymoon, we thought a big adventure would be a great choice to celebrate our marriage.  Right from the get go, we had some issues.  Air China is HORRIBLE to spend a 14 hour flight with.  Uncomfortable, cramped, and dirty airplane.  Food awful.  ",
        "The rest of the trip was mostly spent on a tour bus, shuttling from one location to another where government employees spent hours making sales pitches and trapped you on a sales floor hounding you to buy their items.  Don't be fooled - the \"tours\" of jade, pearl, tea, etc are like a timeshare presentation.  The actual highlights such as the great wall, buddha, and others are rushed and you never feel like you got to really see the place.  Tour guides are very reluctant to give you any time on your own.  We convinced them to allow us out of the hotel to take the subway around town and do some sightseeing on our own on a couple of evenings, but for the most part you will only see the inside of the hotel, the inside of the bus, and the inside of a bunch of government shops.  Lunches included with the tour are all at the government shops as well, with bland Americanized versions of Chinese food.  If you want real Chinese cuisine, you'll have to sneak off at night and go find some.  ",
        "The hotels are okay, some are better than others.  At worst, one was dirty and reeked of cigarette smoke. ",
        "Every moment of the day is crammed with the tour guide or the locals attempting to get you to buy something: an added tour, a product, an extra shuttle ride somewhere.  It's overwhelming to be constantly approached for more money when you've already paid to be there.  JUST. SAY. NO.",
        "On our way out, Air China in Beijing had every single person from our tour group's passport number wrong in the system, and we very nearly missed our flight back to the US.  There were a few moments where we were really afraid they would not allow us to leave.",
        "To be fair, it's an amazing price to get to China and stay in the hotels, but I would never do a guided tour or fly with Air China again."

        "Rewards Travel China provided a very good tour covering many of the top attractions.  We purchased our tour through a Groupon voucher, and were very pleased with the value.  We travelled at the end of November through the beginning of December, which is the off season.  This made the attractions less crowded, and traffic lighter.  Our tour began in Beijing with tour guide Alice.  Alice was very organized and gave good historical information.  Alice used small remote earphone receivers for the members of the tour, which I really appreciated, especially after seeing other tour groups using loudspeakers, or just yelling at their groups.  I was able to hear all the information she shared clearly, and it wasn’t loud and obnoxious for the people around us.  While in Beijing, we joined the optional tours to the Forbidden City, Summer Palace, Temple of Heaven & Hutongs.  The add on tours were worth the cost, simply because your transportation is included, and you don’t have to wait in line & deal with the hassle for tickets.  My only disappointment of the Forbidden City tour is that we were not allowed to view any of the artifact galleries.  I understand time was limited, but even 30-45 minutes free time to explore those areas would have been nice. The Summer Palace was beautiful, and we were given plenty of free time to explore.  The Great Wall was a bucket list item, and we were given enough time to climb as much as we wanted to.  The next leg of the trip was Suzhou, Hangzhou, Wuxi and Shanghai.  We really enjoyed our guide, JoJo.  She was entertaining, shared lots of interesting facts and stories, and gave us fascinating insight to daily life in China.  JoJo allowed our group some free time to explore the attractions, which let each of us focus on the things we were most interested in.  JoJo showed us where to buy dumplings in Suzhou, which was absolutely the best food we ate the entire trip.    JoJo worked together with other RTC guides Sunny & Ivy, whose groups were on approximately the same itinerary.  This allowed us to mingle with their groups, and have transportation arranged for alternate sightseeing & shopping for those us not attending some of the add on shows or tours.  The bus drivers were phenomenal.  Everyone was amazed by their skill in negotiating the crazy traffic, and their ability to drive and park in the tightest areas.  Most of the group returned home from Shanghai, but we added on an extension trip to Xi’an to see the Terracotta Warriors.  This was well worth the cost.  When we arrived, we discovered our family of four had tour guide Julie and driver Mr. Young to ourselves.  Julie was excellent, explaining history and culture and answering our numerous questions.  She was a wealth of knowledge.  Julie went out of her way to take us to a local restaurant and order for lunch on our arrival.  She also worked late to help us find our way to the Muslim Quarter market on our last evening, which was the best shopping opportunity of the entire trip.  You need to be aware the tours include stops at government owned factories, which consist of a short educational sales pitch, then a longer time in a showroom where you may purchase those items.  Be aware that it is the trade off for getting such a good deal on the airfare, hotels and transportation.  If you don’t want to go these places and spend some of your time, then look for a travel agency that doesn’t include them and pay full retail price.  You won’t see the actual factory, or the actual pearl farm, but a worker or two demonstrating some part of the process.  You are not required to buy if you don’t want to.  The sales people are persistent, but will take no for an answer.  You will stay there until the last person is done shopping, so it feels like you are wasting precious time.  The best was the calligraphy school in Xi’an.  The teacher gave an excellent brief overview of Chinese language, and helped us learn how to write a character.  My least favorite was the Chinese medicine stop where the doctor used my pulse and looking at my eyes to diagnose me with high cholesterol and high blood pressure.  She prescribed a six month supply of herbs that would have run over $1000.  I had just recently had physical and labs done in the U.S., so knew my cholesterol and blood pressure were fine.  I do believe Chinese medicine can really help people, but it was clear this visit was all about making a sale.  The silk visit was disappointing, because we did not see the thread being spun, or any live silk worms prior to being shut in a room full of bedding for a second sales pitch. The craftsmanship at the jade & embroidery stops was amazing.  We did get to walk around the actual tea farm, which was beautiful, before the tea presentation.  The hotels were all quite nice, and the breakfast buffets had something for even the pickiest eaters.   The lunches were served family style with plenty of food aimed at American tastes.  Some were served in restaurants, others in large banquet rooms at the factories, which were not as good as the restaurants.  Tip:  at the more crowed tourist attractions, street vendors will approach with souvenirs like purses, scarves and chopsticks.  We found they would negotiate prices that were much better than any of the gift shops or market stalls on the exact same items.  If they are selling something you like, bargain for it, because you probably won’t find it cheaper elsewhere.  Overall, our Rewards Travel China trip was a great affordable way to experience China, and I would recommend their tours to anyone that would like to see a large amount in a short time."

        "The price was so low for a 10-day tour that I was expecting low quality. But no, our hotels were on par with the finest in the USA. The tours and shows were great, the bus was comfortable, the guides spoke English, the meals were great. We were pleasantly surprised and highly recommend Rewards Travel.",
        "The only negative is that you are required to go to certain places and they will threaten to cancel your flight home if you refuse. So don't get sick or injured. If you do you will need a doctor's note to be excused. They make their profit by bringing people to the jade factory, silk factory, etc. There is no pressure to buy anything but tourists spend thousands anyway, and most would choose to tour those fine factories even if it weren't required.",
        "Other info: the hotels all had 220V outlets compatible with USA style plugs and even 110V for shavers. US credit cards and currency are seldom accepted but we changed currency at the first hotel front desk. We had very little free time outside of tours but when we did we enjoyed the subway system and felt very safe. China is a very modern country and I think the standard of living there has surpassed many parts of Europe. The cities looked like and felt like American cities, except for the writing and beautiful Chinese historic buildings sprinkled in, and the fact that we never saw a homeless person. We did meet one polite panhandler, but since the government guarantees everyone a minimum income we declined to donate."

        "We've been fortunate enough to travel all over the world, and our tour guide JEFFREY was the absolute BEST!  He made our trip very enjoyable and went over and above his usual and customary job duties to ensure that all of us were content. Whatever issues or problems came up in the group, he immediately attempted to fix the situation. He also passed out goodies like various Chinese candies/treats, and made sure we all had enough water to stay hydrated. In addition he organized an evening of dinner with transportation, for a Chinese massage, using his own time, for several members of our group. Christine and I asked him many questions, (I'm sure he had been asked the same questions many times before!) and he was always happy to share his wisdom, and also his own experiences of his life in China. JEFFREY was the BEST!   From Greg"

Rewards Travel China provided a great itinerary with opportunities to either see more with additional guided excursions, or explore a bit on your own/ relax.  My wife speaks mandarin, so we opted to explore a bit on our own in many cases.",
        "I've seen other reviews saying that two of the \"must see\" excursions are the Shanghai river tour and the Forbidden City in Beijing, and I agree - both of those stops were totally worthwhile.",
        "My biggest concern going into the trip were what I had heard of the mandatory shopping stops.  I don't totally understand all of the background of these stops - I've heard some say they're government run, but I'm not sure that's true.  Either way, the sales pitch was generally very interesting, and I felt very little direct pressure to buy.  In fact, some stops we didn't buy anything as we weren't that interested, and felt no pressure about that.",
        "My tour guide on the Shanghai leg was Sen Xu - his partners were Frank and Cooper.  This was a great team who made the trip go very smoothly and found ways to make the trip extra special.  Thank you to the entire Rewards Travel China organization for making such an amazing trip for my wife and I!"

After three friends of mine went with the same RTC promotion last year and this year, I am more than happy that I finally booked it. I went with three other people, and we all had a wonderful time and excellent experience! The trip was highly structured/organized, fun, and well-worth it!  Five different cities with 5 star hotels and two provided meals, I am highly satisfied with the trip and incredible experience.",

Jade has a kind soul and was knowledgeable, professional, and gave us an excellent experience of Beijing.  We learned a lot about Chinese culture, history, and the locals also welcomed us with an open heart. Jade truly cared for us, and welcomed us into her extended family.",
        "Sen, Frank, and Leo also did an excellent job for the second half of our trip. Sen was our tour guide, and they all worked together as a team. Sen was professional, polite, and also has a kind soul and warm heart. He was knowledgeable, organized, and very patient with our group, considering the trip is highly structured and he did his best to accommodate everyone’s needs and personalities. We learned a lot about New China, and Shanghai was among the many highlights of this trip. Shanghai is the city of the future! Sen also truly cared for us and welcomed us into his extended family. Thank you Sen for being there for us every step of the way! ",

        "I have so many good things to say about my experience with Rewards Travel China (RTC) that I really don't know where to start. So let me start by saying that I have never done anything impulsive in my life but impulsively buying a Groupon for 10 days, to China, with this company. Original Groupon said that flights, hotels and two meals per day were included with transportation and an English-speaking tour guide. My husband and I saw the crazy low price of $599 per person and jumped on it. ",
        "Is the price for real? The price actually varies on departure location. Because we were leaving from Orlando, Florida the price actually went up to about $800 per person. Nevertheless, with everything included, the price was still too good to pass. Thus my husband and I went for the buy without never actually having planned to go to China or knowing anything about traveling to China. We didn't even know about the Traveling Visa (which you pay for separately and was definitely an expense we were not counting on) that you need to get in order to travel to China. Though Rewards Travel China DID disclose that the Visa expenses were to be paid separately, I really had no idea we would pay around (with all documents required) about almost $300 additionally per person for each individual visa. Again... the traveling visa is compulsory and has nothing to do with the traveling agency. Furthermore, although i know people that were actually able to buy the travel package for under $600 (most of the people I met departing form the West of USA), the trip is still pretty inexpensive since China's government sponsors the trip and provides amazing discounts to the company in exchange of including government funded tours (such as the Silk Factory, Jade Factory, among others). These are all places that when you travel to China, you want to go. Most of the places you will have to listen to the history of the facility and a 10-20 minute sales pitch. Buying is optional and in no way are people pressured to buy. I purchased items on limited places and had friends that didn't purchase anything at all. Finally, the history and sales pitch is not only interesting but funny as they make it very entertaining. ",
        "Meeting our tour guides. Arriving to China we followed our itinerary, passed through customs and were received by our Beijing tour guide, Peng Song aka Nick. Peng was very responsable, organized and always carried our itinerary with information. He was endearing, honest, genuine and very familiar with western culture. Peng was always available for us, was very approachable, genuine and accommodating. He was also very knowledgeable on the history and treated all of us as family. Peng had an answer to all of our questions, was patient and went above and beyond to make our experience enjoyable. After Beijing we took a four-hour bullet train to Shanghai and were greeted by Foresen, known as Sen, who was our tour guide for the rest of the days. Sen was hilarious, attentive and very approachable. Both tour guides were extremely special in their own way and both surpassed our expectations. They were very accommodating, dependable and in charge of a group of 33 people. We never had issues and both guides were always making sure we were constantly together.",
        "Optional tours: Initially, my husband and I had only booked some of the optional tours, though later decided to add them while in China. We ended up adding almost all of the additional optional tours since honestly, we didn't know anybody in China and wouldn't know were to go or what to do without a tour guide. I recommend adding most of the day tours with exception of two boat tours. The only boat tour that I would recommend is the boat tour in Suzhou (\"The Venice of the East\"), since it is inexpensive, the experience is worth it and you later get to walk around the town surrounding the river. The other boat tours you just get in the boat and do not see the surrounding areas. The boat tours at Shanghai and West Lake in Hangzhou I would not recommend since you get a better experience and view of the area on foot rather than by boat. ",
        "All in all the schedule is pretty tight which makes it difficult to fully taking in each location. Nevertheless, if you want to make most of your trip and see most of the \"must-see\" places in China, you GOT to have a tight itinerary. The itinerary is well thought of and the selected locations are amazing. Even the hotels are amazing and the lunch options are well picked. Finally, my husband and I fell in love with China and hope to visit again; we would totally coordinate everything with RTC if possible."

        "We recently did a 10 day tour of Beiing, Suzhou, Wuxi, Hangzhou and Shanghai with Rewards Travel China (RTC) with an additional \"3\" day extention (really 2) to Xi'an to see the Terra Cotta Soldiers.  The trip was quite a good value and well organized so would recommend the trip - with a few caveats - some that have been mentioned by other reviewers. Our trip coordinator Chloe did a great job of keeping us informed and updated with flight and tour information - there were necessary changes to flights and other scheduling issues and she was very quick to communicate, explain and provide very suitable alternatives.",
        "When we arrived 3 hours late in Beijing due to airline delays out of the control of RTC, we were promptly met by a driver and were transferred, along with some other travelers who arrived around the same time as us we were met by our guide, Nick and quickly checked in to the hotel and given a short itinerary for the next couple of days.  The next day was a free day when you could purchase an additional tour with RTC or be \"on our own\".  Here comes the first and second caveats: ",
        "1) the daily itineraries with the company, even the ones you pay extra for, mostly include stops at state run \"factories\" for things like jade, herbal medicine, silk, tea etc.  At these visits you are given a lesson about the subject - usually with a short demonstration (but there is no working factory) and then a fairly hard sell on products associated with the subject.  The quality ranges from very nice to trinkets and it is buyer beware/pay attention.  Not to say there aren't good deals, but you should know before you go.  These stops always include a clean restroom and a good chance to stretch your legs so weren't a bad thing.  We felt we learned something at every stop.  But, they did take away from time at historical/social sights; ",
        "2) hotels on this trip, with the exception of Xi'an are located FAR (1 hr at a minimum and 1.5 hrs or more at max.) from City Centers/Points of Interest, so during free time it is difficult to schedule alternative plans.  However, we did just that on our first free day as we did not want to spend some of our time at the sales sights right away.  We were fortunate to arrange a private tour with pickup at our remote hotel and had a great day seeing Forbidden City, Temple of Heaven and Summer Palace (see separate review) and returned to our hotel late afternoon for a good rest.  We had a full day of plans the next day as part of our tour and our guide Nick (Ponge) was fabulous, interpreting many sights along the way and explaining much about life in the City.  He was helpful at the sales locations but not over bearing and we really enjoyed our time with him and felt he added five star value to the trip.  *****",
        "The third day was supposedly more time on our own or we could add an excursion with the group  to an additional sales location as well as more sights.  Later that day we were to take a high speed train from Beijing to Suzhou.  A real negative to the trip for us was that there was very poor logistics for those of us who chose a day on our own. We were told we had to be back at the hotel at 12:30 (which prevented much sightseeing as hotel 1.5 ish hrs in rush hour from any of the sights - each way )- then we got on a bus at the hotel at 12:30, waited there for another almost hour on the bus, then drove into the city and sat on the bus for an additional almost 2 hrs to meet up with the group for transfer to the train station.  So basically that was a day completely lost. That was no fault of Nick's - was scheduling by the company and we just want to make sure everyone aware of how logistics work.",
        "Upon arrival in Suzhou, we met our next guide, Sen - who was very welcoming and helpful and got us checked in and got us our intineraries for the whirlwind next few days - we changed hotels each night for the next three nights and also had an additional guide with us at each city.  The company definitely kept us busy and seeing many different parts of the country.  The guides during this time period were good but did little interpretation of what we were seeing along some fairly long road trips - rather they really seemed focused on hyping whatever product/factory we were going to see next.  This really isn't a complaint but the trip could have been enhanced during this period.  All the hotels were very nice, the breakfasts got us a good start to our days and the lunches enjoyable though pre-determined (we had no choices).  Shanghai was a highlight for us - by virtue of its size and energy levels.  Wish we would have been more centrally located.  Because there were some late evening shows etc. that were add ons that we didn't select, there were some logistical issues with getting everyone back to the hotel when they wanted to be etc. but it all worked out ok in the long run.",
        "From there were transferred to Xi'an and were met by Ling who was another five star ***** guide.  She was personable, professional and very good at interpretation of the rich history of Xi'an and the Terracotta Warriors.  The hotel in Xi'an was centrally located, very spacious and accomodating.  So wish we would have had more time in this fascinating City - except air quality was pretty poor there the two days we were out and about.  Highly suggest everyone take masks for this possible occurence not only here but in the other cities as well.  ",
        "All in all a great value trip - it got us to China much sooner than we ever could have planned and are very glad we went.  The guides and drivers all worked hard, long hours coordinating a fairly large # of people (32 ish) Beijing - Shanghai - and a bit less in Xi-an.  The coordination was impressive and the trip one we will treasure."

        "My dad and I had a great time traveling with Rewards Travel China. Our host in Beijing, Alice, was great. She gave us all sorts of information about the places we were going and was well organized. She also took us on multiple shopping excursions which for me was fun.",
        "When we went to Suzhou, Hangzhou, and Shanghai we became part of Jeffrey’s family. He took care of us bringing snacks and water, toilet paper, and hand sanitizer. He also gave us tons of information about the sights we were seeing. Being in Jeffrey’s group made our visit to China special. He was laid back and happy and helped us all with special requests. We also got some shopping time with Jeffrey and he really helped us not feel pressured to buy anything which was cool because I had felt a little pressure at the beginning of the trip. Jeffrey really went above and beyond to make us comfortable and help us do what we wanted.",
        "At first I was skeptical to book a tour to China at such a low cost but I’m happy I did. The tour was well organized. Breakfast and lunch were included and the guides were all helpful when we asked about dinner recommendations. We were picked up from the airport and dropped off at the hotel. If we wanted to go out on our own Jeffrey helped us arrange taxis or other transportation. Most of the hotels were outside of the city centers which was cool because we got to see more of the country but also added a lot of travel time. There was a fair amount of walking so if your traveling with an older person, like I was, be aware.",
        " On the way to Suzhou from Beijing my dad and I were in a plane, some people were on the train, and we were met by Frank, Jeffrey’s coworker. He was also very pleasant and organized. Although my dad and I had limited interaction with him after that initial meeting he remembered us and was always helpful and smiling when we did see him which made us feel comfortable and welcome.",
        "I would recommend Rewards Travel China to anyone interested in traveling to China. I had never done a tour before and decided on this one because of the low price and the fact I was nervous about traveling in such a foreign place without some sort of structure. Alice, Jeffrey and Frank were the perfect guides to ease my nervousness. At the end of the tour it felt like I was hanging out with 27 of my good friends. Overall it was a wonderful experience that I’m extremely happy we did and I think other people will enjoy it as much as we did."

        "When I booked my trip with RTC I was a bit skeptical as to how good my experience would be. When we arrived at the airport it was very easy to spot the driver that took us to the hotel. We had to briefly wait for others that had paid for the same travel but even with such a large group it was very organized. Upon hotel arrival, they filled us in as to what to expect in the morning, what time breakfast would open and what time the bus would leave. The tour guide had arranged for us to have a wake up call every morning which was great just in case our own alarm would not go off. Our first tour guide for the first half of the trip was Leo. He was punctual, knowledgeable, organized and patient. He taught us about the Chinese culture, the Buddhism religion, and was very knowledgeable when it came to Chinese history. The second part of the trip we were with the Sen Xu/Frank/Cooper guides. Sen Xu was amazing. He was kind, greeted us every morning with a chocolate or candy, took everyone’s needs into consideration and tried as best he could to be accommodating with everyone but also knew how to nicely say no. He shared family anecdotes that allowed us to see just how important family is in Chinese culture. He also was very knowledgeable with regards to history and the excursions we were taking. They all rolled out the red carpet for us every day. We’d heard so many negative things about the food and the possibility of going hungry because the food was not the best, but that was certainly not the case at all. The food was delicious. (If you love salt in everything you eat, however, bring your own because they don’t usually have salt and pepper at the table.) I can’t say enough great things about our experience. I have left China with a new found appreciation for the people who were kind across the board (even when they were just strangers on the street) and their culture. The way they eat, play and spend time with one another is definitely a contributing factor to why they live well and generally for so long. They’re a people that do not forget where they came from and appreciate their rich history. There is no “forgotten” art in China because they still do things like painting on rice paper and create silk art. I can not wait to come back to China and RTC was a huge part of why we want to come back. Sen Xu, wǒmen ài nǐ!"

        "We had the good fortune of being escorted by two of the most personable and professional guides that we could have hoped for - Leo and Sen.  They made it clear from the outset that they were there to make our trip as enjoyable as possible.  China was their home and we were their new extended family.  We were treated like family from the moment we met at the hotel.",
        "Their job is not easy.  They have a lot to show and we were busy 12-16 hours a day.  They had to contend with multiple personalities and did so with courtesy and grace.  They made the trip great for everyone in the group.  ",
        "When we booked the trip we were skeptical because the price was unexpectedly low and was too good to be true.  After a little research we believe that the government subsidizes the travel to get tourists to China.  From there there are about 9 options tours ranging from $25 to $79 USD.  Some people take all of them but we chose to stick to 4 trips.  The Forbidden City in Beijing and the cruise on the Shanghai waterway are must see trips - the rest vary according to the tastes of the traveler.",
        "There are a few mandatory stops including the Pearl factory, Jade factory, Silk factory, Tea Garden, and optional Chinese Medicine center.  These are all run by the government and we all got the sales pitch at every stop.  They are very transparent about the fact that they want tourists to buy.  The sales presentations were all skillfully crafted and as good or better than anything that I have seen in the states.  Some people likened them to a time share pitch without the pressure.  I remember at the silk factory and tea garden many people could not get their wallets out fast enough.  After being back a few days and looking back I still feel that people got good value for their money and will not regret the souvenirs that they bought.",

        "This was my second time joining this excursion.  It has consistantly been a great value for an introductory visit to China.  Beijing guides are a bit more polished that the guides from the south of China, but both are passible.  I enjoyed hanging out with the locals and accept that their culture is different from my native origins.  I would caution folks from the LGBQ community to join this group in travel with a thick skin.  I was surprised when our guide pontifocated about how she thought people should be able to choose their own lifestyle, but \"would be very sad if her children came home and said they were gay.\"  She warned the group about a colleague in training as a little bit funny or odd, a nod and wink added. She then added \"I am sure you all know what I am talking about.\"  I thought he might be a comedian then was disappointed when I realized she was making fun of him because he was gay. Sad.",
        "I would also caution folks traveling with young children and adolesants.  While the guides' mastery of English is passible, ours had no sensitivity to dropping the f bomb and other explicatives with children present. Some of the colorful stories were a bit above the understanding of young childern.  Outright profanity with young children is inappropriate.  Perhaps some sensitivity training would be appropriate for guides hosting the mixed groups to which this company markets."

  "description": "We don't just teach scuba diving. We're a team of divers constantly searching for adventure and exploration. We love to scuba dive. And we hope it comes through. It’s a basic human need, exploring the world and searching for adventure. If you look at history, we’re scattered across the globe now, because we’ve been driven by that need to explore. We’ve been about diving for a very long time. We’ve made a career out of it and are very passionate about it. We can’t get enough of it. It continues to change our lives. We believe that once you train a diver, and teach them to dive safely, they tend to care about the ocean, about its conservation and ecology, and about its preservation and protecting it. The more people that we can bring in as certified divers and teach them these things, the better off that stewardship will be along with the survivability and future of our oceans. We think the earth needs a little bit more of that. Come dive with us!",

        "Approximately 13 years ago I joined Etobicoke Underwater Club, I was directed to Aquarius by their senior members.  Since then, I have been using Aquarius as a source of equipment and support.  Over the 13 years I have purchased tanks filles service and repairs.  My experience with them has always been friendly and professional.  In many cases I knew exactly what I was looking for in terms of service.  In other cases, and in particular service and repair, Aquarius has provided what is needed with professional advice.  ",
        "I would not hesitate to recommend Aquarius as the go to dive shop for equipment, service and repair.  I have not taken any training through them but I have no complaints with their service and expect equal professionalism with their training personnel"

        "Peter and Mark are both very friendly, approachable and awesome instructors. I found them Aquarius through google and from thn on the rest was history.",
        "I took the Nitrox specialty course with them, together with Oxygen Provider and equipment specialist. They were flexible in their timing and what's more they are very technology friendly.",
        "What do I mean by this.....they are innovative and also adaptable to the current COVID 19 coronavirus situation and moved their classes online so students like me can have classes via Zoom through the comfort of our homes (see photo attached below). I had a great time!!!",
        "Other than these, the prices of the courses was very fair. The equipment prices were the best in Toronto as well if you need to get equipment from them. I got a free diving mask which allows me to connect my GoPro.",
        "Not forgetting, they also provide the sale of oxygen and tanks during this difficult time if any of you need!!!",
        "Thanks Peter and Mark and can't wait to go diving with you soon!!! ;))",
        "P.S. I posted this review two weeks ago but I am not sure why it is not showing up on google. Anyway, today I went to the shop to get my Kraken torch and Avanti Quattro fins and received excellent and top service from Mark the boss. ",
        "He suggested the perfect fins for technical dives and also gave me a good price. Not only that, he has lotsss of patience to get the perfect size for me.",
        "Also he served me coffee too and just to let you all know, the shop is selling oxygen now which is good to put at home(if you are trained in oxygen provider) in case of emergency due to the virus."

        "Confession: Learning to scuba dive was not high on my priority list. I signed up so that my husband and I could dive together (Scuba diving was something he really wanted to do). However, I was perfectly content with going on a “dive” vacation and being one of the “non-divers” (and sitting on the beach with a drink in my hand, waving goodbye as the boat went out to sea). ",
        "When I first started researching scuba schools, I was originally going to go with a different company closer to us, but my colleague recently took the In Class/Pool sessions with Aquarius (Shona and Hans) and highly recommended them. ",

        "Peter: My husband and I met Peter at the Toronto Outdoor Adventure & Travel Show and we were very impressed with the information he provided. After reading the reviews and since the price was very competitive, we decided to come in and sign up to do the In class/pool sessions as well as our Open Water dives with Aquarius. Peter answered a ton of questions for us and definitely made us feel welcomed.",
        "Harry: I knew to find a mask that was going to provide a good fit was going to be difficult so I decided to purchase the “student beginner package” that included the mask, fins, and snorkel. After trying on maybe 15 different masks, we found one that fit great! Harry was awesome! I was worried that some of the masks were not going to be in my price range, however, Harry was very conscious of this. He wanted to ensure I had a great experience and let me tell you, having a properly fitted mask made a HUGE difference in the pool. I ended up paying an extra $15.00 for my mask and it was the best money I spent, lol. ",
        "Mark: He was always around to answer any other questions and wanted to make sure everyone had a great time! ",
        "CLASSROOM / IN POOL SESSIONS: ",
        "Shona, Hans, Vijay as well as Josee: We had Shona, Hans, Vijay in the classroom and Josee helped with all our gear as well as in the pool. I must say, we were truly fortunate to have these incredible individuals as our teachers. Shona is extremely knowledgeable and everyone shared his or her personal experiences with us, without taking away from learning the information required. ",
        "Tip: Give yourself enough time to do the homework... and make sure to pay attention in class! Scuba diving and all the technical stuff was foreign to me so for me, it was a bigger learning curve than for others who are more mechanically/technically inclined. Ask questions if you don't understand. Trust me, you want to understand. ",
        "Yes, they want you all to enjoy diving and will do whatever they can to ensure you understand both the theory and the practice of the sport… and they will do so as long as you as well as others are safe. ",
        "Hans and Josee: A special shout out to these two – they were our pool teachers for our group and they make a fantastic team. I was pretty much ready to quit after the first exercise in the pool but they made sure I stayed calm, took deep breaths and tried again. After that, everything else came naturally. They are back in Toronto in April and were they were so wonderful to work with! ",
        "I am truly pleased with my experience with Aquarius Scuba so far and I plan to continue taking courses with them. Seems like this “Scuba Diving thing” just might be for me ;)",

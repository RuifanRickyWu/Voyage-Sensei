        "Beautiful exhibit, stunning sculptures, but in an oddly out of the way place, until you understand why it is where it is.  Better to access from Queen's Quay than the foot of Bathurst St. as the approach is much more appealing and you face the sculptures when you get down to the bottom at the lake. Some of the names of those that perished are engraved on the limestone sculpture of a ship at the bottom end of the memorial, the limestone all coming from Kilkenny.  Very peaceful and serene little park, with a history that is so sad, yet so filled with hope for those that arrived in Canada."

        "Ireland Park is the best place to photograph and enjoy views of the CN Tower close-up & to watch float planes leaving from Billy Bishop airport. There are picnic tables and benches, stretching from Toronto School to the park’s statuary. Guirei Japanese restaurant, across from Waterfront Neighbourhood Centre on Leckie Way and Queens Quay, is an option for packed sushi or Korean (cooked) gimbap rolls. The parkside Waterfront Centre has public washrooms and is open daily (until 9 pm weekdays/ 5 pm weekends). Pay parking is not far away at 75 Queens Wharf, or a block further up at 150 Dan Leckie Way aside the Tim Horton’s. We crossed the footbridge over the GO trains at Portland and Front St, facing Concord City Place, and strolled to Waterfront before sunset. You can give yourself 1-2 hours to cycle around or experience the city scene there. For a quick peek, views of the CN Tower were also nice at the War of 1812 Monument park on Wellington St West, closer to the clubs/restaurant strip. Both parks offer visitors an opportunity to appreciate historical monuments and the heritage of the city, especially in fine weather."

        "The first words I spoke upon seeing this monstrosity was WHAT THE HELL! It is insulting to the Irish immigrants (which are my ancestors). They look like zombies and are disgusting. Yes, they came to Canada to escape a famine, but come on, it could have been done so much better. We moved past this mess to read the names of those that came. We were looking for ancestor names but soon found out that wasn't going to happen. Someone took the time to put those names up, but nobody can read them as they are on slaps of stone so close together you can't read them. SO DISAPPOINTING! Shame on whoever thought this was appropriate to my ancestors."

I found myself lingering at each sculpture, making an emotional connection. The sculptures highlights the story of the Irish immigrants that came to  Canada. Despite the location, it is worth a visit to take in these hidden gems "

The grass  area is recovering from a Canadian winter but unfortunately too many dog owners don't know the meaning of \"stoop and scoop\". The black wall is supposed to be a tribute, it's actually very depressing. And the round glass \"thing\" looks totally out of place. The location (next to the disused Canada Malting Silos) and hidden from the airport building by a fence) means not many people will see it unless they go snooping around. ",

Actually, we had a hard time finding it. It was very disappointing to find the small grass area covered in dog poop. I guess people think that if no one sees them leaving their dog poop, it doesn't matter?? Sad and embarrassing that people are not picking up after their dogs at such a cute and small park where people are coming from all over to check out. Very disrespectful! "

        "Ireland Park is a modest but compelling memorial of the tragic history of the mid-nineteenth century Irish famine that pushed massive numbers of impoverished Irish to leave their home country and flee to North America and elsewhere. Many died on the way or after arriving.",
        "Part of the power of the memorial is its starkness and simplicity.",
        "The Ireland Park Foundation also has a web site.",
        "The memorial is just east of Billy Bishop Airport in Toronto Harbour at the foot of Bathurst Street. The address given above is incorrect. It is very easy to overlook Ireland Park, as I only discovered it after a decade of travelling through this airport. I visited on an overcast January afternoon that seemed to add to the feeling of sombreness that the Park induces.",
        "The memorial area is dwarfed by abandoned industrial silos surrounded by a chain link fence.",
        "It consists of several pieces of stonework, and stone with a plaque commemorating the 2007 inaugural of the memorial. ",
        "The focal point though is a series of compelling statues of tragic impoverished and suffering Irish men and women. These statues are very moving. The photographs I posted do not do justice to the statues because of the low light. There is a parallel and larger set of statues in Dublin on the north bank of the River Liffey, if you have a chance to visit there.",
        "It would be nice if the memorial could be enhanced by some sort of border that would set it off from the surrounding area.",
        "This is a powerful remembrance of a terrible event that has shaped modern Ireland, and Canada. Especially for someone with Irish heritage, it invites contemplation and reflection on a brutal chapter of history."

All of them hungry, thin, sick, but still reaching out hoping for a new life in Toronto. There is a  hungry pregnant woman clenching her unborn child, a young child still clinging to hope, and one of the statues is dead, their lifeless body sprawled onto the ground. ",

Arriving on the 'coffin' ships starving, too weak and many sick with typhoid, some died at sea but many died upon arrival. Others had to be put in a quarantined complex that was actually situated at King and John street, 170 years ago. ",

Many did not survive the crossing of the Atlantic. Many more died of disease and malnutrition right near this park. The park has sculptures of the Irish who made (or almost survived) the crossing. The artist is the same who did the Departure statues that you can see riverside in Dublin, Ireland. The Arrival statues are equally moving. Also at the park are giant slabs of stone from Ireland which has the names of the Irish carved in the small openings between the giant rocks. Ireland Park is right near the ferry/tunnel to the Toronto Island Airport - a very short walk indeed and worth the time."

        "This small park is open between waterfront construction periods. A recent visit showed that some elements are not operating, e.g. an explanatory introduction and the book of names. Hence the \"average\" rating. However, the setting and the sculptures are definitely worth viewing. The \"arrival\" sculptures here are a reflection of the \"departure\" sculptures in Dublin, Ireland. In 1847 Toronto received a massive immigration of starving and sick people from Ireland that almost overwhelmed the city. Situated on the harbour near the old Lake Ontario shoreline (Queens Quay and Bathurst Street), the park is close to where the hospital sheds were erected and the necessary burial ground. \"Death or Canada\" is the name of a two-part documentary about this extraordinary migration.

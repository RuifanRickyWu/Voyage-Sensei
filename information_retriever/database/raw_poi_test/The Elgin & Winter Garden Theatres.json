Two volunteers hosted us. Linda let us take the 1913 made Otis Elevator. It is manually operated！They spend two hours to relfect the theatre history and how it was restored including keeping the original spelling mistake. They keep it as Edward time style. It is really amazing to see the only operating double decker theatre in the world on site. I really recommend people pay a visit there. When you know the stories，you will see this theatre differently when you come for a show next time."

My husband is tall, so he was a bit cramped for legroom. A guy as tall as him sat in front of me and blocked the entire center of the stage, so my husband switched seats with me. He has hearing aids, so we stopped at the concession stand that provided hearing assist devices, which he has used in other theaters with success.",
        "What he didn't tell me until the end of the play was, because he had to remove his hearing aids to use the device, he could not pick up any of the high pitched voices (basically all the women in the play). I was so sad to hear he had missed out on so much of the dialogue. He didn't want to disturb me to get his hearing aids, which were in my purse, because he wasn't sure if he would be able to understand any of the dialogue if he had them in anyway. There was no intermission, so he basically just tried to pick up as much of the story as he could with only hearing part of it. ",
        "In using a similar device at Centennial Hall in Tucson, AZ, he was able to hear the dialogue and singing very clearly. It's a shame that we have to pay to see the play again at another location if he wants to really take it all in as intended. They should work on finding a better option for people with hearing loss!",

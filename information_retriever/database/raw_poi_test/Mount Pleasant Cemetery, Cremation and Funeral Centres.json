Mackenzie King but went into the eastern section, where we came across the monument commemorating the crash of AC flight 621 in Woodbridge, ON, in July, 1970. I remember hearing about it the day a happened. Fifty years ago: time does fly."

If you have never been, the Fall season is a perfect time to see this pretty place.  Some of the tombs, monuments and gravestones are very unique and impressive.  Famous people like the Eaton family are buried here.  Can you imagine the monument to an American president who served his country for over twenty years?  William Lyon Mackenzie King was one of the world's longest serving leaders.  He is on our fifty dollar bill.  He is buried here.  See if you can find his grave site.  It is so typically Canadian that his grave site is so modest.  Cherish our country by visiting this cemetery and King's final resting place.  "

        "I visit this cemetery all the time as it is close to my residence and a very pleasant way to spend a few hours. In some portions the graves are over a hundred years old, so you find many gravestones with the names of old Toronto, covered in lichen or disappearing under the grass.  It is interesting that often one sees a family name on a headstone and then \"Mother\" or \"Father\" for the individual grave.  There is a lot of history here -a prime minister is here in a modest plot, victims of typhoid, four fire fighters who died fighting a fire downtown, a hidden section where Chinese workers were shunted off to the side, and of course the ostentatious mausoleum for the Eaton family that has lions in front of it. It is extremely well kept with many large mature trees, which makes it a nice place to walk.  One frequently sees joggers, bikers, roller bladders getting in some exercise. The cemetery extends from Yonge Street to Bayview Ave, making a jump over Mt. Pleasant Blvd.  I am usually of the west side and enter thru the gates in the accompanying photo.  These gates can be accessed from the Kay Gardener Beltline, which crosses Yonge Street south of Merton Ave.  There is a wide alley/public access way just east of the large condo at Merton and Yonge.  Also there is car access from Yonge Street further south closer to St. Clair Ave.  Cars can also access the cemetery off of Mt. Pleasant."

It is an alluring place to visit. It is one of the oldest and largest cemetery in Toronto consisting of many acres of land. It stretches from Yonge Street and Merton to St. Clair and Bayview Avenues. It is alive with life. Many creatures live in the cemetery.  There is music concerts in the cemetery every summer. There is nothing to be afraid of.  You do not have to be afraid of the deceased. You can ride our bicycle through the entire cemetery and there is decent roads for cars too. You will have a grand old time visiting this large cemetery. There a places with benches for you to relax and enjoy the scenery. I would like you to be brave and visit this cemetery in mid  Toronto starting from Yonge street to Bayview Avenue.

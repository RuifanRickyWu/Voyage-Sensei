  "description": "Montgomery's Inn is a museum that has been a Toronto landmark for over 180 years. Surrounded by a rapidly expanding metropolis, it continues to provide visual evidence of early 19th-century hospitality. Built in 1830 by Thomas and Margaret Montgomery, the Inn was a place where locals gathered to exchange news, views, as well as a good meal. Exhausted travelers were also offered a bed for the night. City of Toronto Historic Sites work collectively as 10 historic museums including: Colborne Lodge, Fort York National Historic Site, Gibson House Museum, Mackenzie House, Montgomery's Inn, Scarborough Museum, Spadina Museum, Todmorden Mills Heritage Site, York Museum and Zion Schoolhouse.",

Hours are 1-4pm and our volunteer tour guide offered an intriguing history of the property and life in Dundas circa the mid 1800's.  The tea package afterwards we incorporated into our tour and it was simple but delicious.  Both my senior mom and the littles equally enjoyed."

He consulted with his parents and when he called to invite me he already had Montgomery Inn as the one on the top of his list.  The ambiance was so comfortable and calming and their scones with strawberry jam and cream was delightful!   What a nice way for my grandson to learn how to 'treat a lady'.  I felt very  honoured to seemingly be the first!"

        "Being an inn was just part of the story, and that tells us a lot about rural society (yes, this area was once a day's coach ride from downtown Toronto, so stop complaining about how slow traffic is today) of the time. It was a family home. It was the home base for a 240 acre working farm ( another 240 acres unworked). It was a bed and breakfast for a maximum of three people a night.  It was a meeting hall for political meetings and meetings of the Orange Order.And likely, it was mostly a restaurant and bar, probably managed solo by Mrs Montgomery -- as most of the inns and taverns of the time were. Women's place on the frontier was a lot more edgy than back in the old village in ireland or Scotland.",
        "I love the way the staff here treat this as a living museum. They have an open bar one Thursday a month. They have a farmers market. They have workshops in the kitchen. They bake stuff in the open stone oven out back. They're as enterprising as old Montgomery himself.",

People with kids will enjoy the surrounding lands, and the farmers market. People interested in heritage foods will love the workshops. And people who like oldfashioned beer whisky and sasparilla will enjoy bar night."

Unfortunately the tours are self guided so be sure to pick up a brochure which explains the varied multi-purpose of the building as it was not just an inn but a bar and diner as well alongside being a community meeting hall on top of being a family home . It was nice to wander the rooms at our leisure. Free parking, very short opening times. Located in a lovely part of Etobicoke - not far from the Centennial Park Conservatory / Garden (a free and beautiful city indoor garden) so perhaps worth combining the two attractions at one go."

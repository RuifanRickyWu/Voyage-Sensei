Gibson House offers visitors an opportunity to taste, smell and touch history in a way that few other museums can. Let your senses come alive in this engaging historical family home. Admission General admission is free. Some exhibitions and events may carry a separate charge where noted. Hours of Operation Wednesday to Sunday: 11 a.m. to 4 p.m.",

Not a particularly large place though very interesting and the staff were very friendly and happy to spend the time explaining about the house and those who had lived there. Best of all it was free to visit, which was incredible given that a similar attraction in the UK wouldn't be a cheap day out. Worth searching out. "

        "Gibson House is a heritage museum showing 19th-century domestic arts and rural life skills besides culinary and textile arts. The original owner of the house was David Gibson who was a land surveyor who helped map early Toronto. He was wanted by the government for participating in the Upper Canada Rebellion of 1837 and therefore he was forced to flee to the United States where he and his family remained for 11 years. Eventually the Gibsons built this beautiful home and once again became active members of their rural community.In Gibson Park there is also a public art installation and a large granite wall etched with photos of the Gibson descendants."

The lady making the apple fritters was quite grumpy.Inspite of her,my friends and I enjoyed the delicious fresh goodies. We learned a bit of history about the house. After that visit, we decided to try the Victorian Seance. Unfortunately that was a bust. It was not a real seance. More like a childish game of let's try the Ouija board.Our next event was the Victorian Tea which was dismal. The worst tea experience I've ever had. A bit stingy with the scones and sandwiches. For a first time visit it's interesting. Repeat visits will wear you down."

The tour guide was so good, informative and interactive, as well as kind and well mannered.  The whole group enjoyed her tour so much we clapped at the end when it was over!  We also got to taste home-made ice cream using a recipe of the times, and it was delicious.  The museum is right on the steps of the North York Central subway station, and so it's easily accessible.

Lovely lecture, though, for someone with a background in the War of 1812 and Canada's independence.",

It is a very interesting museum built in 1851 by David Gibson, a Scottish immigrant, land surveyor, local politician and farmer who took part in the 1837 Rebellion - who was then exiled to the US for 10 years, and came back to rebuild his home.  He lived in this house with his wife and their 7 children.  The house has been very nicely restored and is well maintained.   I visited on a Sunday afternoon and at the end of the tour, we were treated to tea and home made cookies.  The tour guides were great, knowledgeable, and helpful.  They were engaging and made you feel very welcome. There is a small shop where you can purchase gifts and or treats.  Well worth the visit.  A very small fee is required.  Pair this museum with a lunch and a great way to spend the afternoon."

Much more than a sports museum, the Hall of Fame offers something for everyone: immersive games in a model rink; the finest collection of hockey artifacts at all levels of play from around the world; theatres featuring 3D and historic hockey films; themed exhibits dedicated to the game's greatest players, teams and achievements; a replica NHL dressing room; larger-than-life statues; an unrivaled selection of hockey-related merchandise within its store; and NHL trophies including, best of all, hands-on access to the Stanley Cup.",

It was interesting to see the Stanley cup, etc, but for me it was just masses of kit and trophies, but what did I expect? He also enjoyed the interactive games, especially being in goal. There is a large shop on the exit to the museum. So as I said in my title, good if you like ice hocky!"

You CAN go through the Hockey Hall of Fame store which then leads into a large atrium of a commercial complex.  Where is the entrance?  Minimal signage, someone says go downstairs.  Find a stairway, go down, walk straight ahead to a wall. Turn around, oh the sign that could have turned me around isn't there!!   Walk to the other wall in the basement of the atrium, there is the entrance!   Paid my way.   The displays are detailed and cover teams, origin of hockey, the equipment, the owners, the players, the leagues and even minor leagues plus some interactive activity if you want to shoot the sponge puck or stop the sponge puck as a goalie.",

After a wait of about 5 minutes the film started (no times of when they start or end).   Was enjoying the film, but a janitor or technical staffer opened an exit door and started talking loudly into his cell phone ... Why in the theatre?  ... anyway watching still when a staffer came into the area (it's really not a theatre ... more of a room set aside to view the films) and said, you have to leave as there are deliveries scheduled.  Another person mildly objected and said why do we have to leave for deliveries, then the person said, it's for a private function.",

        "I was getting more upset and didn't want to stay any longer, so went to the front and asked why a sign wasn't put up before they kick people out of the Legends viewing area?  No response, other than \"oh you can view that online on You Tube\".  Again no real concern.  I asked for a refund.  Blank faces.  Oh and 4 people were gathered around the ticketing area socializing which I must have interrupted.  No refund given. I will never recommend this facility for a visit with all the obstacles to a pleasant experience."

However, once inside, the sheer amount of items on display is enough to rival any other museum in the country! They have old pucks, sweaters, game-used sticks, trophies, etc. Some of the items date as far back as the Original Six! This museum details the beginnings of the league, it's many attempts at expansion, the transition of it being a solely North American sport to one that is recognized all over the World, and the dynasties that have shaped the league. I was hardly expecting what I found when I walked inside. Do yourself a favor, carve out at LEAST 2 hours on any given day and head to this amazing establishment!"

Get in the goalie and defending lines when you see they are short because they don't stay that way for long. The video they take of you doing it is pretty cool and free to download. The history was interesting, especially the history of women in hockey (it's still a pretty discriminatory sport). There's only been one female president of a team ever.  The Stanley cup is great to see in person. It is up a different set of stairs from the gift shop, so don't get confused.

        "If you’re into hockey or just looking for a cool museum to check out, the Hockey Hall of Fame in Toronto is a pretty awesome place.",
        "The museum offers tons of stuff from the NHL, including the real Stanley Cup. You can get your picture taken with it. The place is packed with fun things to do and see. There is a very cool goalie mask collection. You can pretend you’re a hockey pro in interactive zones, or even try being a sports commentator. There is a nice gift shop located in the museum offering many hard to find NHL items. Located in the heart of Toronto, close to many restaurants, attractions, and retail shops."

        "The Hockey Hall of Fame was even better than I expected or was told.  I spent almost 3 hours there and I could have spent another hour looking around if I didn't have plans after!  The Hall of Fame has something for everyone including interactive games for kids, a TSN broadcasting experience, and more memorabilia and history than I've ever seen in one place.  I was blown away by some of the facts and stats I learned by looking at the exhibits.  The Stanley Cup is even bigger than I thought and everyone has the opportunity to touch the cup and get a picture.  My favorite exhibit was the room showing the history from each team going back to their creation.  I also enjoyed seeing the original NHL teams section with the old seats on display and information from their historic stadiums.  I learned a lot about Canadian hockey as well, which I wasn't as familiar with as the NHL.  I bought a program for 5 dollars which is a great keepsake to bring home.  Be sure to check out the massive hockey memorabilia store on your way out!  Thanks Hockey Hall of Fame for a 5 star sports history experience!"

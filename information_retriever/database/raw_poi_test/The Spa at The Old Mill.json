        "I booked a cellulite treatment for one of the areas offered, which on their website says, abdomen, buttocks, thighs and arms. I chose thighs. When I went for my service, I was told I could get the front, the inside of my thighs OR the back of my thighs done for $191 but not my whole thighs. I refused the partial service as described on the website and the Spa Director asked me into her office. It was was filthy, and there was a grossly stained upholstered bench that she asked me to sit on and of course I refused that too. I walked out wasting $4 parking and totally annoyed at people trying to scam with misleading wording on their website."

Not worth the cost and, aside from the massage of hands and feet during the mani pedi, could have gotten the same result in a walk in shop on Bloor Street. Was expecting more of a spa experience for $320 for two mani pedis including tax and tips"

        "I had a Groupon for a spa package that I paid C$135 for, it included the facial, a lip treatment, take home samples and a Latte.  This package was actually more than just the facial which was C$118 so I was guessing it would be a bit more relaxing.  Unfortunately, the facial was brisk and when it came time to put the moisturizer on my face the technician just slathered it on making it go up my nose, it felt a lot like I was being smothered and found myself holding my breath most of the time.  I did get a 25% discount on the products I liked which was nice, but the products in my take-home kit were something the technician told me not to use on my skin type so now I have a bunch of stuff I shouldn't even use.  My skin did feel great after the facial, but I was far more stressed than when I came into the spa.  If you want something relaxing I would check out some of the other places in the area or even in the city."

I also notice that my curtain was starting to wear through a bit, with tiny holes that let sunlight through in the morning.",

        "This review is written because the company doesn’t respect anyone’s schedule and no flexibility on their end. My sister was coming down from Victoria BC, to attend work conference in Ottawa. And my other sister decided to pick her up and celebrate the Bachelorette weekend in Toronto because she is part of the bridal party. My sister decided to pick this place because she belongs to the hospitality industry and she wanted to try out this place.  However, they only had Friday available for the bookings. She took down my sister’s credit card for 7 girls for 4:45 PM for Feb 03, 2017.  Both my sister didn’t end up coming in for their appointment because they got stuck in traffic coming down from Ottawa to Toronto and they got charged the same day for their services that they had booked off and never got a chance to redeem them because management couldn’t do anything about it even though she kept calling in to inform them about their situation. ",
        "Meanwhile, I was working on Friday obviously decided to leave early because I was coming from Oakville. So I left at 3:30 PM and got stuck in traffic. I get inside the spa late and the manager told me that I am not allowed for the full-services instead I can only get my nail polish changed to complete my manicure services. Anyhow, the girl who was performing was mute the entire time didn't say anything to me. I told her that my legs are little dry can you put lotion on my legs and instead she gives me the LOTION BOTTLE TO DO IT MYSELF. I was like okay now that's just rude that I am not even allowed to have her put lotion on my legs?",
        "At this point, I was going to snap on her because I was paying $80 plus taxes just to get my nail polish changed with not a lot of options of nail polishes But I didn’t say anything because I didn’t wanted to ruin my entire night just because of her.  She finished everything by 6 PM and left the room without even saying anything. Anyhow, my friend was right beside me witnessing everything and we also saw another client who was getting his manicure done even after hours the woman still kept going to make sure his feet are nicely cleaned. I wouldn’t recommend this place to someone who is working full-time job on a weekday.",
        "Today, after four days later my toenails are now chipping. And obviously I am going to call the manager to see what could be done in this situation.  Her response was “I know your calling so what is it that you want” and “I said something at least something” instead of another manicure services. I am only getting complimentary nail polish change again like why would I go back to Toronto to just get my nail polish changed. ",
        "Please don't waste your Money for this spa because there is better places out there in Toronto who actually understand if you’re coming from West-end. Please search them by reading reviews. This was not my first time using the Spa services at the Hotel just FYI. I am guessing these services are only good for people who are staying at the hotel and not working during the daytime.",

The bed was very comfortable. The windows open, which is increasingly uncommon in hotels. The room was beautiful and soothing. The fireplace is a nice touch.",
        "The service was outstanding, There is a turndown service at 6:00 pm. The room was very quiet, and I never heard any of my neighbours or any plumbing sounds, both of which can be very common in hotels. The room has a Keurig machine; I find these machines to be an environmental problem and, further, they make mediocre coffee. I travel with my own coffee and collapsible filter, and the staff was happy to provide me with a kettle. All the staff were helpful and gracious, and the manager phoned me the day I checked in to see if I was happy.",
        "The only thing I didn't like was the room service breakfast. The options were limited: Either a continental or a full breakfast. There wasn't much in the way of ordering toast, for example. The continental breakfast contained a good, but very small croissant. The small Danish and other pastry were much too sweet. The coffee was not hot enough for my taste. The challenge with this location is that there are no surrounding cafes or restaurants within easy walking distance. The food I had during the conference was mediocre. So, lovely place to stay, with the exception of the food."

You don't need to bring anything as they give you robes and sandals to wear.  (I just wore my underwear under the robe).  ",

I've never had a facial before and it was the most luxurious thing ever!  It was bliss.  I'm not sure how many things she did, but there was cleansing, exfoliating, moisturizing plus other things including a massage of the face, upper body and scalp - SO nice.  I felt like I was floating!  Next up was the pedicure followed by manicure.  These were equally luxurious.  Antonetta really took care of me, getting me tea and biscotti, etc.  She did a fabulous job on the mani/pedi. The non-shellac polishes lasted almost 2 weeks for my nails and my pedi is still in great shape.  Well done! ",

People were respectful in that room, unlike at other popular spas.  My only beef (besides the ridiculous prices, but that goes for all high end spas) was that the lady who massaged me decided that she was too tired to continue on my body and spent almost 15 irritating minutes massaging my scalp.  By the end of it I was less relaxed than when I started.  This, is my own fault,as I did not say anything.  Not knowing how much time I had left for the massage, I kept quiet.  I should have spoken up, but also, she should have been more balanced in her treatment.  She sat on a stool at my head and just worked on the scalp (my least favorite part) for what seemed like forever - but it was definitely around 15-20 minutes.  She rushed through the rest of the body.  The facial was okay.  Not the best I've had.  The Asian spas in Markham do a much better job with facials. But I wasn't there so much for the treatments as I was for the experience with my best friend.  That was aces.  This place is definitely a better choice than the Elmwood in Toronto.  If you want the zen like atmosphere.  If you want a social club experience, this isn't the place to go!!"

        "I recently went to the Old Mill Spa with my friend for pedicures and the woman doing mine informed me that removing my shellac nail polish on my toed would cost $25.00 when at other spas they charge $5. The woman giving my pedicure was also unhappy at the fact that it was going to take 15 mins longer than expected. So, she spoke to the front desk and decided that I should get a mini-pedicure instead. I paid $25 for a fee that I wasnt aware I was going to be charged and didnt end up with the pedicure i wanted. None of which was my fault. If it's that big of a thing and you intend on maintaining your $25 removal fee, you may want to ask and/or mention this to your clients before they arrive. Not tasteful at all in my opinion. My first and last time there."

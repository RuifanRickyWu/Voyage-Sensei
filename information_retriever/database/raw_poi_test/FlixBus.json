        "This review is about FlixBus that operates between Vancouver and Seattle. They cancelled my booking a day before my scheduled trip of the 15th of October. This was a  Thanksgiving holiday where most trips are sold out. I was not given any explanation or solution. I had to chat with an incompetent individual through their portal, which aggravated me further. Mr or Mrs Khen was totally blasé about the whole situation, which only confirmed that inconveniencing the customer is their regular standard procedure. A refund or rebooking my trip is what they believed was a 'solution' to this cancelation. I had a flight booked out of SEA and needless to say that their 'solution' was not an option in my case. I had to explain to them that these options are not exactly solutions to the customer but rather default options to FlixBus. A refund or rebook cannot be solutions since the company decided to cancel a booking they are expected to rebook or refund! Anyway, I had to look for the only available option, which consists of driving early morning to SEA instead of taking a 4 hour bus. I would never use FlixBus mainly due to their lack of empathy and professionalism. I understand that trips get disrupted but I don't believe companies should treat any customer with such complacency and continues to get business."

        "Booked a bus from Rome to Siena well ahead of time. Arrived to terminal early, got a text from flix stating it would be 65 mins late. Bus came 15mins late, was not notified, it left and customer service tells us to book a new ticket. New ticket was 10times the price ($23 for original ticket to $128 for new ticket). When called customer service states we will not be refunded because the bus came 15 mins late and it was our responsibility to walk around the bus terminal looking for the bus. At the terminal kiosk, the agent stated he could not do anything, speak to the random bus drivers. No help, not reliable, and absolutely no accountability. Avoid this company at all costs."

        "We booked a return bus trip between Toronto & Niagara Falls in August 2024.",
        "This was the first trip that we had booked with FlixBus. The trip to Niagara Falls was fine, we were not able to return back to Toronto as the bus left without us.",
        "It was originally booked to return at 1500.",
        "The FlixBus app stated that the bus would leave at 1520. It left us behind at 1517.",
        "The bus was not a FlixBus, it had a small sticker on the side and it was parked behind several other buses. ",
        "At no point did this bus announce its presence.",
        "We attempted to catch a later FlixBus but the driver said that our tickets were not valid because the tickets were booked via another company. We booked with FlixBus so we would expect them to be honored.",
        "Several other passengers could not leave as their bus was also running late and there was no information on the app or the information desk.",
        "In the end, we used MegaBus to return back to Toronto and they announced their presence and left on time.",
        "Based on this experience, we will not use FlixBus again."

        "Never again!  We purchased round trip tickets from Niagara Falls Ontario, to Toronto.  Since this was our 1st trip to Canada we used the option to scan our tickets and locate the bus number.  Well while we waited (past the arrival time) I asked one of the agents about the bus arrivals, and he told me to check all the buses because they could have a different number.  It turned out to be the case for us, the bus had a different number and did not display Flixbus anywhere on it.  Coming back the bus was supposed to be at a specific gate according to the schedule board.  However, the board showed the bus had arrived and departed as scheduled, but the bus never showed up.  So we got the bus depot agent involved and we were able to get a bus roughly 40 minutes past the scheduled departure on our tickets.  Meanwhile the Megabus and other tour buses showed up on time, at the specified gate with no issues.  Never again!"

        "It’s a nightmare, it was my worst experience ever! Over 4 hours delay on the first bus and another 4 hour delay on the second bus. The bus driver had no clue what he was doing, he had to ask the address from the passengers and that where is the station, he had to do U turn a couple of times and had to pull over a couple of times as he was lost! To a point I was concerned about my family safety and did not feel comfortable riding with that bus driver but we had no choice at that time to stay.  When we got to the border, the new driver informed us the bus broke!!!! As a result of 4 hour delay of the second bus, we missed the connecting bus and had to spend overnight with our 8 years old daughter in Toronto bus station on extremely uncomfortable seats, with a bunch of homeless people and the bathrooms full of drug syringes . When we called customer service, the only thing they said was : “ we can book you another trip for tomorrow morning for free !!! “ oh wow THANKS! As if they were doing us a favour!!! Me and my husband both missed work the next day as a result. Very ignorant, unprofessional disrespectful and dismissive drivers. Terrible and uncomfortable seats, smelly and filthy bus. Wifi doesn’t work, false advertisement. They charged me over 200$ the first time just to reschedule my trip and gave me a voucher for the rest. I was forced to use the voucher. Never again. Trip from hell ! Stay away !"

        "We reserved two panorama seats on Flixbus from Toronto Pearson Airport to Niagara Falls.     Paid extra for reserving those, but just a week prior to trip, we were notified our return seats not available and they changed to rear of bus?    It wasn't a big deal (as we just wanted to get there and back)....but it would have been great if they refunded the extra we paid.   You can't get hold of anyone on their chat line, and a coupon voucher for future trip does.no good in our part of country.    The buses need maintenance inside.   Driver on one trip was inexperienced (riding white line) and almost hit a pedestrian.   Not sure that I'd book with Flixbus again."

        "The charging port was not working from Ottawa to Toronto. The AC was not working. The bus was delayed for about 2 hours. The portable toilet was locked for the entire trip and when I asked for the key, it was full of feces. The bus smells like urine, especially the seats at the back. Also, the portable toilet door from Toronto to Ontario doesn't close properly. The back of the bus where I was sitting smelled strongly of urine! *The only good thing is the bus driver is approachable and friendly.",

        "This bus never showed up. The first red flag was that we saw the bus and the person driving it was getting yelled at because he wasn’t allowed to stop there due to Canada day blocking off certain areas, so the bus kept driving and we all thought it was going to come back but we were wrong. Me and my Mom and everyone else that was going to come on the bus had to walk to ANOTHER bus stop (which was a very long walk I might add) and was stopped at a gate because we couldn’t cross because these guys in red shirts led us to the wrong direction ( I think it was the war museum) then everyone got an email that the bus would be at Pimsi station so then we walked toward Pimsi station and were told off by a police officer by strict warning that they’ll “let it go this time” like it was our fault our bus was supposed to be there, so we walked through Pimsi station and then were told to walk over to the left and our bus should be there, Spoilers! It wasn’t! So my mom checked the location of the bus and it showed the bus had already left Ottawa and was on its way to Kingston. So my mom had to pay $400! for a train just so we could go to Toronto! Will never be using this service again! Also, my mom had to Uber to the train station because we don’t have a car."

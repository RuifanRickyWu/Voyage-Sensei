She carries my shoes and coat and lays my personal belongings gently by my side ",

        "I came here on a Thursday late afternoon. I came to check out the H20 spa. I parked in a spot at seemed good and paid at a parking pay station. When I reached the spa, there wasn't any spots available, so I went back to my car and I received a parking ticket for 'highway stop sign violation.' I was only gone for 10 minutes and I got a $60 parking ticket! The thing that annoyed me is that after I parked, I talked to the ticket violation officer who was giving tickets to the cars behind me and asked him if I was able to add tickets. I realized that I didn't pay enough time using a credit card for the first parking pass, so I paid change for another parking pass. He informed me that that was not allowed and that they only go by the lastest time on the parking pass, which is absolutely outrageous! It's more like the ticket officers doesn't want to add times together because that would mean more work for them. It's easier to give a parking ticet, so that they can get paid. Ugh! Anyways, on my way back to my car, I passed by the officer and smiled at him (he 'pretended' to not notice me). And when I got back to my car, I can see why! There was a stop sign with a cross on it. So, it means no stopping. But there was no 'No Parking' sign, so I thought that parking would have been fine! Toronto should really be better at making understandable signs! And $60 for a parking ticket is disgusting! Anyways, I learned my lesson so the week after when I booked a spa appointment ahead of time, I parked at a parking lot beside Shoppers Drug Mart for $4 per hour (which is absolutely ridiculous!) It was cheaper at $3 per hour for on street parking, but for some reason parking wasn't allowed on the street between 4 and 6pm. What a cash grab! Anyways, I came here for a spa appointment at H20 Spa. Before and after my appointment, I was able to walk around a bit. There's the Danforth Music Hall, which has famous indie acts play regularly. There's also restaurants, grocery stores, pharmacies and LCBO. Taste of Danforth, which is this coming weekend, will be packed! From a beauty viewpoint, there's not much to see. Just a regular neighbourhood...",

Oddly, any restaurant here that calls itself greek has just about the same menu (chicken or pork skewers, and rice with potatoes ; ) but they're all decent grilled food, and most have a good ambiance, vibe and character.

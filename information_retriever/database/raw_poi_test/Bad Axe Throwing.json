  "description": "Bad Axe Throwing Toronto is located in the heart of Junction area, near Runnymede & St. Clair Avenue West. We're just down the street from Walmart. We host corporate events, birthday parties, bachelor and bachelorette parties, or people looking for a fun outing with friends. It's a fun and exciting environment while learning to throw axes. Take your typical night out up a few notches by whipping perfectly sharpened axes through the air at wooden targets to challenge your precision and skill in a whole new way. You can bring your own food & drinks (this is included in your admission fee). Our Toronto facility was designed for memorable, fun-filled times because it‚Äôs where being bad is totally acceptable--and always feels good, even if your game isn‚Äôt strong. Each space includes fenced-off throwing lanes where an expert axe throwing coach will guide you on proper form and technique to really impress your friends.",

Once we got used to throwing he conducted a few competitions in 2 teams which added to the experience. I think we booked for 5.30pm and it was a little difficult getting there in the peak period. Better planning by us would have been better so allow time if travelling from the city. Great time & highly recommend."

I did the tower and the views are obviously great from height, but actually if I’d seen how close we would get to the falls on the final stop I probably wouldn’t have felt the need to do the tower. There is some Niagara Falls information and details about the tower construction inside as well. ",

I didn’t take the boat and didn’t feel I’d missed out. Those who went enjoyed it but commented it was shorter than they’d expected at around 15 minutes.  There is a welcome centre with shops, food, toilets and option to buy tickets for the walk behind the water experience if you have time. This is usually dependent on there not being a long queue. ",

The reason for a 4-star rating rather than 5 is that the bus we travelled on (a 25 seater) had terrible suspension at the rear (I was seated over the rear axle), and would clunk and jolt over any bumps in the road (there are plenty in the city area), making it quite an uncomfortable ride until we got out onto the onto road. As mentioned in some other reviews, the bus can get pretty chilly inside, so be prepared if you are travelling in the cooler months."

They even offered us complimentary water bottles (cold) and maple syrup biscuits. ",

You can leave your belongings in the bus when walking around, so you don't have to carry anything extra item with you (the seats are assigned so you'll spend the whole trip in the same seat). Additionally, any extra attractions that you book on the go need to be payed for in cash. ",

        "Everything went well. The guide was easy to understand and the bus ride was comfortable. We stayed on schedule pretty well, but that of course depends a lot on the group. We had a good amount of free time to walk around the Niagara area and we also had some photo breaks along the way to the falls. We absolutely recommend buying tickets to the Skylon tower from the tour guide. The views were amazing from up there! All in all a great tour."

        "My husband and I were excited for this tour based on all the great reviews. It seemed perfect for what we wanted. Unfortunately, our only experience with Chariots of Fire was meeting the tour group in the morning and then being weirdly handed over to an entirely different tour company, King Tours.",
        "We arrived at the meeting point 20 minutes ahead of the scheduled departure time as instructed and were confused when we and a handful of others were told to go on a different big tour bus across the street. It was not until after the Chariots of Fire buses had left that we realized we were now on a different tour company's bus with no explanation. We had to sit and wait for this bus to pick up other passengers in town, and we didn't leave Toronto until almost 9:30. This was frustrating, as we specifically booked with Chariots of Fire because of the early departure time. It was an irritating waste of 90 minutes.",
        "The tour itself was fine and offered essentially the same things we were promised with Chariots of Fire, but the driver, while pleasant and kind, didn't give us much information or historical background about the places we visited. This was something I was looking forward to based on what I had read about the Chariots of Fire tour. ",
        "We specifically booked this tour because of the smaller buses/tour groups and earlier start and end times, which would have allowed us to catch the 7:00 baseball game we had tickets for that evening. Our bus driver did not seem concerned with sticking to a schedule or getting back by a certain time, and many of the passengers were late each time we re-boarded the bus which made us later and later throughout the day. We also spent an extra hour at Niagara on the Lake, which the driver pitched as a lucky bonus for us, but we would much rather have gotten back on time. On top of that, we hit major traffic getting back into the city (nobody's fault, but exacerbated by our lateness). At the beginning of the day the driver said we'd be back around 6:00, which we thought was fine since we'd still have an hour buffer before the game. We didn't actually end up getting back until after 8:00, which caused us to miss half of the game. ",
        "I understand this may have been a last-minute change due to unforeseen complications on their end, but we felt a little deceived as none of these changes were brought to our attention and it negatively impacted our plans the rest of the day. It appeared to us that Chariots of Fire overbooked the tour and then passed us off to a totally different tour company without explanation. That may not have been the case, but we found the lack of communication and information frustrating. Not what we expected."

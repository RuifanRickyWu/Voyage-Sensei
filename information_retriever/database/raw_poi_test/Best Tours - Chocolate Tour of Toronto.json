It's been two months and this company refuses to issue me a refund. They keep replying to my emails with generic language back. It's a total scam. Save your money. I hope this helps someone before they get scammed like I did. I am also filing a complaint with the consumer protection agency with the Government of Ontario.

        "This company is THE worst! I bought a Living Social deal for a chocolate tour in Vancouver. That was way back in October. Each time I attempted to book the tour was cancelled, sometimes at the last minute. Finally I booked a tour and it actually wasn't cancelled - so I thought! After driving 45 minutes one-way over a toll bridge we arrived at the designated meeting spot - early. Eventually 4 other girls showed up for the same tour. No tour guide showed up after standing there waiting forever. I texted the company asking where the tour guide was and that we were all waiting. No reply until hours later saying that the tour had been discontinued and to apply for a refund through the voucher company. Because the tour cancelled so many times, as it was bought ages ago, and had just expired there was no way for me to get a refund according to Living Social's cancelation policy. That is why 'Best' (aka Worse) Tours kept cancelling and then just before the voucher expires they don't cancel the tour but instead nobody shows up! Wow! These people are scammers!!! Stay far, far away from them!!  Unprofessional is an understatement!!"

Another one told us they had not confirmed that they would be bringing people and that they found them very unreliable and were cancelling their relationship with them! So we drove 1.5 hours, paid $15.00 to park and got no benefit. We ended up visiting Dufflet cakes on our own and enjoyed some treats. They then emailed me and asked how I enjoyed the tour!"

We booked the tour for Saturday, Feb. 18.  A couple of days before the event, I received a reminder from Best Tours confirming the event.  On the Saturday, I received another communication from them confirming the event would be happening in one hour.  We arrived at the designated meeting place after driving into the city and finding/paying for parking.  There were about 20 other people also attending the tour that day.  A couple of people told us that their previous bookings for the tour had been cancelled at least once and sometimes a couple of times.  We were all excited to begin the tour.  ",

Another person contacted Best Tours directly and was told that the guide would be late.  We continued to wait.  After about 30 minutes the person who was speaking with BT informed the group that the tour was cancelled because of the guide.  40 minutes later I received a text informing me that the tour had been cancelled - 40 minutes after it was supposed to start!!!",

No tour guide showed up. Finally went online and did the online chat option to ask what was going on and found out that the tour was canceled. No one in the group had been notified in any form. Not not only did we travel a long way for it, other people did as well and there was also a couple from Ireland in the group who had been awake for 20 hours after traveling to Canada and came right to this tour, only to find out that it was canceled. This was a huge inconvenience and disappointment and very unprofessional of this company to cancel 2 tours and not even inform anyone of the economy cancellation. After emailing the company to find out what happened, we got a standard template response others have gotten that there were unforseen circumstances and these things are completely out of their control.

        "I booked this tour through Groupon with two friends and had a fantastic time. We had only 10 days in Toronto whilst traveling and this tour proved to be an excellent tactic in getting to explore more about this wonderful city. The meet up spot was easy to find and our tour guide made the trip great fun. Loved the route they took us through and even revisited some of the spots after. Would definitely recommend.",

        "Should have read the reviews before booking.  Same deal as everyone else - three cancellations in a row.  When I asked (through their chat line) to rebook to ANY tour in Toronto, was told that no Toronto tours were actually running.  I do not think they actually run any tours at all.  Seems like a scam in hopes that people purchase vouchers and do not have enough patience to get a refund."

        "I bought a Groupon to try the Italian walking tour.  It was cancelled three times in a row.  I tried calling the customer support number on their site, but it's just an IVR without the option to actually talk with anyone.  When I contacted them through online chat, I was told that the reason the tours keep being cancelled is that they don't actually have a tour guide.  I'm not sure why accepting money and bookings for tours for which you have no tour guide is not considered a scam...my advice would be not to waste your money or time with this company,"

Again, it was cancelled, reason being that not enough people were attending the tour. I emailed customer service expressing my disappointment but they simply said I should contact Groupon for a refund. No apology or anything from them whatsoever."

        "The meet up location was easy to find since it was on the corner of a huge intersection. Loved how the tour guide spoke a little about the history of the streets we were on and some background information about each stop. All the samples were full size and definitely bang for your buck (esp if you grab it off of Groupon). Cute date idea or for a girls day with chocolate lovers alike. Not full points because the tour does need to be rescheduled at times if they don't meet a minimum number and they don't let you know until the Wednesday or even the Friday before the tour. "

        "My husband daughter and I were so excited about the Chocolate Tour of the Fashion District in Toronto. We loved the description  of visiting bakeries and boutiques! We got to the meeting spot 45 minutes early and within a few minutes there was two other parties waiting with us. Has the meeting time passed and no one showed up to give us the tour three of us tried calling customer service to no answer. Finally one woman got an email stated that the tour was cancelled due to poor turn out!"

        "I purchased the Chocolate Tour through this company as a gift for a family member. After scheduling a tour date I received a text message the day before the tour addressing the need to cancel the tour and rebook for a future date. Unimpressed I was able to pick another date that fit everyones schedule and booked another tour. Now again I have received a text message two days before the tour explain it has yet again been cancelled. After reaching out to their Support Staff I was told it \"might be\" due to cancellation of guide members. I cannot express my frustration and the inconvenience caused by these constant cancellations. I do not trust this company and will not be recommending these services to anyone else. On top of that I now have to justify my reasoning for a refund. Completely unprofessional and inexcusable."

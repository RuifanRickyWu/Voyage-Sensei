        "Wanda Sykes was amazing.  Hilarious.  No complaints.  The staff at Meridian was terrible.  We arrived early for the show, but still managed to be 35 minutes in line waiting for our phones to be put away in pouches. That was just the beginning of the unorganized chaos.  The opening act was already on stage while we looked for our seats.  Lights were off, no phones for flashlights, we couldn’t see anything. No clue where we were going.  Each entrance kept telling us that we were on the wrong side.  We were sent back and forth three times. The lady on the left hand side told me after we had been sent back to her entrance (which ended up being the right one on our third attempt) “well I don’t know what to tell you.  You might have to ask a few different people to find your seats”.  Not an usher inside to help.  We were a group of five wandering around frustrated and annoyed. When someone finally assisted us, of course there were people in our seats.  The usher walked away and just left us to deal with it.  Again no access to our phones for tickets, and no lights to confirm on the little hand written post it note we were given with our seat numbers.  We sat down with ten seconds to spare before Wanda came on and made us forget about the disaster… until the end of the show.  Zero direction on where and how to take our phones out of the pouches. We were just rushed out onto the sidewalk and forced to find staff to do it..  NO ORGANIZATION OR ASSISTANCE YET AGAIN.  I’m not sure if they don’t have enough staff, but they definitely do not have helpful staff.  I will avoid ever going to an event here again."

The seating was unbelievably tight, worse than coach airline seats or seats in the movie theatres. There was no room for people to pass to get to their seat, even if you’re standing. This seating would be good for the hobbits but that’s about it. If you are tall or fluffy (larger than size 12) then I do not recommend."

The band repeated asked us to stand up and show them that Toronto had some life. We were repeatedly told to sit down and actually told we would be thrown out if we stood up! We were treated like petulant school children and talked down to by rude security staff. We waited a decade for this band to perform together again and the evening was tainted by this venue and their ignorant security staff. ",

For the Tenors show, we arrived 30 mins before the show and were greeted with a line that snaked from the main entrance on front - west to Yonge and south on Yonge towards the back of the theatre.  My wife checked if there was another way in, and nope - same scene to the east where the line snaked on itself for blocks to the East.",

I’m all for security and happy to be checked - but when you know there will be a full house, there has to be a way for additional security to assist in moving things along."

Sounds quality was also an issue, not sure who was in charge of the sound, but the opening act had some issues and at one point in time someone from back stage came out and adjusted a microphone on stage which seemed to clear up the weird noise, then the main act, Kamasi Washington, was way too loud, again not sure if it was the venue or the musicians and their people who decided on the volume.  The venue itself is really showing its age as well with tight seating and old decor that is starting to fall apart in some areas.  The least favourite venue I have been to for a concert/show.  The music from the concert was really good, just very loud as stated above."

We sat down and when the performance started my son sat in my lap which meant his seat was open. A few minutes in a couple came with there son and he asked me to move my bag from the seat I paid for, I said why, he then tells me that the seats he paid for someone else was occupying and the usher told him to sit in my seat. I am sorry but if my son decided to sit on his own he couldn’t. ",

        "What to say about this venue. First off, I am not a huge concert attendee, so I don't have too much to compare it with. But, I found that the sound/acoustics were great. The sound was full and not brash. The seating was nice. I didn't feel too much like a sardine. :) My view was pretty great, even with the tallest man in the row directly in front of me, the way the seating is set up I could easily look around him.",
        "The cost of refreshments was pretty high. $4.00 for water... but maybe that is average. ",
        "Overall, I enjoyed my night out at The Sony Centre."

        "We attended Norah Jones concert tonight, I recently had a knee injury and found it quite difficult to keep my leg straightened in my seat in the balcony area.  I decided to stand up and wait in the aisle until the concert started.  While standing there one of the ushers (Leonard, I hope I have his name correct) came up and asked if I needed help.  I explained what the problem was, he said he was going to check with management to see if there was anything they could do.  A few minutes later one of the management team came up and advised they could move us to a different seat where I could stretch my leg out.  There were actually three people in our party, he didn't  realize that originally, the new seats where only two. I advised just one seat would be fine so he took me down to the lower level and moved to to the 14th row from the stage with two seats on the aisle.  These are amazing seats and made my concert experience so much more comfortable.  I did not ask to be moved, they came to me and offered to make my attendance much more enjoyable!  Definitely above average customer service.  "

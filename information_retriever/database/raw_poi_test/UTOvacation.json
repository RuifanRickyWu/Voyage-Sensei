October 2023 they called to say that China was still not opened up fully due to Covid and that they needed to move our dates out (October 2024). In October 2024 they said that the suppliers were having trouble due to Monkey Pox and they suggested we move the trip out to 2025. They gave us three weeks notice of this. I told them I wanted to cancel the trip and be refunded and they said that was not possible - no refunds (as in their agreement). I had no choice but to move the trip to October 2025 but I don't think we will be taking the trip - at all (as I don't think they are actually doing tours) - plus I doubt I will get any type of refund."

The company made excuses for every date they promised I could travel on and charged me more for a vacation that did not exist.. When the date arrived they postponed because  of covid or issues with China or some thing else. Now the same trip costs 12,000 K or more which I cannot offord. I am a 78 year old retired lady. I tried to correspond with TICO a government agency in Canada where UTO is based, even they refused to help knowing UTO is scamming their customers. It  is shame when the these agencies let such companies like UTO operate in their jurisdiction.  i am so disappointed in the corrupt systems we live in."

My family of four booked a trip to China and Thailand, they cancelled due to the pandemic, but when started doing business again, they sent me a letter asking me to choose among three choices: 1. go on the trip (as long as it was for less than 144 hours stay, which we could not tell with certainty because we had not received the itinerary); 2. get a credit for a future trip; and 3. get a full refund.  We chose the full refund (I have copy of the email). They took a while to respond and finally called me stating that they could not do a refund and only credits were being issued.  I explained the choices they had given and what I selected, but she insisted that they were not going to give refunds regardless of what I chose.  Their current trips are so expensive that I am not interested in using the credit to travel with them.  I want a refund.  Anyhow, they have not budged and are pocketing $1,200 deposit we had provided. They should be put out of business."

        "I was never able to travel with this company.  I originally booked a trip to China for several family members.  Obviously that was canceled.  Then, I rebooked, using my credit, to Greece.  That trip was canceled for no good reason AFTER I paid it off and added upgrades, and I was told I could rebook for a different week (I should have!), but as a teacher, I'm limited to travel times.  Finally, I rebooked for Morocco for Nov. 2023, and was kicked off the trip for not having my passport info uploaded more than 6 months in advance! They even stole $600 from me for \"canceling.\" Now, the prices have been jacked up so much, I'll never be able to use my THOUSANDS of dollars credit, ever."

Our guide Peter had no information about anywhere we went he would use Google to answer our questions. Do not use the company they cancelled all of the add-ons and now we have to fight to get our money back."

        "I booked the trip to China and Japan before the Covid start with the hope that we can go to the trip in March 2023. However, Covid hit, so they asked us to cancel and gave us travel credit. However, the price was never be the same. We had to pay 3-4 times more for the same trip that was forced to cancel. I have had contacted them the past month to try add more days to the trip in November 2025 but no one responded. I emailed and tried the chat but no one replied. This company is definitely shady . I don’t feel comfortable with the communication. Definitely will not recommend and will not book with them again. Now all I want is money back!"

        "Completely scam. Originally booked trip to China well advance before pandemic, paid in full. Trip had been canceled due Covid.   Rebooked to the  next available date, was canceled again, rebooked second time and again, same scenario, trip was canceled. I requested money refund or rebook my tour again, they refused and instead give me credit promising in the future re-book me on similar trip  and match original price. No way, I contacted tenth times after, no response at all, my credit is useless as current tours price is unreal high and credit expired in 4 days.  ",

        "Let me begin by introducing myself. I am a retired travel professional from North Carolina. I have a 40-year career in the travel industry; as a Travel Agent, a Travel Agency Owner, a Tour Planner, and an International Tour Guide.  I have traveled widely on international tour packages sponsored by Travelzoo, and have had many superlative experiences.  UNTIL, I recently booked with UTOvacation based in Toronto, Canada.  We placed a $5908 deposit on a 5-star Egyptian “Touch of the Exotic Tour” and were attempting to call in our final payment of $8698, when things went south. The final payment deadline was still about 14 days in the future, and when we called to give them the payment, we were thrown into a telephone recording loop that advised that we would be disconnected if no one answered in 3 minutes. After about 10-12 tries and disconnects, in desperation we even tried their phone prompt that would direct us to the “book a new tour” line (thinking surely they would prioritize incoming money), only to have the same results - no answer and then disconnected after 3 minutes. We tried this over and over again throughout the next 2 business days during their opening hours with the same result.  This was unprecedented and worrisome and therefore, we began to look for reviews on line. There was an exhaustive list of scathing reviews on each site we investigated, claiming the company was a scam, not delivering on parts of tours or quality of hotels that were promised, not giving refunds that were due, cancelling tours at the last minute and only providing a credit for a similar future tour, which turned out to have hyper-inflated pricing - sometimes triple the cost of the first trip.  When we checked the Better Business Bureau site, UTOvacation rating had a big “REVOKED” banner stamped on it.  So we canceled our trip by email, 10 days prior to the final payment deadline, requesting a full refund on our deposit, and to date they have returned only approximately ¼ of our deposit.  ",
        "In my opinion, you would be wise to not add your name to the list of upset and dissatisfied customers unable to get money back or having poor travel experiences; save your precious travel dollars to spend with a tour company who has a consistently good reputation.   ",
        "Update:  UTOvacation rating disappeared from the US Better Business Bureau and has now reappeared with no history or complaints, nor any accreditation."

        "First, you shower, then jump in the hot tub, then you are called in for the scrub. There were two tables, so another lady was on the other. The scrubber is in panties & a bra & has buckets of hot water to slough you off as she scrubs. You turn over, side, stomach, etc. It felt amazing, especially my palms and soles of my feet. Like a massage, but better. I felt a bit dizzy getting up but the two scrubbers flew to my side & clucked over me & I felt entirely cared for. I would definitely recommend it."

        "I had my reservations based on the other reviews but once I arrived I felt much better. The entrance is a big area with lockers for your shoes. The shoe locker is linked to your locker number inside the change room. We were met by a friendly receptionist and paid for the services I chose. It was expensive compared to Korea but I think that was to be expected. ",
        "The change area was spacious and clean. I changed into my uniform and went into the common area to meet my husband, it was his first time in a Korean spa. We sat and chatted. Then tried the dry saunas in the back. Loved the ice room which cooled us down. We then had lunch which was good and was happy to see a cold and hot water dispenser. ",
        "I had a scrub and facial scheduled so I went into the wet area to prepare. Again this area was clean. Everyone in the wet area were nude but I felt comfortable which is not my usual state. I took my shower and soaked in the cold and hot pools. I didn’t try the wet sauna. The scrub and facial were great. I was surprised to see someone was already in the  scrub room. Anyway by that point I was ok with the nudity. Lisa was my scrubber. Her English wasn’t great but she was very nice and made me comfortable during the whole process. ",
        "I highly recommend this place to relax and for a scrub. ",
        "They told me they are working to update the website with more info. Our visit cost just over $200 including two entrances and my scrub and facial. Entrance fee is $30. Totally worth it."

        "The heated rooms are nice, but out of the 6 rooms, 3 will be the same temperature, the lowest one (36 degrees) It would be nice to have varied temps throughout for a better experience. ",
        "The used to have couches but they converted them into these solid hard benches that are super uncomfortable, probably to prevent people from staying too long. The entertainment area is non-existent. There's a pool table you must pay for, some old board games at the food kiosk (not sure if you have to pay to use them) and some Korean books. ",
        "If you come at the same time as the Russians, prepare to have the worst experience because they're loud and obnoxious. Every single time I have come (about 10-12 times) there have been Russians who won't shut up and respect the be quiet sign. It's not the best place to meditate with them around so make sure to run when you hear them. Trust...you can't miss them. ",
        "Overall the hot tub and the varied rooms are pretty great, but overall Jimjilbang needs a face lift and some cleaning. ",
        "Again, a lot of these comparisons are from living in Korea, and the differences are night and day. Not to mention that in Korea 24 hour access is only $10 compared to the $28 here. But I digress."

        "I have been coming here for many years, and lately it's become a very big problem to communicate with the staff, they are extremely rude with other nationalities other than Korean. Even if you schedule an appointment prior you won't be taken at that time, instead of you a Korean person will be taken, where did that person even come from? It was impossible to talk without arguing and yelling. They are saying that they lack English when taking reservations and not scheduling your appointment. When I called one day prior to scheduling my appointment, the person was speaking English very well and we discussed all the details and she confirmed that my appointment is scheduled. But the next day, when I came there, they said that there is no appointment under my name. The business owner - a very terrible person recommended to shut up and leave in a very rude and aggressive manner. I will never come back to this place and I do not recommend anyone to come here, all I experienced was stress instead of relaxation."

        "I have been fortunate enough to experience this kind of spa in Korea and similar hammams in Turkey and Morocco  This is very authentic in terms of the scrub and saunas. The body scrub is vigorous and when I say the attendant gets into every nook and cranny, I mean it!! You leave totally relaxed and baby-smooth. I would definitely go again - but just for this service. Be prepared to call the attendant when it is the time you have booked - they don't seem to adhere much to the schedule so plan to be delayed 15 min or so. ",
        "The saunas are OK but a bit crowded; there is only one small hot pool and one cold (usually you have a choice of several but really, one hot one is all you need to prepare for the scrub); the large relaxing area is irritating with children running around, TV set to Russian (!) talk program and just not very nicely decorated. But as I said - go for the scrub, it is worth it.",

        "The heated rooms are great. I started with the least hot one and worked up to the hottest. Was sweating very quickly. But except for the sauna rooms, the place feels a bit utilitarian and run down. The wet area tiles are stained and some are loose, although the pools are in fine shape. They supplied communal bar soap! I used their dollar store shampoo instead. The sofas are faux leather which are peeling off in an ugly way. The walls in the lounge and the change room are plain white and very sterile looking. When I was there, none of the TVs were on. I had a `leg massage` - very nice on the calves, ok on the thighs, not so good on the feet.",

The line was huge when we arrived and the lady at the desk was helping staff not processing clients.  The change room area includes a steam room, hot tub and cold tub with of course showers.  This is a NO clothes zone.  For me that's not acceptable.  I don't feel comfortable with that and I had come prepared and brought a bikini to wear.  The massage staff told me to remove it and I absolutely refused - after more back and forth I left, feeling uncomfortable.  I changed to the uniform provided and went into the other area.  This is one large room with a small snack bar, two pool tables and couches and a few treadmills.  There are no arcade games as shown in their online photos.  If you wish to play pool you need cash.  We tried to have it charged to our locker and was nearly refused.  They should advertise this.  The actual sauna area was nice and the individual rooms are as shown on their website.  It was a busy day so not as relaxing as it could have been - loud people talking, kids vomiting etc.  ",
        "Upon exiting you pay a tab for whatever you purchased at the snack bar.  My bill was $4.50 and I only had debit.  The minimum for debit is $10 so be sure to bring cash or spend that amount because the guy at the desk wanted to take $10 anyways.  No where does it mention this minimum.",
        "Will I be back?  Probably not but if I do I'll continue to wear clothes in the shower area - my first visit I certainly didn't pay $25 to find out AFTERWARDS that I must be naked, what place requires that!?  They should make that known on their website so that people like me can avoid the place - it resulted in me feeling very uncomfortable and only able to enjoy half of what was offered. "

The layout was good too with a side room closed off from the main hall and then individual smaller sauna rooms, but people still did not keep quiet even though there were 2 large signs to be quiet. It was difficult to find a sauna room without an ongoing conversation from either a couple or group of friends, or even when I found a room, you could hear loud groups of families talking loud just outside the door with kids running around... Staff are so-so. When asked about keeping quiet in the sauna rooms, one lady just shrugged. The snack bar was cheap looking and provided low quality of service: cold eggs, small cups for tea bag tea and no lids (for $2!)... Tips: 1) bring your own bath towel unless 2 hand/face towels is enough for a shower after. 2) save tax if you pay cash for admission."

The different mineral sauna rooms, such as jade, germanium and elvan stone, all have different but equally beneficial healthful properties. Also, due to the many options and different temperatures in each room, there is something to suit everyone's individual preferences.",

Clothes (a loose t-shirt and shorts) are provided for everyone using the sauna and in the common area there are many large tvs for people wanting a break from the saunas, a place to buy snacks (korean chips, handrolls, soy-sauce boiled eggs..) and board games available.",

Out of all the chiropractors, physio therapists and massage therapists I have ever been to, Mr.Kim at the Seoul Zimzilbang is by far the best ever! Everyone I have ever recommended come see him has said it was the best massage they have ever gotten in their lives. However, it is important to note that it is a very deep tissue massage and may be to much pain some people. ",

Once we did, buying a ticket was a piece of cake and they gave us a schedule, so we didn't have to worry how and when to get back from which ferry stop on the islands. They are not super close to each other if you are walking (they look close on the map but you can't cut across to shorten the walk). But the ferries themselves were clean and smooth."

Queuing for the ferry was a horrible experience. There is no queuing system, people just simply wait and converge by the big iron gates, once they're opened, you'll attempt to get onto the ferry and grab a seat. There's nothing to stop people barging and pushing past you. If you're going as an individual or in a group of grown ups, it's fine. However with two very young children, it was a very poor experience."

It was crowded, raining but still just 1 boat was serving all passengers. All the people including kids, elderly were exhausted and tired. Not at all happy with today’s trip."

        "I was left sick and stranded on the Southern Spain Tour. I am a 72-year-old senior who speaks little or no Spanish. I've traveled with the group several times in the past.  This trip was unusual because I had three leaders over two weeks. I came down with a virus in Seville.  It was my bad luck to get sick and have a leadership change during this period.  I had to stay in the hotel until I recovered.  My wife and other tour members went on to Barcelona.  I contacted all three tour leaders and the 24-hour hotline.  I got no text, phone call, or assistance from either.  I was left to my own devices to make it to Barcelona. I tried to report this when I got it.  I tried to get through to everyone.   I suspect you will have a good experience with this company if you stay healthy and avoid injuries."

        "I did the 10 day tour, but the original loop is 18 days, and there is a shorter option for 13 days. I wanted to join the 13 day tour, but because of my job- I could only leave a week later so I did the 10 day one.",

I would be a bit more prepared as I know now what works for me! Gadventures provides the tents and the mattress, and you just bring your own sleeping bag (tip- get the colder season one if you are doing the tour in September + a blanket. In Bryce Canyon it got down to 2 degrees at night!).",
        "I was mostly interested in seeing the nature so I did not want to spend much time in the cities. Bryce Canyon and Grand Canyon we camped in the middle of the park which made it super convenient to wake up early, breakfast and go hiking early in the morning. If we stayed anywhere else outside- would have taken ages (met a solo traveller who said it took her 4 hours from entering the parks to actually parking to be able to hike meaning she could hike from 1 pm onwards). With the trails in the Grand Canyon- you need the full day to go down and back up!  ",

He said that the hikes and optional activities either didn't exist, were too difficult or weren't available. We were left in the countryside without access to taxis, so we were stuck with no activities to even arrange on our own. The CEO stated that the coastal path of Cinque Terre is too difficult and would take more than two days to complete - itinerary states the hike takes 5-6 hours. He also said the morning hike through the hillside villages near San Donato Fronzano to Castello dei Bonsi does not exist. Optional activities are for you to find and arrange on your own.

        "G Adventures is an excellent company and provides unbelievable experiences. I have done 5 tours with them (and will be on my 6th next week). I’ve seen many negative reviews on here but they all seem related to the reviewer’s inexperience with travel or not reading the information provided by G Adventures. As a person who has extensively traveled with and without G Adventures, I cannot recommend them enough. ",
        "Let me first address many of the issues in these reviews: not knowing what to pack, not knowing itinerary, running into safety hazards, etc. G Adventures provides extensive documentation on what to bring, what to expect daily, what their fees are, what meals are included each day, etc. Traveling also comes with inherent risks. As an American, my food is prepped to FDA standards. G Adventures certainly helps you stay safe by offering advice on foods to eat, food prep practices to look for, and advice if I get sick but risks such as getting sick or having phones stolen is not the responsibility of G Adventures, merely you have a safety net if things to do happen. You are still responsible for yourself. I still got food poisoning in Costa Rica but my guide was there to accommodate me and point me towards pharmacies. ",
        "Having said all that, what G Adventures does offer. They often offer basic hotels (but clean and often very cute with some fantastic amenities) but there are upgraded tour options if you’re looking for 5 star. G Adventures prides themselves on buying local, so you will not be getting a Hilton. There’s often private transportation which navigates you quicker than public from destination to destination (I’ve been on a public bus for hours in Central America with no air conditioning, squished in a seat with two other people…it’s sometimes nice to sit back in an air conditioned van). They provide unique experiences I probably wouldn’t have found myself (cooking classes, bike rides with locals through adorable Indian towns while being chased by herds of goats, home stays on cute rural villages in mountains of Vietnam). They are also good at helping you set up your own activities (went to Belize with a woman wanting to scuba dive in the blue hole, and our tour guide gave her all the information on how to get that set up for after her trip and she sent me the pictures!l). They also offer a great perspective into their cultures. All guides are required to live in the region prior to hire so they know the great spots for a street taco or can tell you what their education growing up was like. Yes, G Adventures is more expensive than going alone. BUT I have never felt the money wasn’t worth it. The guides are constantly organizing and troubleshooting to ensure the best trip imaginable and some of the experiences and ease of traveling could never be compared to the experience I’d get on my own. So far I’ve been to Vietnam, Belize, Guatemala, Mexico, Costa Rica and India with them. Next week I’ll be hiking in Nepal with them."

        "The booking process of G-Adventures made it such an easy way for my girlfriend and I to experience Thailand. We completed both the “Northern Hill-Tribes and Villages” and “Southern Sojourn” components of the Night Markets and Blue Waters tour. Much of our tour was fantastic, including the amazing hikes, activity guides, snorkelling, and sight seeing opportunities. ",
        "That said, the reason for the AVERAGE review is due to tour guide clarity, adherence to the itinerary, accommodations, and affordability. Firstly, the tour guide we got was very nice but was poor at leading the group. At almost every location, my girlfriend and I were confused about the plans. This was particularly painful for an OCD person like myself, especially when you are on the other side of the planet. Secondly, if you want a tour that follows the itinerary, be prepared for some differences. Every time the itinerary stated “try street food” or “experience the local food” we ended up going to a sit-down restaurant. This is much more expensive for a young traveller like myself. Thirdly, most the accommodations were okay for Thailand standards and others were VERY poor. More specifically, if you are staying poolside at the Rainforest Resort in Khao Sok be prepared for ants EVERYWHERE and if you are staying at the Seashell Resort in the bungalows be ready for no wifi, run-down bungalows with holes in the ceilings, no hot water, and a green pool. These accommodations alone were enough to give the tour 3/5 stars as they were horrendous. On the bright side, the locations were great and the activities offered were amazing! Lastly, the tour (in my opinion) is overpriced. When you consider the price of local, stand-alone tours and other better quality accommodations, I felt slightly ripped off. Furthermore, when the tour guide is taking you to restaurants (rather than street food) and only around 50% of meals are covered, it is expensive. ",
        "In conclusion, this trip was a great time! My girlfriend and I will always cherish the friends we made and activities we completed. However, be prepared for some significant downsides mentioned above."

        "Just completed the Uncover India: High Deserts & Markets tour this past week. What an amazing trip to an incredible country. G Adventures delivered excellent customer service from beginning to end. From booking, to arranging flights, to fielding multiple questions pre-departure, I had a great experience working with them over the phone. On site in India our CEO Guarav was the real all star though. From our first collective meeting he made our group feel completely welcomed, safe and excited to explore. His positive energy and sense of humour were endless, and kept us laughing, motivated, and united as a group throughout our travels. If there was ever a standout ambassador for G Adventures and what the company represents, it is truly him. And huge credit is due to him for making the trip as memorable as it was. The tour itself was tightly packed and fairly fast-paced, but with a purpose, allowing us to visit numerous sites and cities, and cover many miles, in a relatively short amount of time. Our group was also wonderful and filled with lovely, adventurous folk from around the globe. Would highly recommend. Great memories made with phenomenal people."

We went for dinners together as tour guide knew good places and choice of food and drinks was good and not too expensive. Guide and driver were very good.  They are still obsessed with the revolution 65 years later as we went to 2 museums re: Castro and Che.  Overall tour was OK and glad to see Havana but not quite what we were expecting."

        "Total lack of disclosure when booking airline flights for the tour we had booked with them.  They made it sound like the discounted flights were because of their volume, but in reality, they had not booked our seats which were $200 per flight, per person extra.  When the airlines changed our flights and then we needed to make changes they refused to discuss it on the phone, instead it was tons of emails back and forth, even after I supplied them with the specific flights and times. Each time they send new options (that don't match what I asked for) they tack on extra charges.  Currently we are up to an additional $800 per person over what I could book myself directly.  Several weeks into this, hours of back and forth, we still do not have the correct tickets and they refuse to provide a flight credit so that I can handle it myself.  ",

        "My wife and I booked the 15-day Delhi to Kathmandu trip in January 2024. It's got great reviews on their website (4.7 stars out of 1700+ reviews), and the reviews appear to be from Trust Pilot; however, I later noticed that not one of the reviews were actually collected from Trust Pilot - it looks like they cherry pick comments from their internal post-trip surveys. The trip was billed as a \"classic\" travel style with a standard service level. Our CEO was kind and knowledgeable. There were about 10 of us in the group, and everyone was nice and got along well. ",
        "The reason for the low rating is the accommodations selected by G Adventures. We only experienced two of them, because my wife and I cancelled the remainder of the tour and left India after two nights. I know India has decent hotels, but G Adventures doesn't use them, because part of their mission is giving back... which means putting you in dumpy hotels to help keep those struggling small businesses afloat.  ",
        "We stayed at Hotel Perfect in Delhi on the first night. It was in the middle of a very loud, crowded, poor, and noisy area of Karol Bagh. We didn't feel safe leaving the hotel on our own, and didn't see anything on the drive in that caused us to want to explore anyway. Our room faced the street, and the old leaky windows did almost nothing to keep out the cold air and horn honking, which continued until well after 1:00 am. The room was dingy, uncomfortable, and very cold. The shower would not produce warm water, and the toilet would not flush even a small amount of solid waste. ",
        "On the second night, we stayed in a hotel in Jaipur (Utsav Niwas) that was a little less depressing than Hotel Perfect, but even after walking downstairs for help a few times and having a few employees give it a try, the shower would not produce warm water. Our CEO was able to get us moved into another room with a new hot water heater installed. Still, this required multiple employees coming into our room to get the warm water working. By this time, my wife already had enough.  ",
        "From what I could tell during our two days there, India is a crowded, dirty, chaotic place. My wife was hoping to at least have a warm shower and a clean, comfortable room to come back to at the end of the day's activities. You can find that in India... just not with G Adventures. ",
        "We paid G Adventures $4,258 for a 14-night trip (one of which would have been spent on a train). Considering the low quality of the lodging and travel accommodations, and the relatively low cost of most things in India, I'm not sure where all the money went. We contacted G Adventures after we returned home and requested a refund, at least for the $600+ worth of optional excursions that we pre-paid but didn't get a chance to do. They refunded the cost of the first two hotels but nothing more. I wouldn't recommend using G Adventures to anyone except the most hardy, budget-conscious travelers."

Locally, this tour is delivered by Arctic Adventures on behalf of G Adventures. First, the good. Our tour guide was most excellent! This name was Hilmar and he was friendly, knowledgeable, personable, and flexible! He kept us safe and on track while sharing so much information along the way. He was an excellent driver in the treacherous winter conditions. We cannot say enough good things about him! As for the tour itself, we saw a lot of different things and a couple extra place that were not in the original itinerary. The small group of 14 travelled in a Mercedes Sprinter bus which was fairly comfortable. The longest drive was 1:45 but most were less than an hour before stops. A couple things that should be added to the packing list are crampons and perhaps event goggles! A pair of slippers or slides would have been nice to have in the guest house where boots/shoes were to be left at the door. We told G adventures we don’t eat fish and so we were given the option to have vegan fake meat which was not ideal. Otherwise, no concerns and would 10/10 recommend this tour!"

Our Guide was excellent and went above and beyond  what I would expect.  but there were several small items that knocked this tour down from a 5 to a 4.  There were several items, particularly the Sunset tour on the Salt Flats and provision of bottled water that should have been included but we had to pay small amounts extra for.  The biggest complaint was that the tour started in La Paz and then spent the first day flying to Sucre, so we effectively only had 2 days in Sucre, not the 3 days promised in the itinerary.   It would have made a lot more sense to start the tour in Sucre.",

      "text": [
        "My time at G Adventures was held together by the wonderful field staff. However, the organization of the program itself was incredibly disappointing. ",
        "Let me explain. ",
        "First off, it says 5D/4N on the itinerary. It was not 5 days by any means, “one day” counted a 30-minute briefing at the office. On top of not getting my moneys worth from the program only being 4 days, there were 3 meals during the trip that were fully unpaid for by the company, and we had to seek them ourselves. Seeing as I paid $950 for this experience, I am unsure why the company could not provide these meals. ",
        "Secondly, why was my trek called “trekking the Inca trail” if I was not trekking the Inca trail WHATSOEVER? It was entirely Lares. If you want to run a Lares trek program, just say so, and do not leave your customers confused. Additionally, if you’re going to run a trek, there should be more than one day of “trekking”. The first and third days were incredibly easy and were a disappointment for someone who wanted a multiple day “trek” experience as advertised. ",
        "Third, and the biggest surprise of this trip, was that I had no idea I was going to be the single traveler on the program. This initially made me feel very isolated and uncomfortable. Thank God I had Maju as a guide, otherwise I am unsure if I could have continued. Trekking alone with no other travelers is something that should be blatantly advertised. As a young female solo traveler, I was looking forward to meeting others in a similar position to myself, and the lack of transparency from G adventures resulted in me missing out on this entire piece of a trek experience. This was a real bummer for me and speaks to the lack of communication given to participants on G adventures programs. ",
        "Fourth, the first hotel provided by G adventures was at the corner of the city, and walking there late at night made me uncomfortable and simply scared. It was also a fluorescently lit, unwelcoming environment, and should be reevaluated as a place used by G Adventures. ",
        "Overall, this experience was completely different than I could have expected. It was not bad, per se. I loved my guide Maju and the beautiful Andes mountains. I loved the wonderful food and service by Marco and Eduardo. They were all incredibly kind, attentive, and passionate. I could not imagine a better team, as they really did make my experience a special one. However, my perception of G adventures is that the management of this company is completely financially driven. ",
        "My advice to other travelers is to find a PERUVIAN company that truly has your best interest in mind. Using a local company will also ensure you’re helping their economy, and it will likely also be more worth your time and money. I wish I had done more research on this company and trek beforehand. Just make sure you understand what you’re signing yourself up for."

        "We had a terrific 11-day guided trekking and sightseeing tour of Bhutan which we had booked with G-Adventures, indirectly through an Australian company.  ",
        "We were part of a group of 14 travelers from the US, Canada, UK and Australia.  ",
        "Our tour was called the Camp the Trans Bhutan Trail, which includes trekking along sections of the historic 403km trail walked by members of the Royal Family, monks and traders up until the 1960’s.  It has recently been reopened and available for foreign tourists to trek, with support from local travel guides and support crews.  The trek is a series of daily hikes between a selection of camps set up each day in forest surroundings, and accommodation in home stays, modest and mid-range hotels.  ",
        "Our tour was originally described in the brochure as a 93km hike, however for various reasons it was reduced to approximately 60km, which was a bit disappointing.  ",
        "We were most fortunate to have two guides on this trip as one guide was ‘in -training’. Be aware that if you are on a tour with only one guide the pace of the hiking is determined by the slowest hiker. This can be problematic, especially as the tour was graded as ‘challenging’, hence implying that an above average level of fitness would be required to participate. I would suggest G-Adventure clearly define what ‘challenging’ means for different age groups of hikers and perhaps suggest some training schedule too. ",
        "  ",
        "We were all picked up from Paro Airport on the first day by our guides Dorji and Sangay, and CJ our driver, and transferred to Thimphu where our trekking tour started.  Transport was in a 20 seater bus, and was mostly comfortable, although some trips were quite long and a little tiresome.  There were several stops on these longer trips, with meal and regular toilet breaks. ",
        "Our treks were a mixture of steep treks up and down the valley walls, and some more leisurely walks along the valley floors, through small villages and walks along the ridge tops.  The views were very spectacular, with some views of the mountains into the distance.  The rhododendrons were prolific around the walks, birds of many varieties were amazing and colourful and some unique to Bhutan.   We also saw macaque monkeys, yaks, numerous dogs, goats, and farm animals.  There were plenty of opportunities to enjoy the views.  ",
        "The bush camps were truly more than we had expected, set up by a team of wonderful local people.  The tour provided a camp kitchen run by a small team of people for those nights which we camped in the bush.  Breakfasts and dinners at the camp sites were served in a dining tent, with a long table and seating for us all.  Breakfasts were a mixture of Indian and Bhutan style food, including veg and non-veg options, egg dishes, and hot coffee, tea, juices.  Water was always available at camps and in the bus.  ",
        "Good lunches were provided on each day we were hiking, usually at a way-point along the trail, usually with a terrific view of the mountains we were hiking through.   The dinners at the bush camps were very extensive choices, with Indian dishes (including lovely curries), and Bhutanese vegetable dishes, followed by deserts, coffee and tea.   We asked for some beer to be provided at dinner time and this was sold to those persons who wanted it at very reasonable prices.  ",
        "The tents were for 1 or 2 persons and included a very good tent (room for 2 persons), camp stretchers, an underlay for the sleeping bag, a sleeping bag, bag liners, pillows, bedside table, a bed lamp and two recliner chairs set outside.  The tents were set up each evening and packed away in the morning by the Camp/Kitchen crew. There were 2 shower tents, and 2 toilet tents, which provided privacy, and basic ablution needs.  Take some hand cleaner, and some of your own toilet paper (in case of emergencies, at camp or in the bush!).  ",
        "Other accommodation included 2 home stays, as well a modest hotel and a more luxurious resort/hotel.  ",
        "The 2 home stays were wonderful, with some locally grown and prepared foods, in one case in traditional style served and eaten sitting on the carpeted floor of the family’s combined kitchen/living area.  The homestay families were very engaging and created a lovely atmosphere.  The sleeping arrangements were rustic and nice, with all the essential facilities one would expect, with a touch of Bhutanese country style.  One homestay offered home-made spirits made from buck wheat.   Rooms were generally for two, and sometimes more, so expect to share even if you are a couple. One homestay offered a hot-rock spa located next to the local stream, though no-one took up the offer. The hosts were very friendly, informative and interested in our group.  The Homestays were definitely highlights of the tour.  ",
        "The Hotel Kisa Villa in Thimphu was comfortable, and we had a great view of the Fort.  The other major Hotel was the Norbu Lingka Resort in Trongsa was very nice with terrific views over the valley, great food and a well equipped bar.  The final hotel in Paro was the Meeta Resort, which was very comfortable with good food, although it was a 5 minute taxi from town.  ",
        "In addition to the trekking component, we had plenty of sightseeing.  There were a number of wonderful monasteries, and renovated forts from years ago.  We found Trongsa to be a great little town to explore, as was Paro and Thimphu.  The little town of Chen Debi was very interesting, giving an insight into rural life in Bhutan.  ",
        "  ",
        "Another highlight was the Red Panda Café in Bumthang. The café offered two beers made under the Red Panda Label, and the group managed to drink them out of beer within the 2 hours we were there.  They also provided some bar snacks, some light meals, coffee, tea and cakes etc, together with some tourist collectables, all in a lovely environment with a view over the nearby farmland and river.  ",
        "We had an extra 2 days in Paro because of plane connection, so we had an additional hike with Dorji up to Cheleyla Pass (at 3988m Elev.) and to the Nunnery, which was an additional highlight, and more time to explore Paro, which was very enjoyable, finding a nice Momo restaurant and a bar called Park 76, both on the main street.   ",
        "  ",
        "We highly recommend the Bhutan Trek run by G-Adventures.  ",
        "Our guides Dorji and Sangay, and CJ our driver, were excellent. Dorji and Sangay had a tremendous knowledge of Buddhism, the history, natural history, economy and culture of Bhutan.  They would attend to all of our needs, and provided additional help whenever requested.  ",
        "Sangay is a keen bird watcher and was able to locate and name numerous endemic, endangered, and migratory birds, which I was most impressed of, being a bird watcher myself.  I think he converted some of the other hikers to bird watching as well.      ",
        "  ",
        "If you are not aware, travel to Bhutan is strictly controlled by the Bhutan Government to ensure traveller numbers do not exceed a set maximum and to ensure the environmental impact is minimal.  The cost of going to Bhutan is determined by a set minimum spend per person per day = US$200 pppd when we went, although it is very difficult to determine what expenses are included in the required minimum expenditure, e.g. airfares, accommodation, as this is rolled up into the all-up price for the tour.  ",
        "However, there were some issues we experienced because of the layers of booking organisations involved. ",
        "When we received had our trek briefing on the first night in Thimphu the guides had to explain that there were some changes to the itinerary, and a reduction in some days hiking distances.  We also found that there were facilities/services provided by the Tour Company in Bhutan that, if we had known, would have reduced the travel gear we took, e.g. sleeping bags and warm sleeping gear for the cold nights was provided.  However, this information was not spelled out clearly in the brochures, and some people brought sleeping bags, bag liners, and water proofing with them, and some (like us) bought new sleeping bags. ",
        "We understand that the Bhutanese ground staff had given feedback outlining similar comments from hikers from previous tours, but these had not been incorporated into the latest advertising brochures (previous reviews on this platform, if you scroll through, will confirm this comment). ",
        "What became clear to us be the end, was that the tour company people on the ground in Bhutan were not given the opportunity to review the G-Adventures brochures for the trip in Bhutan.  ",
        "The Tour guides were excellent, and endeavored to please us all the way along, and we would definitely recommend Dorji, Sangay and CJ."

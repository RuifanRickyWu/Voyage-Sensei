        "I signed up to TripAdvisor just to leave this review. My 10yo is *all* about planes. I found this company looking for something to do with my son for his birthday. The website is old and the phone sign-up kind of sketchy (no confirmation etc.) but I believe that is ONLY because this is a very small company run by a retired pilot who just wants to share his love of flying. There aren't any employees (maybe his daughter or a part-time assistant on some days? I spoke to a woman on the phone once), but more about this later.",
        "Finding the place in a nondescript industrial park full of similar buildings was a bit of a challenge and the address (401 Magnetic Dr.) is old -- new address is down the street at 616 Magnetic Dr. The industrial park doesn't help because the buildings are numbered strangely. The office and bathroom were clean, as was the room with the flight simulators. We were led into a dark room where there are three actual cockpits from various aircraft. Two were set up for flight simulation; one with a projector (explains the dark room) and the other with three or four monitors for windows. My kids were super excited to get started and the pilot (not an actor remember, an actual retired pilot) was VERY good with two overexcited little boys who had trouble listening because they were in a REAL PLANE. He was patient and helpful and despite what another reviewer says, did not have an accent so heavy that you could not understand him. Yes, there's an accent but if you're actually willing to listen, he's perfectly understandable and has a lot of funny anecdotes and family-friendly jokes to share. It's clear that he loves flying and is enthusiastic to share that with anyone who comes.",
        "The simulators run MS Flight Simulator X -- this is a well-known and fairly well-respected flight simulator software you can actually buy for your own computer (it's even available on Steam) -- this isn't a knock against the business -- you're paying for time on the machines, not the software. You're paying for a real pilot to show you the ropes. Running Flight Sim X on your home computer with a mouse is a lot different from running it in a real cockpit with multiple monitors, genuine controls from real aircraft and surround sound. A similar setup in your home would cost many thousands of dollars. Trust me -- I've looked into this for my young pilot-to-be. Just a single control yoke, set of three levers and flight pedals will run you $400 and it's still nothing like the real thing.",
        "Keep in mind that since these sims are run in a dark room and in real cockpits it is very difficult to get good pictures or videos of the kids when they're actually flying. The pilot will let you know that he's got to take a minute to set up the next scenario so it's a good time for pictures, and one of the simulators (the one with the projector) one of the side windows is removed and you can get an okay angle to film the experience if your camera is good enough to shoot in low light. Do your kids a favour and DO NOT use a flash or external lighting while they're in the sim; they won't be able to enjoy themselves and you'll only end up with crappy pictures or video. You'll have opportunities to take better pictures afterward if you let him know ahead of time.",
        "On that note: since this is pretty much a one-man show you need to manage your expectations appropriately. He can't run the sim and engage the parents at the same time. He will not be able to answer the phone if he's got a client, but he does try to call back if he's got a spare moment between flight runs. The building door will be locked until your flight time. If you want to chit-chat afterward perhaps let him know so he can end the sim a bit early to accommodate pictures or questions. He makes a very real effort to give all of his attention to whomever is in the sim; something any paying customer would appreciate.",
        "One hour will go by VERY fast; it takes a good 15 minutes just to get acquainted with the controls and understand the flight mechanics. I bought two hours, thinking that each kid would have one hour in a sim, but the pilot suggested pairing up and running both boys for two hours. This turned out to be fantastic advice; my boys discovered that in order to make a successful flight they must work together and listen to the pilot's instructions, not just goof around with the controls and bicker at each other. Once they learned that, they really started having some real fun. The pilot was amazing at corralling their youthful energy into their respective jobs in the cockpit. I'm sure it must have been frustrating but he was patient and kind throughout; I was thoroughly impressed with his ability to work with kids.",
        "My sons LOVED this experience, and I found the pilot friendly, knowledgable and charming. I am absolutely going to come back for as long as my kids are interested in flying. This was a great experience and I highly recommend this to anyone who wants to try something different."

        "The bad customer service really started when you have to call to book your time slot. The person never picked up. I would leave messages and the person wouldn't call back. Finally, I called and he did pick up and was promptly told that he doesn't normally pick up \"unknown callers\" and that I was lucky. Annoyed, but just wanting to get this overwith, I booked a 7pm time. On the day I was to arrive, he calls me and says he's made a mistake and if I can come for 6pm, he mentions that he shouldn't book times without looking at his schedule. His office phone appeared to be his cell phone. We showed up early and the place was literally closed and dark. It was in an industrial area. I thought the guy forgot. So at 6pm he turns on the lights and opens the door. He asks for the tax payment and states he only takes cash. Further annoyed now, I say to him, why he didn't mention this in the Groupon? Anyway, he calmed things down and we went to the back where the simulators are. They are older and have really old software. I put on a good face for my son, but I couldn't wait to get out of this place with this condescending owner."

        "Went with kid to Flightmaster. Got a deal online.  Basically, Microsoft Flight Simulator in Russia airplane cockpit. We got the smaller of the two cockpits, the other being a passenger plane.  We flew multiple simulations in various aircraft types.  With the cockpit windscreen projected the simulation, the on-board radar was also connected the simulation, so give it a truer feel along with the cockpit controls that acted as simulator controls.  Cockpit does not move with the simulation.  Kid enjoyed it very much, and I liked it too.  Space was interesting, lots of model airplanes and artifacts in the hanger room.  You can obviously do Flight Simulator at home, but the real cockpit feel is just so much fun."

We flew 4 different types of commercial aircraft and I was impressed how they each handled differently. This gives you a very good idea just how busy your flight crew are when they are taking you away on your vacation. WOW.",

        "The cockpit is from an authentic older commercial aircraft. You operate the actual proper knobs and buttons. There is no movement (shaking, pitching) while flying but it is a great entry level experience for non-pilots. Landing these things is a lot harder than it looks."

I thought it was actually going to be a realistic simulation, with good graphics, movement, vibration. It was the complete opposite. The best part of the flight session was when the captain said our time was up!!  Oh and the captain also lacked hygiene. I suggest you bring a mint to offer him because he will be talking right over you."

        "Bought a groupon, paid for the higher tier so we can have 4 people play this game , turned out that the 'plane' is really small ,we all thought that it would be at least an enclosed unit with motion like it would shake if the plane turns or crashes ...anyway , walked in , the girl greeted us in a proper manner , but the captain ignored us and avoid eye contact.",
        "So Captain came in , told the kids to claw inside to the seats , with no 'welcome' or is this your first time or any type of introduction , he just gave instructions to the kids and start the computer game , English is hard to understand , not much interactions with the kids on the seats never mind the 2 of us who were supposed to be seating behind them ..(the 'plane' is so small , no way for us to even get in ) so me and my wife just sat outside of the 'plane' and wait....",
        "At the end I asked the Captain to take a picture WITH us , he misunderstood it and took a picture FOR all of us , sure, great idea , then I asked again to take picture WITH him , guess what  ?   ......he pointed to his wrist (with no watch) and just walked out !    WTF ?",
        "What is worse is that ,fine , if my time was up and the next party was coming in, I would understand , but the Captain was just sitting there the same way when we walked in , relaxed , don't care ... he then showed me the terms and conditions on the groupon that tax and tips are not included , I repeat, he was showing me the text that he highlighted on the paper , implying ' you HAVE to pay me a tip , it is black and white ! '",
        "So I gave the girl a $20 bill , both herself and the Captain were strugging to get me change (not even attempted) as if they are not a business unit at all , so I told them to keep the change , they both all of a sudden lightened up with big smiles etc like you would have expected as soon as you walked in BEFORE the game (and the tips)",

When I wasn't following their adventures, there was an extensive collection of memorabilia and toys to look at.  Their instructor was very helpful and enthusiastic!",
        "Just a few caveats:",
        "1. In the fine print of a Groupon certificate is a notice that taxes and gratuities are extra.  This is unfortunate if you are buying the session as a gift, because the participant pays the taxes!  Not only did we have to pay cash because their credit card machine was \"down\", but they didn't have appropriate change.",
        "2. It was very warm in the facility, with no apparent air conditioning.  It was about 20C outdoors, but felt like 25-26C indoors.  However, the cockpit had some kind of fan in it for the participants, and my family had no further complaints.  Note to owner: the heat is not good for the electronics.",
        "3. Be prepared to wait outdoors until your session starts, as the receptionist is also a session operator.  I wouldn't want to leave my front office unattended either!",
        "4. As for those gratuities, they don't \"expect\" them, but then they have a pretty flashy tip tray in the reception area.  I have never seen it suggested that tips might be appropriate for most entertainment facilities, however our instructor insisted they are providing a service just like waitresses.  I wonder if she ever tipped one of her own instructors?  My issues with gratuities could fill a book, so I let it go.  To her credit, my protest didn't seem to reduce her enthusiasm and professionalism one iota.",

We got to sit in and control a professional flight simulator, I decided to let my younger brother have a little more fun and I took the co-pilot seat! We were very excited to be able to sit in a real cockpit and use all the controls without fear of crashing and burning.. haha.",

It was a bit of fun but I agree with another reviewer that it's nothing above the computer game that my son plays.  Sure you have some gadgets to play with here but not enough to make it seem real.  The screens are up above your head which made it less realistic to me as well.  I guess I was expecting a lot more realism.  ",
        "We arrived at our appointment time and were immediately ushered into the simulator. We weren't given a tour and nobody approached us to explain or show us their collection of miniature aircrafts.  The instructor was friendly but kept grabbing the controls when my son and I were not flying correctly.  I felt like we weren't allowed to make mistakes.  We had to land correctly every time no matter what.  It is just a game after all so I didn't see the point in that. The other reviewer is right in that both the pilot and co-pilot controls do the exact same thing at the same time so essentially only one person is really flying at a time.  This didn't really bother me though since I was happy to let my son do most of the flying since I bought the voucher for him to enjoy anyway.  ",
        "If you use a deal-find voucher (WagJag, or Groupon etc) you DO have to pay the taxes (ours stated so on the voucher so that wasn't a surprise) but we were told AFTER our simulator experience that it's CASH ONLY.  I had to run to the bank and come back.  They'd be better off telling people that beforehand as a less honest person might not bother coming back!",

I have been in aviation for 25 years, and done everything from fly to manage a major carrier. (Airline for milandralove) the toys she refers to are actually collector models and factory demos, some worth probably more than the pervious reviewer makes in a year. Secondly, I'm not sure what she expected except maybe a flight on the Concorde. Enough about this nitpicker.",
        " Captain Val was very colorful and informative with a unique style of educating and instructing. Kind of like the old Soviet ladies we think of yelling at us to do something. Given his aviation experiance, which was easily proven by his documents and letters on display, I took it as a honour to be trained by him and a lovely young lady and another very seasoned pilot named Eugene I believe. I don't think there is anywhere else in North America you could find an actual soviet era training aircraft with crew! It was not a 2 million dollar sim at CAE, but for the value and uniqueness, worth every dime. Apparently the company has some major league airlines helping out as well with promotions. Captain Val and his staff are real-world airline people who don't pad the reality of what flying and the business is like. I had a great time as did my wife and son, also training to be a pilot.",

        "We each took a turn and I quickly realized that this is definately not a simulator.  It is just a video game being played while you sit in a cockpit of sorts.  The pilots wheel is connected to the co pilots wheel so only one person at a time really gets to play.  After each game (which took about 2 min) we were told to \"swap out\".  ",

Would have been much more helpful to explain how to play prior to doing that.  She also grabbed the wheel from both of the kids and took over for them then simply let go and said \"you do it\".",

As I had brought the actual voucher with me I asked her to show me where it said this.  She couldn't find it on the voucher and said all the other WagJag's had it (not sure what that had to do with out dealfind voucher).  I told her that it also said that we would get a 1 hr flight simulation and we didn't.  She said that we did - we just had to swap out.

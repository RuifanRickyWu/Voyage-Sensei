        "This was our first time doing an escape room and this one was certainly very fun.  Because we a fans of the TV show, it made it all the more engaging.  The addition of two actors in the game also added a wonderful element to the experience.  The puzzles were challenging and you definitely had to work as a team to see how all the clues fit.  I really didn't think we were going to figure it out.  With less than 2 minutes to go, we managed to solve the mystery and help Murdoch escape imminent death!  At the end, the  actors told us that less than 10% of the groups are able to solve the game so we felt really good about that!  All in all, definitely well organized and highly recommended."

        "My family treated me, a devoted Murdoch fan, to this afternoon adventure as a Christmas gift. The timing was perfect as we scheduled it for the week after the airing of the 200th episode (which was an ideal refresher of plots and characters from past episodes). The actors who guided us through the mystery were attentive, funny, engaged and helpful, and they encouraged collaborative (rather than competitive) problem-solving. The setting in the Casa Loma Coachman's house is ideal for this period piece. There were a few activities where some knowledge of the series was helpful, but it is not essential. I noticed that younger guests, and those who had participated in mystery room events before, were at an advantage when it came to suspending disbelief, diving in, and just going with the flow. Despite my more advanced age (!) I managed to solve one of the key clues for this mystery. I had a wonderful time and would recommend this as a fun experiential gift for any group, Murdoch fans or not."

They were able to give hints when needed which kept an exciting pace to the game. Regardless we failed to complete it, but we got close and I understand that this is a particularly difficult game. ",

We were concerned having only played a number of escape rooms with a maximum of 7 people and all were friends. It adds an interesting challenge! Although I still think my preference would be to play with people we know. ",
        "Finally, this escape room by far has been one of the most well thought out and carefully crafted experiences, with its amazing location, challenging puzzles and interesting interactions with live actors, we don’t know what else they could have done to enhance this activity further. So much so, we couldn’t help but book another escape room! "

Our family was joined by a few others and we enjoyed the group dynamics, getting to know a few others, each having something different to contribute. I think we would have been overwhelmed if we had been just on our own. The actors did an effective job of enhancing the experience. Now I'm not sure what I'd think of doing a room where there is no cast! Kudos to planners, designers, and participants. Thanks for a great time!"

        "This is my 3rd escape room game, but my first in Canada. As a fan of the show this is based on, it was really fun. My friends had never watched the show but were able to do just fine. It's not a requirement. Good twists and turns. We needed a bit more time - maybe 10 mins or so - and we would've escaped. The only negative is that there are so many moving parts that it's easy to lose track of time just trying to solve a puzzle or 2. The group I was in totaled 11, so that helped a bit. Can't imagine just 6 people (minimum required) solving everything in an hour. Perhaps if they were all friends. It was a bit challenging working with so many strangers. At first, small groups formed to work on the mini puzzles. Everything fell off at the end when we all had to come together to solve the last puzzle. Lots of panic and unnecessary shouting. Would've loved to have won, as it was my birthday. The game was advertised as being 90 minutes but was only 60 minutes. If it was actually 90 mins or even 75, we would've escaped the room. Overall, still a great time. Highly recommend. Do it with calm, level-headed friends and family if you can!"

LOVE the theatrical aspect, and the two actors involved in our session were excellent - the latter gave us hints in creative ways when we needed them. Even though we didn't completely solve the mystery by the end, we felt as if we had been super-close and we all had a lot of fun. There was a good mix of puzzle types, too (observational, deductive, etc.) so that no one felt left out...the actors helped a great deal with the latter as well. Highly recommended."

As far as escape experiences go this wasn't our favourite but that comes down to personal preference and not the quality of this game itself, which was excellent. Since you're in such a large group (in our case, all strangers, but nice ones) there isn't the same amount of understanding what's going on as there is with smaller rooms but there are definitely enough puzzles for everyone to work on alone or in small groups. Just be prepared to not know how your group came to certain solutions or where that key came from unless you can be everywhere at once. Definitely worth experiencing though. "

While we didn't manage to escape, we all had a blast and will definitely try the other Secret city Adventures' escape rooms in the future!

About half of us had done escape rooms before. For those that hadn't, this escape room certainly sets the bar high for others they may do in future... There were lots of puzzles to solve, so it was easy to find something to work on either independently or in small groups. The puzzles were fun and varied, and took us to the very end our alotted time. The accompanying actors were great, and provided a fun twist and an overall better immersive experience than other escape rooms. Highly recommend this Murdoch Mystery escape room!"

It was our first escape room with live actors and they made it that much more fun. There were a lot of interesting puzzles to solve, as one would expect in a Detective Murdoch mystery.

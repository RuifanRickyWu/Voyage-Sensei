        "The most recent of my numerous stays in Toronto was on August 23rd and 24th of this year, when I came down to see the Canadian National Exhibition. During this stay, I decided to investigate Sunnyside Park on Lake Shore Boulevard, which had been my mother's favorite playground as a child. Much to my pleasure, I found the park to be just as lovely and peaceful as Mom had always described it! The old Sunnyside Carnival is now, unfortunately, only a memory, but the park proper still featured just about everything you could ask for enjoying a sunny afternoon: plenty of shady picnic area, including several pavilions; numerous small playgrounds scattered throughout the park (I LOVED the concrete dinosaurs!); an Olympic-sized swimming pool and two children's wading pools with fountains; several in-park commercial eateries, including a barbecue shack and a pizza kiosk which also sold the most delicious custard cones; a boardwalk, jogging trails, an old-fashioned dance hall (not open at the time I was there), and much more! Best of all was Sunnyside Beach, adjacent to the park: a \"wild\" beach which I fell head over heels in love with, pebble-lined shoreline and all!! Beautiful water, almost glass-smooth with the shallowest of waves, due to a beach-length fishing pier several hundred yards from shore; nice velvety sand to walk on in the water once you get past the pebbles, at about a three-foot depth;  and best of all, an incredible assortment of wild waterfowl, including - I couldn't believe my eyes - a family of wild Trumpeter swans!!! Mom and Pop were unbelievably beautiful, whiter than snow, all grace and serenity once they waded into the water; their four chicks were half-grown, covered with shaggy grey feathers and totally adorable! Along with the swans were dozens of Canadian geese in various growth stages, from half-grown chicks to adults, all making a pleasant racket - and, of course, the ever-present seagulls, many of whom were diving offshore and actually seemed to be fishing - that was the first time I'd ever actually seen gulls fish! All in all, I LOVED Sunnyside Beach and Park - I can't wait to see it again next summer!! (P.S. - the Four Points by Sheraton Hotel on Lake Shore Boulevard is directly across the street from Sunnyside - tourists with children might want to keep that in mind when deciding on a hotel!)"

[lockers just 25cents] Its incredibly close to Queen Street West [the Roncesvalles side] and was minutes away from our hotel. There was several dozen Dragon Boats out from the Sunnyside Paddling Club as well... it was great to watch them in action. I will be back!"

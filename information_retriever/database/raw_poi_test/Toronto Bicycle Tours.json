It was a small group, just three other tourists and myself, which meant we travelled at a good pace from start to finish.  Ryan gave clear instructions through his hand signals so I always knew when to turn left or right and stop, because of that I felt safe cycling on the main roads with the traffic.   Ryan also made sure we had plenty of water and even had granola bars if we wanted a snack, which I thought was a nice addition.  I would do it again. 5*****"

Our tour included a ferry ride over and back.  While touring the islands we saw historical markers, beautiful beaches and a lighthouse from the 1800’s.  Our guide, Sydney was was knowledgeable and funny. She even had a ghost story up her sleeve. The tour was not difficult at all and the bike trails and lanes made even the most cautious rider feel secure.  We went in September and had a cloudy day and the tour was still very enjoyable. Would highly recommend a bike tour of the Toronto Islands"

Sydney, our guide was friendly and knowledgeable and guided us with skill through city traffic (before and after the ferry) and we were able to spend ample time at each feature on the island, have our questions answered, and since we had a bit of extra time before the ferry we (with the two other people on our tour who were delightful) have a quick treat at one of the island's outside coffee shops. Choosing the morning ride was nice because as we finished the ferry seemed to drop of A LOT of people, we enjoyed the island almost to ourselves as it was early morning on a weekday.  EXCELLENT experience and value!"

As the beginning of the trip was early on a Sat morning, we did not have any trouble navigating through the streets of Toronto at the start. Ferry rides to and fro from the island were seamless.  Tour of the island was so-so.  There were a few antidotes that were interesting, but the majority of the tour was the same information we had read about online prior to the trip.  The return bike trip from the ferry to the office was a little nerve racking as the traffic was heavy.  We felt that our guide (Katelyn?) should have been more cautious and stopped at some of the intersections to wait for everyone to catch up.  We would have liked a more experienced and professional guide.  If we were to bicyle on the island again, I would just take the ferry there and rent the bikes there too.  For the price, it wasn't worth having a guide.  Just read up on the island first."

After fitting and testing the well equipped bikes in the underground parking garage we hit the very busy streets of Toronto, still suffering a bit from the floods of a few days before. We headed out to the ferry terminal while sightseeing the area around the CN tower and the old Powerplant. The tempo was perfect for everyone. Just before boarding the ferry we got a talk about what we would be about to see. They ferry itself gives you a prime view on the city skyline while the landing smaller planes come over head. It takes about 10 to 15 minutes to cross the water and debark on the Islands. Starting from Hanlan’s Point we drove the Island across with multiple stops & a very solid guide on the how’s and why’s of the Toronto Islands. We were given the most beautiful sunset from the residential Algonquin island overlooking the city skyline. After one more stop we reached the ferry and our way back to the shop. 3 hours, 15km and a ton of pictures and information later we said our goodbyes after taking a group selfie. A lot of fun and beautiful on a Thursday evening. Highly recommended."

Sylvia was gracious, patient, and just provided an outstanding tour. Her knowledge of not only the islands, but of Toronto proper was extraordinarily on point and interesting. There were only six of us on the tour, and she made each one of us fell as if we were the most important person in the world. ",
        "Sylvia by far is the best tour guide that we’ve had in a long time, and my brother and myself, and my sister-in-law have gone on many Bike tours. Back to the tour, if you love bike riding and ferries and interesting facts you’re going to love this tour. We went from the downtown area of Toronto to the ferry, landing to the islands of Toronto all in 3 1/2 hours and I could tell you it was not whirlwind, but it was satisfying. I highly recommend this tour and if it all possible you should specifically ask for, Sylvia"

        "Everything about it was lovely. Consuela our toir guide was lovely, caring, friendly and very knowledgeable. She took pictures of each stop. We visited so many places that we would not have seen. Bikes were really nice and easy to ride with plenty of gears. Water and granola bars were complimentary, which was great as it was so warm. We had 3 hours and got to see so much of Toronto. Pictures were taken by our tour guide and tjen sent to us on email complimentary. Thanks Consuela "

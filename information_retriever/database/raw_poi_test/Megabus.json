I was excited for the trip and just wanted to relax and be driven; but I guess I will just take my car - which is about the same price in gas for 1 person (so for 2 there is no competition).",

        "Last Wednesday, my bf and I wanted to visit Niagara Falls and booked a trip from Toronto with Megabus. Early in the morning, we were at the station to board. But unfortunately our tickets were not valid for that day but the week after (when we’re already back in Europe).",
        "We asked the Megabus service lady at the station who could not help us but told us to contact Megabus customer service online. Which we did. The first response was quick and included links to “trade-in” our tickets. So we were looking forward to having our trip on that day still. But this trade in thing was very expensive (about the price that we already paid or even more on top). So this was not an affordable option for us. Later we wanted to take a look for the next day but the “trade in” did not work anymore. I explained that unlucky situation to customer service many times and kindly asked for a refund. A cancellation should be possible, at least when the trip is one week ahead and still other people could book those tickets and go on that trip. But for Megabus it’s not possible. They offered a code that I could use within one year, but it does not make sense since it’s not valid where I’m from and I won’t return to Canada any time soon. So that’s it. I regret that I haven’t checked those reviews here before I booked.",

He was acting dismissive and unprofessional when my girlfriend asked a simple question about the bus stops, responding with aggressive and sarcastic. ",

There are two bus stops in Niagara Falls, and we simply wanted to confirm we were at the right one. His behaviour made the ride and our trip uncomfortable and stressful as this bad experience impacted our trip towards Niagara Falls as tourists and especially towards my girlfriend. ",
        "As paying customers, the way he treated us was beyond unacceptable, and it felt as though he might have had something against customers with Asian descent.",

She looked already moody and told me no it’s not, told me I need to go on the queue to the left of her even though I told her Niagara Falls and the bus behind her was for Niagara Falls. So then I queue on this other side only to find that it was a queue for a bus to America and then this same moody woman gets in the Niagara Falls bus with the driver and drives off. Use GO next time or some other transportation company, Megabus are a waste of money and time."

        "I just experienced a Megabus nightmare. I had made a reservation, and paid for a seat choice, both ways to/from Pearson Airport traveling from Kingston. Going I was stuck on some bus, that only had two seats available (neither being the seat I paid extra for) to go to Pearson. I left my self enough time at both ends to assure my getting to and from Pearson on time. Traffic was so bad I had to get off Megabus at Union station and make my way the airport using another mode of transportation. I do not know TO but made it to the airport with little time to spare thanks with the help of a young lady from TO. Coming home I stood outside at Pearson where the buses pick up customers for several hours waiting for Megabus to show up at the airport. Never did. I had to make my own way back to Union station and catch a via train back home. When I finally connected with a human customer service rep I was made to feel like I was lying and told the bus was there. I cut Megabus some slack on the first part as I did, even with a lot of trouble, not miss my plane to the UK. But to end my trip with no bus, and no way to contact Megabus to inquire why the bus was not where Megabus  said on my confirmation sheet it to be was the straw that broke the camels back. I came back on the 31st and just yesterday customer service sent me an email that basically said I was wrong and they were right. I will never use them again, and my advice to those trying to make a flight and want to book Megabus to get them there...don't."

        "My mom, an elderly woman, bought a ticket from the town we live in to Toronto not realizing the bus went to the Toronto airport, which is where she was going. When we noticed that, we tried to: (i) change her ticket (it was too late); or (ii) purchase a ticket for the other lag of the journey (TO downtown to TO airport) but you cannot buy tickets from downtown TO to the TO airport. My mother asked the employee if she could stay on the bus to complete her journey (instead of having to transfer to the UP train), the answer was a curt \"not unless you have the right ticket\".",
        "I know it was not a seating issue, because it was not possible to purchase a ticket for that second lag. It was purely because they charge more than double to go the extra half an hour to the airport... And we would have paid it, if we could have.",

        "They don't do refunds/cancellations but it took forever for the website to let me change my reservation. When I emailed customer service, they only told me how to purchase a new ticket. My old ticket was about $20 more than the new one I changed it to, but not only did they not cover the difference, they made me pay $15 out of pocket to change my reservation in the first place (well in advance). They charge $7 to do it with your phone. They pull so much money out of you in additional fees and they charge $3.99 just to book a ticket with them. You can't even select a seat ahead of time unless it's a particular one. I paid an extra $15 when the difference on my old ticket would've covered it, but they made me pay it out of pocket anyway, when I already paid approx. $100 for the first one. They also only refund a credit, and give you 10 mins to use the credit to pay for a new ticket. It's crazy that I had to pay more when my credit was more than the new ticket. Guess I'll try to not have a family emergency next time."

        "I normally do not leave any type of reviews, but I would not wish this on my worst enemy. Paid $160 for a roundtrip from Toronto to Niagara Falls (3x people), the morning bus was fine. The wifi was not working even though they said there would be wifi. The bus arrived on time in the morning, thought it was all fine. Then in the evening we had paid for a trip back ticket at approximately 9:15 PM. We arrived at the location by 8:45 PM, even though they said you only have to be there 15 min in advance, we wanted to be early just in case. ",
        "9:15 comes around. No bus. We check the tracking website and it said delayed by a few minutes. Few minutes turned into a few more, and a few more, and MANY more. We were waiting for OVER an hour. We stopped waiting because the tracking site changed to “NO LONGER TRACKABLE.” ",
        "We were shocked, because we KNEW we did not miss it. We were there early and there was 10+ other people waiting for Megabus with us. THE BUS NEVER CAME!!! NEVER!!, WE WERE THERE UNTIL 11 PM (ALMOST 2 HOURS), also it was very late and no other busses came until 11 so we had no choice but to wait for whatever would come. We called but they did NOT have 24/7 costumer service. We had to pay for another bus, which was so expensive because we bought the tickets last minute so I think the prices were higher. We had to pay an ADDITIONAL $130 (3x people) for the other bus that came at 11 PM (not a Megabus), and this was only for a one way trip, 160 is more but that was supposed to be for two trips.",
        "They did not try to notify us by ANY means, they could have at least emailed us(MINIMUM). Also Uber would have costed $200+ all the way to Toronto. They refunded our tickets tho, but that’s still a horrible experience, because what if the other random bus never showed up? We would have literally had no way to get home. Never getting a Megabus ever again. The refund took 7 days, which is fine i gues but that service was still horrible. If i was someone travelling to Canada/newcomer and had this experience I would be very scared and worried."

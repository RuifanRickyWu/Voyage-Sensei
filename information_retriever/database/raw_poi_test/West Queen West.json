The museum’s collections are diverse and offer something for everyone, I highly recommend adding it to your itinerary."

I had to call out the window to a passerby to tell someone in the hotel I was trapped! When they came and got me out, they offered me another room, but stated that a repairman would be up to fix the door that day! I was supposed to be out for the day, and not expected back until after 11 PM. I returned early, found out none of the promised work had been done, so I packed up and changed rooms! This one had \"no\" AC, and the windows were sealed, couldn't open them! No garbage can in this room, but I could get out!",

I explained this to the receptionists and he did not apologise nor give a damn we said we can’t stay here. All they care about is that they’re still getting the money. I asked the receptionist (who seemed to be way too relaxed and uncaring) how to get my money back and he said hotels.com. On contacting them they advised we needed to talk to the manager then and there, no other way to get money back, we had already left Canada by this point as they ruined the city for us. If you have children or do not want to be in a place filled with the smell of marijuana do not stay here! I’m so shocked at the treatment of the service from hotels.com and west queen west."

This block is apparently becoming known as 'Vegandale', so vegans might want to make a point of visiting this block.

You can find some real strange and exotic items in the 50's style furniture and gift stores and in some of the antique shops.  You will never go hungry because there are numerous restaurants.

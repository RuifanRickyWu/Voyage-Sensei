  "description": "One of the top international ballet companies, The National Ballet of Canada was founded in 1951 by Celia Franca. A company of 70 dancers with its own orchestra, the National Ballet has been led by Artistic Director Karen Kain, one of the greatest ballerinas of her generation, since 2005. Renowned for its diverse repertoire, the company performs traditional full-length classics, embraces contemporary work and encourages the creation of new ballets as well as the development of Canadian choreographers.",

        "I was looking for something my partner and I could do over the holiday break that was fun and shake off the rust a little bit when I found this class! I swear my phone is listening to me sometimes because things like these always seem to pop up online right after I finish talking about them. The class was so worth it though, and Marion is the sweetest instructor ever. My partner and I had no dance experience before and she taught us all we needed to know. If you do sign up for Marion’s class, make sure you have a good partner. The tango is meant to be a two-person dance, and if your partner isn’t engaged, like mine wasn’t unfortunately, then it will be hard when you do your final performance. I can’t recommend this class enough though. "

I had seen Swan Lake many times while growing up-of course watching Karen Kain and I was able to obtain her autograph. Well sadly no Karen Kain to meet after the show this time, my wonderful husband and I were able to enjoy a wonderful performance. The costumes and scenery moved in ways that enhanced the movement of the dancers. Overall a beautiful experience. We will be back indeed. ",
        "You may want to have a better dress code for evening performances. While people were dressed all very differently from a tux to torn shorts and flip flops there is something to be said to dress up for the artists and have a  nighty on the town. This would also likely end the many arguments we heard young couples having where one partner felt the other was undressed. You are not likely to lose patrons if you enforce/encourage a code. :)"

        "I have attended the ballet regularly for many years and been an annual supporter as well. I am so saddened to see that I will no longer feel welcome again. When an establishment chooses to exclude people from participating in their service just because they can I think it is discriminatory.  When there is no scientific evidence to support the notion that one group of people pose a greater risk to others, than any other group and in fact that notion is irrational, the voluntary choice to refuse entry is discriminatory.  You may not feel it is significant because fear mongering has influenced your view along the way.  But anyone who lives discrimination knows how strong the power to persuade is and how willing those who want to protect their own privilege are to exclude anyone who challenges it it any way. I am truly disappointed that many artistic establishments have chosen to discriminate.  It has to be wrong no matter how much it feels justified.   If we haven’t learned that yet then what needs to happen before we do?"

        "The James Kudelka's version is absolutely different than versions, you can see in Europe. The story is set in 19th century Russia. The first act is so nice! Showing a celebration of Christmas in a large village barn was a wonderful idea. (Normally this act takes place in a big room with a Christmas tree.)",
        "I liked the dance of Bears and the Horse, cannon firing confetti into the audience - another lovely idea. The Sugar Plum Fairy appeared on the stage in a huge golden Fabergé egg, the Snow Queen danced not only with Snow Flakes but with two men - Icicles, dance of the Waiters was simply amazing! Flower Waltz showes a Bee flying in the meadow from flower to flower.",
        "I really loved all the costumes. Santo Loquasto did a great job on them. Dancers were great, Koto Ishihara as the Sugar Plum Fairy (it was her debut that day) was so beautiful and I really appreciated her ballet technique. ",

The NBOC’s version is not the traditional one that you can see most every company perform but rather a more ethereal and dreamy version. My favourite parts are the opening with the set of a barn rather than in a house and the faberge egg in the second act where the sugar plum fairy emerges for her dance. The theatre is nice and comfortable with ample legroom even for a tall guy like me. Well worth a stop while in Toronto."

        "This was our fourth visit to experience the National Ballet of Canada's Nutcracker ballet (the first at the former O'Keefe Theatre, 3 in the Four Seasons Centre). Box seats are a real treat, you can stretch out, move your chair to whatever position you like. The Four Seasons Centre is a gem, outstanding acoustics and visually stunning. Last year we skipped the National Ballet Nutcracker live and instead saw the Bolshoi version at the movie theatre. We thought that version was very bland and tired. The National Ballet version is fun, colourful and just warms your heart. Even if you never thought you'd like a ballet, who cannot resist dancing mice, bears and even a horse. Such a delight to see so many children attending, exposed to such an excellent cultural experience. Kudos to the National Ballet for the acknowledgement of being on First Nations lands. A wonderful Christmas experience for any family, instead of purchasing material gifts that may be forgotten in a few months. Just a wonderful afternoon."

I haven't bought any of the partially obstructed view tickets yet so I'm no sure about those, but the rest have all been great."

        "This was such an awesome experience! My wife and I received free tickets to 'Alice's Adventures in Wonderland' Dress Rehearsal ballet. I've never been to a ballet before so I definitely wanted the experience! I wasn't sure what to expect. I have been through part of the facility before because it is linked to the Osgoode subway station which is a very convenient way to get there as well as it being extremely handicapped accessible for all sizes of scooters and wheelchairs. It seems to be a very large building with high ceilings and lots of open space. Everything feels like a work of art from the art that is on display to the glass walls, open concept stairs, piano, to the main auditorium with exquisite wood work on the chairs, walls, floors, and banisters. I didn't know if the ballet was like a play where the actors spoke so it was interesting when I realized they were just going to dance and you had to figure out the story from their body language and the awesome, awesome, awesome orchestra. I was very happy to see they left the orchestra pit open during the whole performance so I could watch the musicians as well as the athletes performing. I thought this would be an excellent way for a group such as Circque du Soleil to perform as well.The story was mostly familiar with some surprises along the way. I've seen various movies of Alice in Wonderland but don't remember some of the adventures portrayed here. I've included pictures below. Really the only issue I had was options of food and drinks. A little pricey and could have been healthier choices. I would have liked popcorn actually. lol"

We have seen the performance many times before, and it never gets stale.  The orchestra was superb.  The dancing was great, with Sonia Rodrigues dancing as the Sugar Plum Fairy.  She is so elegant and precise….I was mesmerized.  The stage props were wonderful, with the rat crossing the stage and the prancing horse!  It is a wonderful production for all ages.  We also have to say that we loved the mini Coke bottles that one could purchase as a refreshment, and the Rose Reisman catering assorted mini-sandwiches….very tasty.  After the performance, we bought a Nutcracker and a Nutcracker Christmas ornament.  We went out for dinner afterwards.  It was a real treat for all.  Will we return?  Absolutely!

        "The set design and the costumes were eye-popping beautiful.  The ballet is a series of well-choreographed ensemble dances.  There were many festive special effects that worked, such as a dancing bear on roller skates and an amazing horse on stage (was it real or costume?).  Just do not look for the magical Christmas coming-of-age story of Clara; her nutcracker prince engages with a pas de deux with another woman and the whole production fizzles out with a farcical food fight."

        "Went to an evening performance - so glad I could get tickets! Much appreciated the Ballet Talk by Peter Ottmann, the Senior Ballet Master, at 6:45 - well worth attending. He explained the ballet as ‘representation’ of a particular moment in Nijinsky’s life: his last performance. Founded upon details derived from extensive research, particularly iconic gestural motifs captured in photographs, the ballet touches upon significant moments and performances in the life of this world renowned star. John Neumeier’s selected score is beautiful and presented by the National Ballet Orchestra (Chopin, Schumann, Shostakovich). On from November 22-26, 2017. With matinee and evening Performances. Tickets online and at the Box Office. ",
        "Convenient access from the Four Seasons Performing Arts Centre subway access at Osgoode (Queen Street) station so you don’t have to brave the cold! Convenient preorder of intermission refreshments saves time at the 20 minute intermission. Bars at all levels. Coat check on lower level. "

        "I was looking forward to seeing this ballet and though visually gorgeous and with some very effective music, the choreography was a real let down.It felt very \"50's TV\" dancing. Insubstantial with lots of mediocre leaping about and running around that we've all seen a thousand times before. This work certainly did not strain the technical virtuosities of Canada's great ballet company. It felt quite long and there are repetitive and tedious passages that would benefit muchly from elimination. Disappointing."

        "Though many may feel that ballet and opera are elitist and of no interest, how can you argue with an art form that has survived for a hundred or two hundred years? The National Ballet of Canada is a national treasure and something that everyone should experience at least once. And the most accessible and fun ballet has to be the Nutcracker, for all ages. Saw the New Year's Eve and final 2016 performance and what a wonderful afternoon. Just spectacular dancing and top notch music from the orchestra. A visual treat and a complete escape from real life. The Four Seasons Centre adds to the experience, felt almost pampered, what a great venue."

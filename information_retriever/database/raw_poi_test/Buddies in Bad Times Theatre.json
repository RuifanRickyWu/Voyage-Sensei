  "description": "Established in 1979, this \"gay, lesbian and queer\" theater company produces edgy and provocative new Canadian works. Their work is not for everyone (the list of upcoming productions identifies shows that are \"not for the faint of heart,\" and they mean it), but Buddies produces shows that you simply won't see anywhere else. The theater also stages Canadian adaptations of some well-known works, such as Ibsen's Hedda Gabler. American Sky Gilbert has helped build the theater's cutting-edge reputation.",

        "This was my first visit to this theatre, and I was generally impressed. My chair was not particularly comfortable, but I had lots of leg room. The play, Bremen Town, was experimental but interesting, and also worth noting because it gave good parts to four senior actors, Oliver Dennis, Deborah Grover, Nancy Palk and William Webster."

The story was touching but without the impressive performances of all of the actors in the ensamble it would have been uniteresting. Instead these mostly very young actors were excellent. I cried and laught. Would go back in hope to get another mindblowing experience any day!"

The staff were great and we were treated to our first drinks :-)  By 11.30pm the place was getting busy and come midnight it was wall to wall dancing.",

But not a lot of visitors know that Buddies in Bad Times Theatre turns its space into a nightclub each Friday & Saturday night after 10:30-11pm. It's a nice change from the massive club anthems played at FLY.",
        "I'd recommend Saturday nights. It's probably the most fun crowd in Toronto. It's a pretty young crowd. Mostly 19-30 aged. Not much drama. Just a group looking to have fun with friends and \"buddies\" to dance and Top 40 music.",

Buddies in Bad Times is a very versatile space nestled in the Church-Wellesley Gay Village in Toronto.  It supports young artists with a variety of play festivals and has a great, intimate theatre space in which to do so.  It was also one of the first gay clubs I went to as a gay teenager in Toronto, and I can't remember ever having had more fun.  The music on a Saturday night is always fun and current, the dance floor is full of sweaty, happy people... you can't go wrong!"

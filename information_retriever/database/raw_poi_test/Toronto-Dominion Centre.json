The underground system is fantastic and makes the walking distance which is lined with every imaginable retail and service including restaurants and food courts, feel so much shorter. It probably took me longer to do this walk as I found myself window shopping both directions."

Not that much has changed excepting many taller towers have gone up since.  I was employed on the 47th floor which felt like being in the clouds and it was a pleasure to go to work in such a beautiful place.  The reception area is on the ground floor headed by almost stewardesses directing you to wherever you need to be.  A large bank in the main area  of the building and in the basement a very nice eating place and pub along with post-office, hairdresser, flower shop, chemist and cafes.  There is a beautiful restaurant on the 54th floor which is the top of the building and this feels like you are dining in the clouds.  Working in there I never had to leave the building as in the suites above were dentists, doctors, lawyers, anything you required.  I feel quite honoured to have worked in such a beautiful place."

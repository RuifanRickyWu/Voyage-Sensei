        "Okay, I'm old school. Way back when, a half dozen people could look at a mall map at the same time, find where they were, and where the store they were looking for is, figure out the direction, and be on there way in a matter of a few seconds. Now, with the interactive map, one person at a time can enter the name of the store they're looking for, and  then a description of the store pops up. (This is a great feature since many times I've known the name of the store I was specifically going to, but didn't know what they sell). Then some strange graphic pops up to tell you what level you are on, with lines going showing where the store is. The lines don't have any real reference to direction, nor do they actually show where you are nor the store you're looking for, so at this point most people look away from the map and try to look if they are able to see the store they are looking for. After some time of looking at the map, and then up and down the mall, they move on, and the process is repeated for the next person trying to find their way. Honestly, I gound it faster to walk through the entire mall to find my destination. ",

Because it's central it's easy to pop out of as well if you want to leave a partner to do their shopping and meet up again later. The food court is also impressive with a wide range of outlets selling reasonably priced fare."

Had time to scout the area and take a few photos with the stunningly lit tree. It is impossible to miss and very strategically placed. We went on Tue, Dec 19, so probably a little less crowded than weekends. There are many possible spots to either take a photo or video--water fountain, moving escalator, staircase, levels 1-4, you name it.  Just be prepared to work around the shopping crowd at some point. There is also a giant pre-lit reindeer on level 3 which looks better when photographed at a distance.",
        "Countdown is displayed on monitors near the Christmas tree and the show started on time. If taking a video, press start around the 0:05 mark so your video begins with the red tree. It was a short (3-1/2 minutes!) but stunning Christmas display--the holiday music, the changing images plus the fake snow at the end--very entertaining and sure to put everyone in a festive mood. Well worth a visit to Toronto Eaton Centre this Christmas season. The tree light and snow show is on until Sun, Dec 31. "

Now I'm here and looking for Roots to pick up a few hoodies for my Fiance's nephew. ",

My mission was to go to Roots and visible signage placed on the scaffolding. It drove me around to see what the facelift was about. On that stroll, out of simple curiosity, I see how many businesses are here thriving and still humming. Workers/store employees don't look depressed, customers who belong here appear to be here and the occasional rif raf but that is expected in this part of Toronto. ",

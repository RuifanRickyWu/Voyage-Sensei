A Beautiful Noise was spectacular and the key performers were outstanding and the Rock & Roll Hall of fame was full of numerous things to see of great interest however the time allotment of 3 hours was only a fraction of the time needed. We spent 1.5 hrs on the lower floor and had to rush through the rest.",

        "This was my very first time booking with ShortTrips. It was my birthday and I wanted to treat myself to a nice day out. ",
        "The bus was on time but there were crumbs all over the seat that I was assigned, as though the bus had not been cleaned prior to departure. Not a great first impression. There were no seat trays and we were provided with one bottle of water only. We were told that if we wanted more, we could fill it up ourselves at a top. There were no snacks. ",
        "A safety DVD was played in the audiovisual equipment. Nothing more was offered on the 6-hour drive. A movie would have been nice. The equipment was there! Instead, the guide barked out all of the \"can't do\" rules, gave a short description of the castle and then nothing. There was no promotion of future trips, no anecdotes of past trips or anything else that might be slightly entertaining. Just rules.",
        "We were told that there would be an hour and 15 minutes lunch stop at the Big Apple. I have severe dietary restrictions so made a sandwich to bring with me. We were told that we could bring the food on the bus to eat as long as it wasn't ice cream. I got off the bus to buy a coffee but when I returned the bus was locked and there was no sign of anyone to unlock it. I waited the hour for someone to unlock the bus and then ate my sandwich while we were on route.",
        "We arrived at Rockport late, boarded the boat and made our way to the castle. The boat crew were very friendly and entertaining. They were actually quite good! They offered information about the various islands and interesting stories about particular cottages and homes.",
        "Upon arriving at Heart Island, we passed through customs and then were told when to meet back at the boat. We were not provided with an audio guide, a map of the island, or any other points of interest. Just simply told to go off on our own and meet back at the boat by 4:45 p.m. Needless to say, I did not get the full benefit of the experience. I had so many questions with no one there to answer. I would not call this a tour. ",
        "In hindsight, I think it would have been better to drive myself to Rockport and park. Parking is free for those taking the Rockport ferry to the island. Admission to Boldt Castle is only $16. I would then rent a headset so I would know what I was looking at and not miss some of the features which I did not know I was missing until after I was back on the bus.",
        "The Rockport Thousand Island tour was great. The island itself was beautiful and there is a brochure inside the castle that you can pick up which gives you an idea of the layout, but it doesn't really give you much information about things that matter and the the signage is not the best. ",
        "I was very disappointed with this tour company. I don't think I will be booking with them again. They did not live up to my expectations. Perhaps it was just an off day for them, but I was not impressed."

This plaza has Burlington's and DSW Designer Shoe Warehouse. This is an optional side trip for those who are interested and we will be at this plaza for 1 hour from 1:45 to 2:45 PM and then we will bring you back to Boulevard Consumer Square for Target, Marshall's etc. Please note that if you do this side trip, you will only have about 1hr 15min of shopping time left at the Target plaza.",

        "Charmaine, our tour guide was exceptional as she was very well organized and experienced. We arrived at the border at 10:00 am. The female bus driver went inside the border office first. Charmaine then informed us that the bus driver was not allowed to enter the US. Charmaine assured us that the trip would continue with taxicabs for all of us to go to the first stop, Walmart. This would all be paid by the company. We had to walk a great distance to an area away from the Customs building. Furthermore, she informed us that they were working on getting a bus to pick us up at Walmart to go to the next stop. That never happened. Instead Charmaine ordered more taxicabs for us to go to the outlets which was not on the itinerary. We had to carry our heavy bags with us as we walked through the outlet mall which did not allow us ample time to shop (1 hour) and made it difficult to shop. Following this location, we were informed that a bus driver was found in Canada to pick us up to take us to our last stop, Wegmans. He arrived at 4:45 pm but by the time we loaded our bags onto the bus, we arrived at Wegmans at 5:30 pm. We had one hour to shop, eat dinner and fill out our customs declarations, hardly enough time for all of that. We had to catch the bus @6:30 pm to drive to the border. All of us were whisked through customs without having to pay duty for our purchases. We made it back to the Mississauga stop at 8:30 pm (the scheduled time). Charmaine informed us that we would be getting a complete refund of $119 for the bungled trip. This was my first and last time traveling with this company. A simple criminal record check should always be a requirement for any Canadian traveling to the US as a bus driver. I’m a senior with severe arthritis in my knees and back. These changes to the trip involved much more walking. The majority of the people had issues with walking. In addition, we didn’t have time to go to Trader Joe’s which was the main reason I booked this trip. Most of us wanted to go to that store as they have many dairy free and gluten free products for people with dietary restrictions. Overall, I enjoyed the bus ride and met wonderful ladies. I would not recommend this company to anyone looking at bus travel in the future. It was catastrophic!"

The ICE HOTEL was spectacular and I will definitely do this tour again next year. The tour guides at the Chateau Frontenac were funny, knowledgeable and full of information. It was special to see a descendent of one of Louis 14th Filles du Roi and hear her talk about the history of New France (which was a huge territory at that time that went into Northern part of the USA, to what Quebec City is today).  The brunch at the Sugar Shack was very hearty and wonderful, in Quebec cuisine style and involving one of Quebec's highest export - Maple Syrup.  The Tour Director - Bonnie was very friendly, funny, approachable and more than willing to answer any questions you had. It was a fun, interesting, and enjoyable trip. I am a woman travelling alone with this group and felt very safe :) at all times."

Then.. a meal of trout, finished off by a tasty dessert and coffee. All this with nice company(from the Shorttrips.ca bus tour) at the Table Rock Restaurant.

        "The performance was simply spectacular. I was drawn to the stage, captivated from start to finish!!! Incredibly talented young artists. The music and special effects brought me back to how thoroughly I enjoyed Michael Jackson's original song and video hits of the 70's (Jackson Five), and 80's. All and all, a truky memorable and moving experience!! Loved it!!!",
        "My second visit to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame with Short Trips, was so much fun, and this also brought me back in time to the music icons that I have followed and so enjoyed over the years!!!",
        "I loved the wonderful people I met and conversed with on this two day trip!!",
        "The unexpected venue switch due to a power failure caused by a storm the day before, was so smoothly handled by Chris, the Tour Director, and of course, the amazing Sash, who made it all possible, without any notable disruption and inconvenience to us passengers!!! The downtown location, next to the theater and close to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame was perfect!!!",
        "I enjoyed the Wegman lunch stop, and Walmart Shopping Break.  ",
        "I must mention, however that the time for lunch/dinner breaks need to be extended to allow for added line up wait times and bathroom use, as these were quite rushed...",
        "Overall,  yet another exciting  getaway with Short Trips which did not disappoint!!!",
        "Thank you, Chris, Justin, and Sash for all your hard efforts to organizing and seeing that this tour was a success!!!!"

        "Great event to see The Six Nations of the Grand River Powwow.  It was a very hot sunny day. A lot of Indigenous vendors selling a lot of items - bags, beautiful skirts, blouses, beaded necklaces, bracelets and anklets all hand made.  So many gorgeous costumes the Indigenous people wore, the MC was wonderful. The trip on the bus was comfortable, we made sufficient stops. Only suggestion - re: timing - by the time we reached there close to 11:00am it was extremely crowded, we may have to get on the bus an hour earlier - pick up times to be 8:00am versus 9:00am. Other than that, was a great day. Chris was great, thorough and well organized :)"

Sash (owner) runs a tip top organization, he is a class act in which he goes above & beyond for his clients. The Director, Toni is such a wonderful person, she always made sure everything ran smoothly. The driver, Jimmy, another great guy! Not one complaint….actually one….wish it was longer!!! I booked another trip while I was still on the bus!!"

        "I always wanted to visit Manitoulin Island and Tobermory but did not want to do the long drive. What a great opportunity to find out about Short Trips just through conversation with a stranger about my travels.",
        "Toni our Tour Director did an excellent job  coordinating and making sure everything on the itinerary ran smoothly. Toni was always helpful and would take the extra time to check out what restaurants were available in the area we were visiting when meals were not included on the trip. What a great idea Toni for holding a sign at the front of the bus indicating the time  when the bus would be leaving the area visited, so everyone can see it before disembarking the bus. On all my travels no other tour company does that extra reminder.",
        "What a fantastic and interesting itinerary that Short Trips put together for Manitoulin Island and Tobermory. It was a wonderful experience and I had so much fun and lots of laughs with everyone that I met on the tour.",
        "Manitoulin Hotel & Conference Centre was a lovely hotel that we stayed at. The rooms were spacious and clean and some were lucky to have a room with a view of the lake. Not me, but I was able to capture a beautiful sunset from my friends room. The lobby of the hotel is beautiful and quite cozy with a fireplace in the middle and a view of the lake where you could capture the sunset if you did not want to go outside in the evening. The location of the Hotel is great. A few short steps to the swinging bridge, the only entrance to the Island by land. The hotel is very near the harbourfront marina, maybe a 5 minute walk. There is a few restaurants in walking distance, but some close early for dinner. I went to Elliott's Restaurant which closes at 9pm in summer and is a 7 minute walk from the hotel. There is also Tim Hortons a short walk further from Elliott's that is open at 5am and closes at 11am.",
        "What a lovely first day of an all day guided tour of Manitoulin Island with our tour guide Christine. I loved the interesting stories Christine shared with us of the life of the residents of Manitoulin Island. One of our stops was at the Kagawong Bridal Veil Falls. Very scenic and a nice photo spot. Check out the small  St. John The Evangelist Anglican Church with the pulpit in a shape of a boat. Had a lovely picnic boxed lunch at Providence Bay. So many lovely stops which Toni usually allotted one hour free time. The two hour Wikwemikong Unceded Territory tour with a local guide was very interesting and I would suggest if you have never been it is something you should not miss even though there is an option on Short Trips itinerary to skip this tour if you want to go back to the hotel.",
        "The next part of our journey was to take the Chi Cheemaun ferry  to Tobermory. Don't miss the picture perfect spot to take a photo of the Chi Cheeman arriving to the ferry dock. What a beautiful sight! It is very colorful with native art painted on the outside of the boat. There are a few shops at the port which I was very happy, as I wanted a souvenir of Manitoulin Island to remember the special memories I had. I was all in mauve attire that day and I found myself a mauve baseball cap with Manitoulin Island printed on it. Another nice spot on the tour was Sauble Falls Provincial Park. Very picturesque. Tobermory is a very small town with lots of souvenir shops and choice of restaurants or you can just walk around and check out the sail boats at the dock. Our next  part of our tour was to Flowerpot Island which did not happen and had to be cancelled because of the very bad weather passing through all of Ontario. I am very impressed how Toni and Short Trips has graciously handled this situation.",
        "I would highly recommend Short Trips if you are looking for interesting places to visit for a day or a short trip. It is really nice to receive an e-mail a few days before the trip with a timeline of the itinerary. I am certainly looking forward to booking more trips with Short Trips for places I always wanted to go but to far to drive or going to places I never even heard of with such an interesting itinerary just for an outing for the day."

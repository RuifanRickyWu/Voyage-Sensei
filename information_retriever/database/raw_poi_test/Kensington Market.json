  "description": "Immerse yourself in the heart of Toronto’s bohemian culture at Kensington Market. Restaurants and hole-in-the-wall eateries offering food from all over the world are interspersed with vintage thrift shops, coffee joints, tattoo parlors, bars, art galleries, and Victorian-style houses. The area is part gritty, part chaotic but it has tons of personality. The best time to visit is on Pedestrian Sundays (last Sunday of the month from May to October), when street parties and festivals are the highlights. Take public transportation to get there as parking is hard to come by. You can experience the neighborhood on a food, walking, or bike tour. – Tripadvisor",

Proximity to homeless shelter and Chinatown skid row creates a  self-perpetuating supply of roving mental patients that adds to the overall low-key threatening ambiance. An overnight in Toronto’s drunk tank lockup is a good bet for a similar experience."

        "The spa is very beautiful.  I see that some reviews say it is run down, but it must have been renovated because it is very very nice.  Staff gave great service (facial and massage).  Everything is comfortable and professional in terms of the spa service.  Like very comfortable.  Nice beds, cozy sheets, comfy robes.  Much better than other spas I have been to downtown.  Staff are friendly.  Overall very relaxing.",
        "I can suggest one area for improvement- at the end of the service I was presented with a bill that included a set 18% gratuity.  To me, this is a FEE not a tip.  The amount was actually very similar to what I had intended to tip (only a few dollars different) but it is the fact that this makes things awkward when the bill is all printed off and just waiting for you to pay it.  Makes it seem very mandatory, as I said, like a fee.  When I questioned it, I was told it was optional and they can print me a new one if I like... awkward! I wanted to split the tip in a certain way between the 2 staff however I was very uncomfortable with the way my tip/fee was presented to me, I just paid it and left.  I gather that they do this to ensure workers are paid well.  I am all for worker rights, but just pay them a few more bucks and allow customers to tip as they like. This kind of soured things for me at the end of an otherwise great experience."

        "Trump Toronto hotel is fantastic, they take customer service and guest expectations to the next level.  So you can imagine how disappointed I was when the spa fell short.  Inexperienced people working there.  They gave no direction on where to go, had no clue what services we had booked, after our first treatment we were told to wait and in one area for our second treatment but were forgotten about.  They booked out services incorrectly.  I had to take the lead with every aspect of my time there, very unorganized.   the whole spa experience was lacking.  The treatments and the people doing them were good though. But for the price and the fact that this spa is in such a great hotel, I would expect a way better spa experience.     With all the great spas close by to this hotel, I would not return to this one."

        "An associate and myself wanted to relax after a long day of  meetings. But dear god - who chose the management there please?! The staff were friendly and accommodating, the massage I received was decent as well, however when we were relaxing in the lounge room, all of a sudden, we heard screams coming from the lobby! At first I assumed it was a disgruntled guest, but eventually it turns out it was the manager of the spa screaming at some of the employees. After the treatment, the manager greeted us with a friendly yet phoney demeanor (as she was clearly not aware of our presence within ear-shot). I feel pity for the staff, as you can tell by the atmosphere and their faces that something is definitely wrong. The manager surely needs some oversight. I believe I will  not come back simply because of this. It's sad."

The changerooms were nicely arranged and although we didn't use them, it was nice to see we could have showered right there after our massage, with all the amenities provided if we wanted to.  We had two regrets. Not booking Manny/peddies to go with our service and not having brought swimsuits to enjoy a post massage swim as recommended by our RMT's. But I guess you can't have everything and we will remember for next time!"

        "Don't waste your money at this spa.  My girlfriend and I attended this spa as a treat after the recent holiday season.  Upon arrival no one was at the front desk. We waited for 10 minutes for one of the massage therapists to usher us into the locker room where we had trouble finding two bathrobes and any slippers. Some of the lockers wouldn't even close properly.  Once in the massage room, I noticed the pillow cover was very dirty and asked for it to be changed.  The therapist told me he had forgotten to put the correct new cover on it - yuck!  The lights were not working at all in the room so I was subject to a desk lamp in the corner which was directly in my eyes the whole time. When I asked about the lights the therapist said they are having technical problems and they haven't been working for days. He then left the room to look for a towel to cover my eyes, and came back with a thin sheet. By then any relaxation I could have experienced was ruined.  The therapist felt bad and added an additional 2 minutes to my massage.  Thanks but no thanks.  Never again."

        "When your paying 200$ for a massage, you have high expectations. The locker rooms were messy and I had to search for a robe. The waiting room/lounge had dirty mugs and plates everywhere laying around. The masseuses were 20 minutes late to bring us into our rooms. The massage itself was one of the worst I've experienced and I felt so bored throughout. You can hear people laughing and talking in the hallway as your trying to relax. When accepting an offer for a tea, the lady never came back with one. No organization, no relaxation, no warmth from any of the staff. The only good thing was the massage therapist taught me a stretch technique for tight traps. Save your wasted time and go to any other luxury spa in the city."

You can't really get a receipt itemized until you give payment type. While the services were good. Massage was awesome. The experience as a whole was a mess. Manager made loads of excuses. "

      "text": [
        "As with the high end hotel spas there is somewhat of an expected premium on service so the $165.00 -60 minute massage was not surprising. What was surprising was the complete lack of peripheral services you expect when paying this premium. There was a lobby - a small side room where I completed my paperwork , change room/showers and treatment rooms.  Even in the change room the paper towels were akin to something you would find in a Walmart bathroom, low end hair products and no-name brand mouthwash.  No cell service in the change room and no drinking water to be seen anywhere. The topper in this whole disappointing venture was the room was so hot I could barely stand it. And the therapist agreed whole heartedly but could not change it.  To put it in perspective I usually ask for the heated pad in areas not being worked on. I was actually sweating and it was so dry I had to ask the therapist for a drink half way through when I started coughing. The treatment was so so. Even though it was Swedish the pressure was so light it was negligible. Disappointing right to the end where I had to struggle with my bags through the door leaving the tower while the doorman looked on. ",

The afternoon started with some time in the pool, jacuzzi, and sauna, then I met with Stella for an hour massage. She was very attentive, asking if the pressure was ok, and what my areas of concern were. Once we were wrapped up, I had my own VIP room with a wonderful lunch and a buffet of sweets waiting for me. Next it was off with Klara for a 75 min body wrap. She was simply amazing! A very warm smile, very comforting, and calmly led me through the entire treatment, step by step (it was my first time). Overall, it was a very relaxing afternoon with Stella and Klara... just what I needed!"

I didn't have a lot of time to spend, about an hour and a bit, so I opted for an express manicure, facial waxing, and mineral makeup application at Purebeauty at the Trump. I was blown away by their 5-star service from start to finish. My waxing was the best I've ever had, no bumps or redness, and my makeup looked phenomenal and was done in record time. My favourite part was getting served sparkling juice and truffles while getting a manicure. It's the attention to small details that make this place stand out.

        "Other guests had manicures and pedicures and were very impressed with how thorough the services were. ",
        "Overall, I would highly recommend this spa and salon and can’t wait to return!!!"

        "Booked a couples massage during our stay at the Trump Hotel for our anniversary. Cassandra, the Spa Concierge was very helpful, telling me what packages to choose and providing me with details on the spa.",
        "Checking in at the spa was quick and easy. The change rooms were nice, big and spacious. Once we got settled (completed some paper work), we went for our couples massage, it was a good massage, the RMT definitely knew what she was doing and what muscle groups to work on. IT was one of those massages where I was like 60 minutes was definitely not enough.",
        "After the massage we were taken to a nice room, offered tea and other drinks, and there was some light snacks. It was relaxing to sit in comfy chairs and not have anything to do or anywhere to go.",
        "The spa also has a sauna which we didnt use and a pool."

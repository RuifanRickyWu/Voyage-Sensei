        "Booked in for a birthday party package for my twelve year old son and his friends.  Cost was absolutely ski high - more than $600 for 45 mins of laser tag and some pizza and drinks. But the  sales lady told me they would take care of everything - would even have a party host to help co-ordinate. I told her this was especially important because I use a wheelchair so I wanted someone to really help with the boys - hence why I wasn't hosting it at home.  What a farce that was! The nightmare began when I called the place on the way there to let them know we were running late - could the host be there ready to let the boys into the laser tag straightaway? Manager told me on the phone \"Yes - we will do our best for you - host will be ready.\" The laser tag is booked back to back so whatever time you miss - it's gone forever. My husband ran in with all the boys - no one was there - no one was ready - wasted precious more minutes to go and look for the host and sign in. Then she didn't even tell the boys how to use the lasers or how the vests worked! The boys said the vests weren't even working properly for one team. When I told the manager he said they check them all the time. How can that be when the games are back to back with kids using them?? Once they got into the party room, I thought the host would help us to serve out food and such. I had asked her how the pizza would come and what drinks they had - she didn't even know. She said she hadn't worked for a while so she wasn't sure!! Has anyone heard of staff training?!?  I asked why all the party stuff was all mismatched - I had been told would have matching cups, plates, napkins cutlery. Instead looked like the left overs from an office coffee room. She didn't have any answer to that either!  When the food came, she helped to serve out the first slices of pizza - after that she stood in the corner as the boys helped themselves - spilling the juice and eating the pizza in two seconds. It was so thin it was gone very quickly and the boys were still starving! I asked is this all there is? I thought the package would take care of everything? Was told I would have to go out of the party room and all the way to main sign in desk to order another pizza and it would be another 15 mins to get it!  The host helped with nothing after that - no offer to take group photo, no help to hand out cupcakes - no photo of me and my son! It was horrible.  Absolute rip off for more than $600!  I told the manager and told him I was really unhappy with the service and he just stood there and repeated the package details to me. It was infuriating."

Ball return machine jams (this happened to us and to the lane beside us too). Entire alley stalls and when a staff person is called, very little time is credited back. Not so great when you pay by the hour to bowl!",

So today, I decided to go to the facility and try to talk to someone. I asked to talk to the manager Ryan Evoy and he refused to talk to leave his desk and come to assist us. They forced us to book lanes on line and that's not what I was looking for. Very nice facility with poor customer service."

        "Had my son's bday party there.  The staff were helpful and it was not busy.  Really have to say that Srijah worked hard to make sure that we were taken care of.  She was our host for the kids party, and she was not the type of person to sit around and just 'phone it in'.  She made sure everything was done for us.  We did bowling and laser tag.  Maria was good too, and she walked around inside to make sure that everyone was safe and enjoying it.  We came back a week later just to use the arcade, and the girl Samantha at the counter was so helpful with making sure the kids could play the games, and receive all the points they could.  She was patient with their gift selection too.  Definitely plan to come back more often with this kind of service and all the activities available"

        "This is a really nice facility. They recently underwent renovations and it looks really great inside. I did not see what it looked like before, but it definitely looks great now. ",
        "When you walk in, to your right is an arcade area (I didn't really pay much attention to it, though, as I was there for bowling) and then just past that is the bar area. Very clean, well-organized and well-stocked. I always appreciate when a bar has a decent selection of draft beer, instead of just the standard Budweiser and Canadian. Not to say it's a big list, but at least they have Rickards Red! ",
        "The food menu is also quite decent, with some platter options for large groups, such as ours. I didn't get a chance to take pictures of the food, because everyone pretty much dove in the moment it arrived at our table. I'd say the combo platters are a good value (around $30) and you get a mountain of fries with it. We also tried the poutine, which did NOT look like the photo on the menu, BTW. Great fries, but very weak otherwise. Thin, terrible gravy and very minimal cheese curds. Big portion, though, so it was good for sharing. ",
        "The bowling area is awesome. Love the set up, with comfy seats and ample room for six people per lane. The lanes are very well maintained and again, so clean! The balls are in good condition and there seemed to be enough of each size for everyone, but I did hear comments that some of the lighter ones (6-7lbs) had very small finger holes so they were not as easy to bowl with. ",
        "We just bowled on the regular lanes, as described above, but there's also a VIP section at the very back that has cosmic (glow-in-the-dark) bowling. This would be fun on a Friday or Saturday night, but for our group, the regular lanes were just fine. ",
        "The only reason I'm not scoring them 5 stars, was due to price when reserving lanes, and the terrible new website. It's really poorly done - I reserved lanes online and it took a while to find all the info I was looking for (pricing, shoe rental, specials, etc.) Hint: the 'menu' is at the top left of the main screen (why hide it?). The old site was much easier to navigate. ",
        "I feel if you're booking ahead and paying a deposit for your reservation, you should be able to take advantage of the special pricing. Well, I won't be doing that again. Next time, we'll just walk in and take our chances that lanes are available. Besides, it wasn't even busy on the day we went (Wednesday) until around 7:30pm or so. But we will still go back."

From the first telephone enquiry, to online booking for our lanes and return confirmation, all meant we could plan our family outing for maximum fun from the moment we arrived.",

        "We were a pretty rusty bunch to begin with, with lots of heavy landings, a couple of ruined manicures,  and we did keep the gutters pretty busy.  However, everyone improved (even a 'turkey' or two), as the frames went on, due to the fact that it's been about 20 years since most of us had been bowling.  However, this terrific day was a great success, and has made us all eager to do this more often, and we would certainly make Playtime our first choice for the next date."

But, when the food came there were no plates or napkins. When we asked for them staff said, \"I'm just a bus boy and I don't know when I'll be able to come back to get you your stuff.\" We had to go to the family washroom to get paper towels. ",

        "I went to Playtime Bowl for the first time with my family on March Break.  It's really cool when you walk in for the first time and see all the flashing lights and the music videos playing on the big screens over the bowling lanes.  There is one side of the building that is colourful and loud and good for families (the side that we were bowling on), the other side is the opposite of that and good for bowling clubs and adults.  My family ordered some fries and chicken nuggets from the bar, and they were just OK.  They were what you'd expect from a bowling alley.  Overall, it was lots of fun and I recommend it to people of all ages.  Playtime Bowl isn't a huge attraction where tourists and people flock to every year, it's just a place where you can take your family and friends and have fun."

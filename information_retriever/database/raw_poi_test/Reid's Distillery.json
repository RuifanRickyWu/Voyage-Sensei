I muddled five blackberries, a small quantity of chocolate mint leaves, a scant tablespoon of honey, then added a generous squeeze of lemon juice, 3 ounces of this spectacular gin, three ice cubes, and a generous layer of sparkling water. Drinking it neat is an unmatchable experience in terms of gin. The cocktail, without further explanation, is simply delicious. Everyone is entitled to an opinion; those who pan it have something wrong with their taste buds. This is a gin in a class by itself… Superior to all others ."

The Reid family have built a beautiful facility and they make darn good gin in 3 main styles: original, citrus and spiced. The tasting starts with a taste of their original gin at room temperature; then one adds ice; then tonic water. The first allows one to discern the true spirit of the gin; with ice, you have a very dry martini! The added tonic showcases a really good GnT. Our tasting was led by Graham Reid, who enthusiastically and ably led us through the history of gin, and the way the Reids fashion theirs. Next, Graham took us to the actual stills and described the process of turning water into gin: a miracle! Finally, we each chose a cocktail to close the tasting from a list of four. All brilliant. While we sipped, people came in to shop for gins, tonics and other cocktail necessities. Graham wore a mask and we were required to mask when walking about. At the tasting bar, we kept our distance from those outside our bubble but removed our masks to taste. This is a highly recommended “thing to do” during these perilous times. Cheers!"

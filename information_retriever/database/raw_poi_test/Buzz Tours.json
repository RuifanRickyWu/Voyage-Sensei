  "description": "When in Toronto, take some time to experience all that this great city has to offer. Let the great guides at Buzz Tours show you show you around the city, on one of our many 2-3 hour guided tours. Our walking tours are limited to a maximum of 8 guests per tour, so that we engage in conversation with our guests rather than have them following a flag and 100 other people through the city streets. We will show you the sights and tell you the many stories that make Toronto one of the world's great cities. Our guests generally comment that a Buzz Tour is like a city walk with a friend. If group tours are not your thing, that's not a problem. Try one of our Private Walking Tours. Select a tour that we offer and make it your own (and include 7 of your guests if you'd like). Whatever tour or type of tour you choose, we are certain, you will enjoy your time seeing the city.",

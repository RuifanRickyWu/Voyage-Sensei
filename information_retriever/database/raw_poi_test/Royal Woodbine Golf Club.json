  "description": "Etobicoke is a relaxed area along the Humber River. It's saturated with green spaces and conservatories, making it a premier destination for outdoor sports, hiking, and nature walks. Its abundance of parkland and lakes makes it a typical spot for fishing, picnicking, and camping out, especially in warmer months. The peaceful area is also enjoyed by families, who appreciate its boardwalks and sports facilities. Locals enjoy the variety of golfing and country club opportunities, which also provide lessons for golfers of any skill level.",

(Have noticed this on all 3 of my visits).",

        "I wanted to like this place so much, but the behavior of the Marshals were terrible.  Long story short, we booked a tee time for two (with cart) for an early morning tee time.  Upon arrival, we were paired with walkers. These were the only walkers for the morning and were placed in front of several small groups with carts.  We made the best of it and waited for the walkers on the first nine.  ",
        "About the 7th hole, the marshal told us (specifically is players in the cart) to pick up rate of play.  We explained that we were paired with walkers and they were causing the “delay”.  The marshal never approached the walkers. All groups behind us had carts and were 2-3 players. The marshals then followed us to the 8th-10th holes and watched us play. On the 10th hole the marshals approached us in the cart again and told us to play from the red tees due to rate of play.  They also made a comment about it being a “rough” game.  We completed the front 9 in 2 hours and 11 minutes, even while waiting for walkers, slightly above average for rate of play.  We left after the 10th due to the continued harassment by both marshals.",
        "I would not return again due to this behavior, but I will say that the clubhouse staff were apologetic and receptive to our concerns, especially Roy."

There had been drainage work performed last year and the resurfacing was poorly done. The cart paths remind me of some Toronto roads... very bumpy and under repair. The tee blocks are worn and neglected. The course is in desperate need of upkeep. The best thing about the course is the location which is close to the airport."

Plus the bonus of some give and go between me and my  guest while striking a deal. Ladies had a great time. Staff were amazing and lunch afterwards was a treat. Thanks and we'll see you again."

Crazy expensive for this type of course. 2pm-3pm fee was $91.50 plus cart fee of $7.50  If you park in the further part of the parking lot they are selective as to who can drive their cart through the parking lot to their car to unload their clubs. So that was a bit different and unexpected.  Not on my future playlist for sure."

        "FIRST time playing the course during the week,there was a tournament.First issue,Royal Woodbine does NOT let you pick up your clubs from your car,or drop them off at YOUR car using their cart.If driving a cart to your car is what you want to do,and can do at other courses,Royal Woodbine will not be accessible,nor convenient.This isn't a course that has valet service,and I don't expect it with such a course.Cart rule was provided to my golf partner,and I by a staff member quoting management.This policy should give pause to those thinking of having a tournament at this location.Having over 100 players driving their cars to the already narrow club drop off area,then driving carts to the same tight area behind the cones to pickup their clubs is inconvenient.Fast forward, post our 18,the same cones BLOCKING carts from entering the parking lot were REMOVED.Players used carts to drop off their clubs to their cars in the parking lot. Second issue,there were holes with obvious sitting water due to the the recent rain in the past week we played.Yet, I was not expecting to step into a shin level, DEEP mud puddle near their irrigation while heading to the fairway.One would hope their course staff would place a flag to warn players.Course GM was notified,nothing was done to rectify the experience. Two stars are given for the FANTASTIC pictures you can get from playing below the Pearson International airport flight path."

Unfortunately the service at the Club House needs improvement. The \"back shop\" is generally understaffed. The restaurant is not open for breakfast. One gets the impression the course is ran on a \"shoestring\" and relies on it's excellent location in Toronto's west end. The green fees could be considered reasonable if the Club improved it's service and made what could be a truly great golfing experience."

Most fairways are tight with many creeks and ponds. Greens are quick. Not a a lot of holes that the big slice or draw hitter off the tee will like. Some nice challenging \"dog legs\" and par 3's. The big driver is always tempted to cut a corner or fly some water or rough. Think twice about it ?  Staff are friendly, pro shop prices good and food was good also. There are lots of Hotel choices in the area close to the course. Prices for a round with a cart are ok. I generally only have the opportunity to play this couse once a year and look forward to it."

The course was decently maintained however, they enforced a cart path only policy - in which case, it would have been easier to walk the course given the course cart path layout. On every hole, expect a plane to fly overhead every 2-3 minutes if you don't mind the distraction also consider that it makes it difficult to talk to your party as well.",

The course was not busy, which helped the speed of play, but it was telling that others likely think the same thing. My recommendation is to drive 30 extra minutes to play at a REAL golf course that doesn't have planes landing <2km away."

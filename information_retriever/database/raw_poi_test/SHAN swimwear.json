  "description": "Midtown is a dynamic part of Toronto with some of its most stylish high-rise residences and heritage buildings. The area sees busy shoppers with bag-laden arms balancing lattes in paper cups as they travel from one luxury brand to the next, taking advantage of the proximity of high-end shops. The reflecting pools, jogging trails, and nature treks of the Rosehill Revision are always a hub of outdoor activity, and after a workout from either running or splurging, many take advantage of the spas and massage parlors Midtown has to offer. Away from the bakeries, boutiques, and glamorous old theaters of the district's center, locals use the weekend to embrace the more suburban feel of Midtown's parks, tennis courts, outdoor markets, and the manicured grounds of Casa Loma, while families indulge the area's state-of-the-art playground and learning facilities. Of course, no high-brow district is complete without a healthy counter-culture: Midtown boasts some of the wildest street art and full-wall graffiti of any neighborhood in Toronto.",

        "Unfortunately, I came to this store to buy a one piece and 2 piece bathing suit for my vacation the following day. I had loved the one piece bathing suit (as the only one that has ever fit properly) however was surprised when I opened the package on my vacation to find that I was only sold one of the two that I thought I purchased. My suggestion to anyone who shops here in the future is to check your bag to ensure ALL pieces are included. $400 is a lot of money to be walking away disappointed with one bathing suit. The best customer service I received was to put the one piece bathing suit on hold upon my return of the vacation that I purchesded it for..... I could have gone elsewhere for my money’s worth and received both suites with better customer service.  Severely disappointed in a shop that has great potential to outsell other bathing suit shops in Toronto. I would not shop here based on the above alone. This may fly in New York City, however their customer service would far exceed the response I got. My advice to you would be to go get a custom suit for the price I paid for one and you won’t leave disappointed."

        "I will start by saying I have been buying Shan suits the past 3 to 4 years.  There has never been oil come from a clasp or discoloration of any of the metal detailing.  I use these suits when I go south a few times a year, but other than that they primarily are stored in a container in my closet.  I know some will cringe, but I have even put them in the washing machine on occassion.  They are excellent garments and fit like no other bikini I have every worn.  The service at the store in Toronto is impeccable and because of this I don't bother going anywhere else.  They know my size, colour preferences and best fits so I can be in and out very quickly."

        "I came across SHAN about 5 years ago. The fit is amazing, I have a fuller bust size and I love how well made SHAN is. I have worn my swimwear on many beaches and in oceans and pools and have not be disappointed! You can order online and can actually speak with someone if you need help with ordering. I have no complaints with this line and will order again!!",

        "I owned a cool pair of SHAN swimming shorts for about 3 years. I loved them but unfortunately the elastic in the waist lost it's stretch sooner then I expected. I haven't worn the shorts more than 10 times and I wash by hand. But you know...A 3 year old suit is ok to say good bye to. I've been trying unsuccessfully to purchase another suit on their site for days now. The check out through Paypal is very strange and confusing. I don't receive any feedback as to why the payment isn't going through. I reached out to SHAN in an email and they responded with some suggestions. I did everything they suggested and although I am getting further into the check out flow the final order STILL can't be completed. It's a really weird experience. I do like their products and hope they can figure out how to make check out a smoother experience."

        "I recently purchased my first Shan bikini top (emotion) in Regina SK at the lingerie shoppe. It is impeccably sewn (says my mother who is a seamstress).   I have a rather odd body type. I have a 26 inch waist with a 32F chest (natural). It is quite difficult to find bikini's that actually fit. Well, I finally found one that did!!! My mom just had to take in the back strap which was very easy for her to do.  I am just about to buy another one in another colour.",
        "Also...for the record to the other crazy poster. Are you seriously complaining about a bathing suit FOUR YEARS after buying it? I don't expect anything to last FOUR YEARS!...wow!"

        "Full disclosure: my suit is 4 years old, and was worn less than one dozen times.  After each wear I rinsed the suit thoroughly.  I rarely return clothes.  Imagine my surprise when I donned my suit a few months ago only to find myself covered in oil stains.  Upon removal of the suit, I noticed that the oil came from the hardware (clasps) found on the top of the suit.  The surrounding fabric was caked in oil, and the clasps themselves were faded due to deterioration of the metal.  The white bedding I was lying on prior to taking a swim, was naturally ruined.  The staff at Shan (Avenue Road, Toronto) tsk tsked, and it was up to me to suggest that at the very least they should attempt to have the suite professionally cleaned.  The suit was sent to Montreal for examination, and then returned with a ‘sorry we can’t do anything’ response.  I took the time to write a letter to Shan’s president, Ms. Chantal Levesque, but good luck getting a response from her directly if you don’t speak French – Ms. Leveque only speaks French and I received a call from a customer service rep.  Apparently (as I suggested – note that all the suggestions to address this issue came from me), the clasps couldn’t be replaced as the suit was discontinued.  Fascinating that nowhere on this planet can similar clasps be found.  The rep did say that she wanted me to have a positive experience with Shan, however her ‘positive experience’ suggestion was for me to return to the store and buy another suit at full price.  I’ll presume that the irony of this suggestion will not be lost on anyone reading this review.  As I continued to insist that this suggestion was not satisfactory (“How can you say that this would be a positive experience when you are choosing to do nothing about this issue?”  - question met with silence), the rep said that ‘it would not be fair to our other customers if we gave you a discount or replaced your suit at no additional cost’.  More irony… You should know that I was asking to have the suit replaced with another suit of equal or lesser value, or at a minimum a 50% discount towards the purchase of another suit (yes, despite all this I was willing to return to the store and spend more money on another suit).",
        "The last suggestion the rep made was to offer me an invitation normally sent to their ‘best clients’ for a 40-50% discount towards last year’s swimwear.  And if I didn’t like last year’s swimwear?  Again, no further suggestions made and a reiteration that ‘it wouldn’t be fair to our other customers’ if a discount or replacement of the ruined suit was offered.  I confess that I started to think that perhaps I was asking too much, but to everyone I spoke with regarding this terrible lack of service, I was met with incredulity at:",
        "a) the high price of the suit and b) the fact that Shan chose to do very little to address my concerns.  What a wonderful opportunity they had to address the concerns of a customer who would have shopped there again and again had my concerns been properly addressed.  Instead, I will obviously never shop there again and will strongly encourage anyone I know to also take their business elsewhere."

        "I bought a jersey on their website. After wearing it 5-6 times, one of the side seams faded and small holes appeared.  After contacting customer service, I was told that they had never seen this kind of problem so they can do nothing but offer me 15% on a new purchase!! Ironic enough to think that I will buy a $400 jersey again when the first one did not last 2 months! Despite several reminders, no service.  Extremely disappointing for a Quebec company and, moreover, for the supposed quality and reputation they give themselves.  Never again Shan!"

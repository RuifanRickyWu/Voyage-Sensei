The staff are helpful, service fantastic and the stretch of the Humber is just long enough for novices and experienced paddlers alike. But what makes TO Adventures different you ask? First, reasonable prices, secondly \"extras\" like music, comedy and night paddling events for starters. Rosaire and co. go the extra mile to ensure a safe, enjoyable experience! Finally, throw in an abundance of birds and wildlife in their own habitat and the experience is complete. Highly recommended!"

        "In January 2018 I went for a dog sledding trip, and a couple days later a snowshoeing trip. ",
        "The dog sledding trip was great fun, and really something different to try out. I found the dogs to be enthusiastic and friendly. Yes if you are expecting them to all be like house dogs curled up on the sofa it would be a bit of a shock, but they are not, and they seemed totally fine. It's a great trip to get to know other travellers as there is a little fire with seats so you can warm up, get some s'mores and chat with others.",
        "However, if you want a real winter experience I HIGHLY recommend taking a snowshoeing trip. Where the dog sledding itself is over quite quickly, snowshoeing is a good 3-4 hours of walking through the woods, over small frozen rivers, occasionally seeing other people out in the forest, looking out for tracks of different animals and learning how to build a fire (even in a snowy forest!) Definitely one of the highlights of my trip to Toronto, and the guys running the business are very friendly and great to chat to, with one of them even going to the university in the city over from my tiny little uk city so plenty to chat about! I will definitely be suggesting to one of my friends at work who is visiting toronto in summer to check this company out c: Overall, a great time at both events."

      "text": [
        "Upon our arrival to the dog sledding adventures, we were told while waiting to go check out the dogs.  To the left was a small area with around 12-15 dogs that we were excited to see and interact with.  Most of them seemed happy enough with the exception of a few that seemed hesitant and even some that refused to come out of their poorly constructed barrel huts.  We sat for 10 minutes with one dog encouraging it to come out, but it was shaking and was not very trusting. As we stood up to go back to our group we noticed a whole other section of dogs through a pathway further along the trail and we decided to go check it out.  We thought there were only 5 more dogs, but as we approached closer and the longer we stayed the more dogs came out from their huts and we quickly realized there were at least 50 more dogs.  The second dog we approached was inside her hut and had a large gash in her right eye that was full of dry blood and she could barely keep it open.  The sight of this dog and other dogs who could barely even walk brought both of us to tears.  Not one dog looked happy to be there. You could actually see the sadness in their eyes.  Each dog wore a heavy collar that was much too tight and chained to an object in the center of their tiny enclosure with many dog's chains bound up where they couldn't even move.  The only place they could go to the washroom was right where they stood.  There was poop and urine all over their circle and under their feet.  After speaking with the owner we learned that the dogs stay here day and night even in the freezing cold weather conditions some of the mixed breeds cleary could not withstand as they were shaking. We noticed that none of the dogs had water, which we realized was because it was so cold it would just freeze, but we worried that these dogs were not being properly fed or hydrated, especially with the fact that they are being forced to pull people on sleds,  We no longer felt comfortable supporting what was happening as we had this ongoing feeling of helplessness and guilt for the conditions these dogs have to live in.  It just doesn't seem right and we hope something is done about it, and that others who visit have the same compassion and thoughts as we did.  No animal should have to live like that."

      "text": [
        "I took my son to kayak on the Humber River and we paid an extra $20 plus tax to get a guided tour each (we had solo kayaks). The lesson consists of a 3 min blur on how to hold your paddle. We were 5 kayaks and one canoe (with mother and two kids). The kayaking is for beginners. I've only ever kayaked twice in the carribean, so I\"m a beginner, but am able to paddle and hold my own of course. So it started off late, we got in the water about 15 min later than expected. So I thought we were going to get a guided tour and a talk about the area etc. and the guide was only helping the canoe people. So we paddled a little fully expecting that this guide would give a briefing and then lead the group. Didn't happen. He sayed with them the whole time. 15 min in I asked the guide it we were going to get a tour, he said yes, but that he had to go at the pace of the slowest person...? I said, well how does that benefit the whole group then? Canoeing from what I hear is very different too, so why merge the two? So I said, that wasn't good enough and that we would go on our own, but that I wanted a refund for the tour part. He said we could work something out when we got back to the registration desk. Kayaking was good. It's about an hour to get to the QEW, and an hour back. They include 2 hours. We got back well within the time. We got to the registration desk and they gave us a cash refund, but of only $20 each. I was out $5. Anyway, good expereince, but don't bother with the lesson and tour. NOTE: they have free parking."

        "We recently booked two tandem kayaks for the Humber River. We are relatively experienced at kayaking, so the fairly sparse pre-trip instructions were fine for us. And we appreciated the cleaning/drying out of one kayak's storage nook before our trip. I can't say as that we saw any staff out on the river during our 2-hour rental. For us, that wasn't a problem, but there were definitely customers who were not experienced and may have needed guidance. But it's a beautiful location (so many migratory birds to see) and such an easy river to navigate in both directions because there is virtually no current. The pricing is a bit high, but I guess for tourists who can't bring their own kayaks, that's the price that the market will bear."

        "I'll start off by mentioning I have paddled the Humber once before in a canoe with one of the Toronto Adventures guides a few yrs back - that was a great experience.  This time there were 6 of us who went out in 3 tandem kayaks - 3 adults, 3 kids (12-15).  During the course of the brief orientation, there was another employee sitting in the canopy behind him talking in a loud voice the entire time making it difficult  to hear him clearly.  At the time I thought \"hmm, bit unprofessional\" but managed to hear what he was saying.",
        " When we set off none of us were made aware that the middle of the river was so shallow for the first leg of the journey.  Only a few minutes out, our kayak  grounded in the middle of the river on a rocky sandbank.  I was forced to get out of the kayak, standing in very cold water above my knees and move us off the river bed.  Unfortunately, when I went to get back in the kayak it capsized and we were wet up to our chests and left with a water-logged vessel.",
        "Incredibly, there was no one from the company standing on the disembarkation point which was only about  50 m away.  We managed to get some of the water out of the boat but it was still 1/2 full. Because the kayak was so full of water,  I waited in the river while my companion paddled back to the bank in the hopes of getting a new, dry kayak.",
        "Eventually she was able to find an employee but instead of providing her w/ a new boat, they told her that someone would come out to help us.  I waited another 10 mins at least before someone showed up and then I had to ask him if he worked for the Toronto Adventures since he never actually came up and said \"do you need some help.\"  WTF - I'm standing alone in the middle of the river up to my crotch in cold water at this point.",
        "The T.A. employee  told me to get back in the water-logged kayak and paddle back to shore where they would get us a new boat.     I'm  not sure why they didn't just do that when my companion went back the 1st time.   ",
        "Needless to say we were both soaked through and my cell phone was toast.  When I mentioned what had happened to the staff, all they could say was \"didn't you hear us tell you not to paddle in the middle of the river when you left, we always tell people that?\"  Well, apparently not every time.   BTW, I asked my fellow kayakers after, if they had heard them warn us  to avoid the middle of the river and ALL  of them said \"no, they never mentioned that.\"   Not even the young man who pushed us off to begin with. ",
        " ",
        "Yes, I was the clumsy one who tipped the kayak getting back in,  but it wouldn't have been necessary for me  to get out of the damn boat in the first place if someone had of told us to avoid that section of the river.   NO ONE told us about the shallow water",
        " We did eventually end up doing our paddle (albeit somewhat shortened and in wet clothes).   For what it's worth,  it was lovely and peaceful  along the river - hence the 3 star rating.",
        "I will say that  despite the presence of at least 4 or 5 Toronto Adventure employees, there didn't seem to be anyone around when my companion went back.  You would think that they might keep a watch out on the bank for people or anyone who might be struggling.   There was someone when we came back in to pull our kayak back up on shore.",
        "  ",
        "I should also point out that I am an experienced kayaker and boater having summered at a family cottage all my life and having operated all sorts of different water craft.  Heck, I even have my own kayak up north.  Our experience was unfortunate but I want to point out that  at no time were we in any danger, just uncomfortable and very let down by the lack of response from the staff.  And of course, out the  replacement cost  of my cell phone.  ",
        "I do worry though that others who aren't as comfortable with water as am I,  would have found this type of experience a bit more harrowing.   Once the employees launch you, there doesn't seem to be anyone around to mind the shop and you're  kind of left on your own."

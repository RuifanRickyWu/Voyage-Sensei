We have been on several private tours, but never had the delightful and engaging conversation we had with Kieran. His intelligence and dry sense of humor made the tour even more fun. The walking portion of the tour is short, but pleasant. You see green space along with interesting architecture. We heard many intriguing historical facts along with very tasting some fantastic treats! Each item we tried was delectable and it was difficult to find a favorite. The St. Lawrence Market is such a cool place to find fabulous food, a multitude of sweets and unique souvenirs. We will definitely visit the market on our next visit to the city."

Our vegetarian friend found an excellent meal to eat.  So this is quite a trendy place with slightly less trendy music. However we enjoyed the ambience.  Service was slick and efficient rather than friendly - but they were busy."

The food was cooked fresh and was tasty, the service was efficient and the guy very pleasant. All in all well worthwhile a visit for lunch or evening meal as there is a back room where live acts appear."

They don‚Äôt deserve your business."

        "We dropped by to grab a drink And snacks after a long day. The location is great and convenient but the food is basic nothing interesting so service is what takes a place like this over the top but they didn‚Äôt get that! The waitress had the worst attitude and doesn‚Äôt belong in the service industry. When I spoke to the manager she apologized that her server was having a bad day and justified her behaviour!?!?! She made no attempt to rectify the rude service but and as the saying goes, ‚Äúthe fish smells from the head‚Äù. This place could hv so much potential due to its location but it‚Äôs empty and I‚Äôm by there at least a few times a week. Will avoid at all cost. We work hard to earn our money, last thing we need is to spend it where the food is average and the service is way below! Also bathrooms are atrocious!  Hope you hv a better experience."

        "I have been working downtown in Queen West for three years and have always passed by Rivoli but never went in until today.  Man, I wish I would have just kept walking.  They're menu is pretty slim, with few options, it's mostly a bar as their drink menu is much more extensive.  Our server was pleasant enough, and I have no complaints about his attitude.  However, he never informed me that the drinks were not refillable which I had assumed (at $3 for a simple iced tea, who wouldn't think that they were refillable).  Anyhow, as he was passing by our table, he asked me if I wanted another, of course I said yes, thinking that I wouldn't be charged another $3 (which I was).  Our food took a long time (we were late getting back to the office).  I had ordered sweet potato fries with my burger which were burnt, I didn't eat them.  When I told him, he asked if I wanted another order, I didn't because we needed to get back to work.  To my surprise, I was still charged extra for the fries and also charged for the little ramekin of dipping sauce that he asked me if I wanted with my fries (also not informing that there would be a charge for).  In the end, my bill was almost $21, basically for a mediocre burger and two iced teas!  I will never go back and will encourage others to do so as well.  There are far better places to eat on Queen Street."

        "The Rivoli has been around since at least the 1970s but has recently come under new management.  I saw a piece done on it on CBC News so thought we'd try it out.  We sat on the patio which is located right on busy Queen St.  It was great for people watching.  We had to wait a few minutes before the server came to ask us for drinks.  She needed to wipe down the table first and did so but without any comment.  She seemed a bit surly to start with, certainly wasn't friendly.  She gave us the menus and I was very surprised at how limited it was.  I had the pad thai because that was what was shown on the news and it looked good.  My partner had the salad with a side of grilled chicken.  I had a beer ($6.95) and he had a Martini ($ 10.95).  The Pad Thai was $ 11 and change (not bad) but the salad was $9.00 and the small piece of chicken was an added $ 5.00.  Perhaps it's just that we are not used to Queen St. prices, but it certainly seemed over priced for what we got.  The price for the two of us with our drinks and tip came to just over $ 50.00 and my partner was still hungry.  It certainly was not of the same caliber as the Rivoli that I remember from my U. of T. days.  Don't think we'll return any time soon.  Biggest disappointment was the menu with it's VERY limited choice."

The mac&Cheese are not better....it's just extra over cooked pasta (not even maccheroni) with greasy butter and water.... should I go on? There are so many good option close by, avoid this place!"

Food was average for the area but above average for a pool hall/lounge.  The atmosphere seems a bit grungy but I like that so it was cool.  If you're looking for something a but more posh king street isn't too far away.  Overall I thought it was decent especially since I find most of the queen spots to be crap."

They had a reasonable selection of beers although their liquor selections were fine but not top shelf (no Patron or Belvedere).

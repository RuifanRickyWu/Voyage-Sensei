It turned out to be the best city tour we had ever done including all of the travels my wife and I do abroad. Will Olson has an encyclopedic knowledge and understanding of the Denver urban core. We did the LoDo and RiNo tours and his knowledge of the buildings, neighborhoods, history, restaurants, chefs, artists and murals is amazing. What's more, he delivers the tour in a very entertaining way: Humorous, articulate and captivating. I would highly recommend this tour to anyone, but I would recommend doing it at the beginning of your trip even more than the end as you will be able to use the information to plan your entire culinary and beverage experience during your stay.

        "Lokafy's tag line is \"a Toronto-based startup that offers unscripted, personalized walking tours that are like having a friend show you around the city. We work with passionate locals, not professional guides.\" So that's what we were expecting when we booked with them for a tour of the city of Rouen, France. Unfortunately, though our guide, Louise, was friendly and sweet, it was amazing how much she DIDN'T know about her own city. It made us all wonder if she really lived there. She seemed to have NO passion, let alone, curiosity about certain things, for example this amazing multi-colored contemporary building that had been built in the port area the year before (Turned out to be the headquarters of Métropole Rouen Normandie which I had to look up ) If a building like that went up in my city I'd know what it was, but her answer was \"I'm not sure\" This seemed to be her answer a good bit of the time. We had told her that we'd like to be shown the art gallery section of town and she took us to a street that had antique shops but no art. We later found that street on our own. She showed us the two important cathedrals (even though we had said we'd do those on our own)  but had no relevant information about them and she in fact got some of the historical facts wrong. We were shown the very interesting Altre Saint Maclou which is being renovated and used to house and bury the victims of the Black Plague and then became an art school. I asked what it would be after the renovation was complete and she didn't know, so looked it up (to find it would become an attraction) We were constantly looking at our phones trying to find out answers. Really we couldn't wait for the tour to be over. She offered to go into the Joan of Arc museum/tour and find out the hours and I asked if she would find out if we should buy a ticket right then. She came out and said no we could just come back for the last tour at 4 PM but when we did it was sold out! so I was very disappointed. I'm not sure if that was her fault or if she just was given wrong information. When we still had 30 minutes left on our tour she seemed at a loss as  to what to see next, so we cut the tour short. She ended up walking with us back to the area we wanted to explore more, where we paid her and said our goodbyes.The four of us were-as we always are- very pleasant but she had to sense our frustration.  As I am writing this, I am just hearing from my husband that she was given a ten euro tip (which was low for us but all we felt she deserved) She took it, but then walked back and said that the minimum tip was 20. No where on the site does it even say the tip is mandatory.  This is the very first time I've ever given a guide a bad review but if this young lady wants to continue showing tourists around her city she should get out her schoolbooks or spend some time on the internet learning some basic facts."

        "Felipe Da Sousa guided us around Tokyo on a five hour tour on a Sunday. His knowledge of the Japanese was excellent and he told us many insightful things about their culture and mannerisms. He  took us to an unbelievable park where people were involved in a myriad of different activities-it was fascinating.On the way to the park we walked through a \"crazY\" street where we saw animal cafes, people dressed up in amazing outfits. I thought I was at Alice in Wonderland mad hatter's party. His  English is excellent and we were thrilled with our day. HIGHLY recommended!!!"

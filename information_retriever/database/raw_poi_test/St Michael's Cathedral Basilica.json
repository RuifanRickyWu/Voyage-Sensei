Be sure to line up early as the priest may not be able to reach everyone before he needs to prepare for Sunday service at 5pm. The evening service does not have the boys choir and instead is led by a cantor. The gothic style is very conducive for meditating, and as you admire stained glass windows and the vaulted ceilings, you can glimpse the bishop's hat, hung way above the alter, attributable to the 1st bishop, Michael Power."

      "text": [
        "I know this area of downtown Toronto as I have walked through the streets on my way to several destinations. I have walked past the basilica and I will say that it is a large church well worth your time to see and visit. My familiarity with Young and surrounding streets is good enough to qualify me to say something about the church. Going back to earlier parts of this century I have watched renovations take place. I am not a member of the church's group of worshipers. I will not comment about the interior. I like to see how older looking churches fit into the modern urban landscape that includes taller buildings and sky scrapers. I like to see how these older looking buildings continue to hold their attraction for drawing visitors to see them. I do not pass up a chance to explore on foot downtown Toronto each time I am there. So I walked along the streets. I knew about Church street from finding it once or twice further up north near the Bloor Street interchange with Young. But here it was near the downtown area of Toronto -closer to areas that I had seen just by being close the U of T region and I was curious to know how it measures up with the cathedrals I had seen in Europe. So I am looking at the exterior. There is much to be said about how the construction and architectural style of the cathedral makes the entire church fit in the urban landscape that surrounds it. The contrast in the function and purposes of the surrounding buildings is another issue. Banks and financial centers and commercial retail stores offer more than just a functional contrast with cathedrals. I did find it to be beautiful as a principal landmark for the city. Yes, it looks impressive in this location. I have never worshipped there but I was interested during my walking tours of downtown Toronto in 2016 and before to look at this structure from the standpoint of how it fits in the urban landscape. I had been walking in this part of Toronto in earlier years so I was familiar with street names and building locations. Yes, I did make comparisons with famous cathedrals that I had seen in many European cities. My interest was in its external architectural style. Was it out of place today? In many ways downtown regions need a variety of building styles. I did go back more than three times to see it from different vantage points. I did walk along King Street and Queen Street and I knew where Adelaide Street was in relation to Young Street. Many of my observations are coming together to be close to forming a conclusion about this question. Did I see or look for flying buttresses? How exact were my comparisons with cathedral of European cities? Does a cathedral like this one alway have to be located in a large city? An element of city planning was involved in my thinking. The age of Toronto compared with much older european cities was also a factor for me to consider. Certain question remain to be answered. Tell me what you think. It might not be fair to compare this basilica with Chartres or the large church in Cologne or Notre Dame in Paris by looking only at their external appearance and location."

We spent a couple hours walking though the Cathedral and looking at all the information regarding the stained glass windows and other items.  The place had just finished an extensive refurbishment and it showed. We wish we could have seen more detailed pics of the Church prior to all the rehab work. The history is very interesting and certainly helps provide some perspective to this incredible building. Even though it’s in the heart of the downtown area, parking was easy. It’s a little pricey but after all we’re in a major metropolitan area. The outside landscaping was in the process of being completed so at first glance, it looks as if the rehab is incomplete. Not so, as the inside is completely finished. "

The simple yet intricate worship space with a sky blue base really brought me home.  I was also a little wistful with kneelers (!), and passing of the basket.  And the stained glass is something to look at even if you aren't there for mass.  Just beautiful and serene and very European.",

Mass was not long, but also not rushed, and while Father didn't bring us the message of the Homily with any unique or personal stories, he communicated his message.",

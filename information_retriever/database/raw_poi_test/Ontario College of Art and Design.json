        "The feat of the modern architectural thought, the Sharp Centre for Design, is the joint work of the famous British architect Will Alsop in partnership with Toronto-based Robbie/Young + Wright Architects. The design received many influential awards and praises of the world architectural and engineering organizations.   ",
        "Looking to the south, down McCaul St, enjoy the view of the CN Tower. ",
        "Please bear in mind that this amazing building doesn't require a tour, admission, or exploring its interior; it can be simply viewed as a stop of your tour of Toronto."

You can wander inside and check out the interior design  but it is a working art school so be prepared to mingle with the tattooed and coloured hair sported by quite a few of the students. Worth checking out if you are in the area."

SAIC even has a film festival when students present their work that goes on for days. OCAD is just sad and empty. Walk down the street to U of T and avoid this stop...lame."

A white oblong shaped box with black checkers it is, supported by multiple tilted brightly coloured joists as if part of it is hanging in the air housing classrooms etc.  I walked back and forth along the street to admire the creativity and somehow it came across my mind that yes we should try to think outside the box and sky is the limit.

You can actually walked into the existing building and looked around. An elevator will take you from the existing building to the top floors. Not much at the top floors - just many classrooms. You can go to the windows of the classrooms - when they are not used - to see the city from this building. Then come down to walked around this one of a kind place. Best of all, it costs you nothing."

        "The COC really struggles with the visual part of performances - many classic operas are staged with either industrial simple \"grey-black & red spot\" or pale brownish (also simplistic background). One might wonder if the decorators have only 2 options in mind. Occasionally for model operas, the director goes wild and over-decorates everything, so I wonder if there is hate to classics here. My favourite opera, Barber of Seville suffered there not only from the lack of practically any decor (COC put this Barocco-times opera into an empty grey space with just red grand-piano on the stage) but also from brutal handling of its beautiful music. Last Saturday they had an Italian female over-caffeinated conductor that seemed like worrying about attention to herself, considering over-gesturing than about the quality of music. She runs all music almost twice faster than it should be so poor professional (and usually great) orchestra barely had time to play complex passes. Singers had to mumble and not sing the music, as it was simply no time. The opening scene didn't come with much voicing as the singer was not up to the job, and the key Rosina's aria at the 2nd act. was rather mumbled as well. And this is what they do to the best opera ever... Very disappointing..."

        "Operas usually invite top singers, this is great but decor... are they that poor or color blind? But why 3 stars here is their ballet - ok, they try hard, I see how much they try but, Karen (director), please teach dancers to do tough ballet, including splits. The decor is also not there. The worth experience was, however when they have blue background and white-dressed dancers come, good music, group dancing, nice white-blue contrast but they are not synchronized, just about but not there. They can't even wave hands up and down in synchrony, forget jumping or lifting legs. It's painful to watch :(  The public, of course, like the dresses and applouses for anything. Today's orchestra at the 3rd performance was awful, I don't understand how it can be allowed, in 3 places - usually their orchestra is superb. This added to pain, and the tickets are not cheap - 250$. If they economize on decor and training, I wonder where do the money go to?"

However, the ushers should be empowered to ask patrons to cover up skimpy and see through clothing which are better for a nightclub than a Sunday afternoon at the opera. A female patron wore a pink slip dress with no underwear. She should have been asked to cover up."

        "So there's a European way of presenting it, and a North American way.  The COC is among the best at the North American way.  The North American way assumes that one is building an audience, that many people have seen very few operas, and that one must not stray far from the composer's original concept or the audience will get lost; yet that there's also a part of the audience that is hungry for an up-to-date, thoughtful interpretation of the story.  Operas written before Freud about topics such as incest can never be presented again the way they were before Freud.  Slavery was understood differently in the 1860s (e.g. during the American civil war) than in the 2010s.  So how to engage the experienced audience without losing the audience that's dipping their toes in the operatic water?  The COC walks this fine line better than anyone.",
        "Every season, there are three groups of opera, two pairs and a triple.  The groups are chosen by theme.",
        "The most recent three performances--Carmelites, Salome, and Lucia, have \"losing your head\" as the theme.  The nuns of the Order of Carmelites, in the French Revolution, continue to dialogue about the truth they believe and lose their heads by being guillotined.  In Salome, John the Baptist also continues to speak what he believes is the truth and gets his head chopped off at Salome's request by Herod's guards.  The head is placed, still dripping blood, in an acryllic salad bowl and given to Salome, who does a French kiss on its mouth, something that John the Baptist was not allowing while the head was still attached to his body.  Lucia di Lammermoor speaks the truth about whom she loves, and loses her head in the ordinary meaning of the world--she goes mad from stress--and ultimately drowns in the garden fountain.",
        "The previous pair of operas was the Clemency of Titus by Mozart, and Tristan and Isolde by Wagner.  The theme was betrayal.  Titus is a tremendously generous Emperor who would not believe anything but the best about anyone without firm evidence but is nevertheless betrayed by one he loves; King Marke in T&I is a tremendously generous King of Cornwall who gives everything he can to his protegee, Tristan, and is betrayed by him.  The emotions are gut-wrenching.  Should these operas be presented as if the only interpretation is that the action happened centuries ago?  Or can they be brought into our present to allow us to feel even more poignantly the sting of betrayal?  COC does really, really well with its interpretations.",
        "COC uses its limited budget for the things that matter--great voices, an excellent orchestra, and an acceptable conceptualisation of each opera.",
        "COC is not Stadtoper or Volksoper Wien or any of the three Berlin operas, but neither are its audiences, nor the governments that fund it.  Given the inputs, Canadians can be proud of how well their national opera company produces outputs!",

        "My wife and I expected much from this, given the buzz that had surrounded Dmitri Tcherniakov's production. We were disappointed. The singing was great, with Russell Braun as the Don and Kyle Ketelsen as Leporello heading a very strong cast. The orchestra was also excellent. The production, however, was static, mystifying and boring. When a director explains his conception, you must hope that it becomes apparent on the stage. In this case it didn't, partly because the libretto contradicted the conception, and partly because the decision to stage everything in the Commendatore's library undermined the action. My wife left at the intermission; so did several other people in our area. I stayed because the music is gorgeous and the singers delightful, and because I wanted to see how the deception scene worked in Tcherniakov's version. It didn't, because Donna Elvira was clearly not deceived. This was only one of many mystifying touches in this production. Another: if Zerlina is Donna Anna's daughter, why is she referred to as \"a peasant girl\"? I could go on. ",
        "Having recently attended Robert Falls's superb production of Don Giovanni in Chicago and Joel Ivany's delightful adaptation of the opera in #Uncle John, Tcherniakov's production struck me as pretty thin beer. Obviously there were those who liked it (though I'm puzzled why), but when the director appeared for his bow I heard boos, unusual at the Four Seasons Centre.",
        "Musically excellent, dramatically inadequate; call the combined result average."

        "I used to frequent the COC when they first set up shop and while I don't want to discredit the performers whatsoever, I can't say the experience is that great anymore. The Four Seasons venue is great, very modern--definitely not your old school European opera house, which is good or bad, depending on who you ask.",
        "The opera is hardly sacred around here anymore...the costumes often have a Rocky Horror-ness about it and I've noticed the past few times I've gone to see a performance, not only has wardrobe seemingly taken cutbacks, but so too have the sets! I don't understand how this is even possible as ticket prices aren't going down and patronage hasn't wained from what I can see (unless I'm just attending uber-popular shows), so I can't help but feel I'm being gouged. Thank goodness there's still the LED screen with lyrics as there'd be no other way of following the story!"

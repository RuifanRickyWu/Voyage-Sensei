Nonetheless, I really didn’t like how there is smoking allowed on board. It was a very hot day and being outside was the only relief. But there were smokers everywhere. They were also throwing their butts in the water which really bothers me. The food was also mediocre as it was dry/salty and no forks we’re available."

I took my boyfriend for his birthday. the food was amazing! however, although it was a Hawaiian theme, there was never any Hawaiian music and I think they could have done it up a bit more to feel like a Hawaiian cruise. There was not very many people aboard, but none the less, it was relaxing and so cool to see the City from a different view! I would definitely do this again!"

Nothing wrong with it, but nothing worth standing in line for.  When they said \"finger food\" I didn't expect ripple potato chips.",

The yacht is very nice and the staff very helpful.  There were many visitors who had never been to Toronto before and we, even though we have lived in the Oshawa area for many years, have never been to the island and around the harbour.  The only thing missing from our cruise was an historical commentary telling us where we were and what we were seeing.  It certainly would have made this an excellent cruise."

A DJ played music throughout the evening and there is a dance floor but as the crew announced, dancing is acceptable anywhere.  Our table was next to the dance floor and speakers and we found it quite difficult to have have conversation with other friends at our table due to the volume of the music. We did not complain or mention it to the crew. We might have been able to move to another table. Washroom are downstairs and not accessible for those in a wheelchair. Maybe there were accommodations in that case. Overall a great evening enjoying food, friends, and the Toronto waterfront."

The food was amazing especially the brisket, but I think due to a low number of guests they underestimated how much food to make.  That was a little disappointing.

        "The boat was clean and well presented.  The staff was courteous but rarely present.  When you board the boat there are staff members walking around with appetizers (in our case...spring rolls and meatballs). The spring rolls were delicious but the meatballs were cold and bland. The wait staff only carried about 12 spring rolls at a time to feed a hundred people. When the tray was empty, she had to go back downstairs and refill. The same could be said about the meatballs. This process took a long time and in the end our table received one spring roll and one meatball each. It was a frustrating process. The bar was no different.  After waiting in line for 35 minutes, you paid for overpriced drinks and the beer was warm and the pop was flat and syrupy.  When dinner was finally served, they asked the patrons on the second floor to be fed first, however we watched as people from the main deck also had gone up to get food. This is not the fault of the staff but rather than ignorance of the patrons. The main floor was never called to wait in line for food So eventually we just all got up and moved into the food line. We had already waited approximately 45 minutes and then had a nother 40 minute wait standing in line. The food consisted of buns, mixed green salad, rice, steamed mixed vegetables, thin Teriyaki steak and chicken breast. The food quality was subpar. The buns did not taste fresh, the rice was bland, the steamed vegetables were undercooked even for steamed vegetables,  the Teriyaki steak was paper thin and the chicken lacked flavour. My son was very hungry and was told he could go up for seconds, when he went up they had already cleared the food with the exception of the Buns so he grabbed a couple of those to make do. A few hours later, dessert was put out consisting of brownies fruit and apple crisp. Everyone was told that you were only allowed to have one piece of dessert. I did not get any dessert before it was gone but i understand that the fruit and brownies were good.  As for the music, it was typical club music.  It was blaring and did not cater to the patrons which was evident by the lack of participation on the dance floor.  The city scape at night was the only saving grace. For most of the evening I was hoping for a dinghy to come and take me back to land so I could end the miserable night.  If i were you i would take a pass.  "

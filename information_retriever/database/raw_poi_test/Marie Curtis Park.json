  "description": "Etobicoke is a relaxed area along the Humber River. It's saturated with green spaces and conservatories, making it a premier destination for outdoor sports, hiking, and nature walks. Its abundance of parkland and lakes makes it a typical spot for fishing, picnicking, and camping out, especially in warmer months. The peaceful area is also enjoyed by families, who appreciate its boardwalks and sports facilities. Locals enjoy the variety of golfing and country club opportunities, which also provide lessons for golfers of any skill level.",

        "We live less than 5kms away but have never been to Marie Curtis Park before. My family agreed to a Sunday morning visit in early July as we were curious to see this nearby Toronto park which boasts a public swimming beach. I read that there are even lifeguards on duty.",
        "There were plenty of parking spots available when we got here around 8:15AM. The weather forecast may have something to do with the half empty parking lot as it was a slightly cool day and rain was expected before noon. We headed for the pier and immediately came across the temporary fencing surrounding what was supposedly the wooden boardwalk area. According to the project signage, construction work should be finished in August 2021. We walked back, past the public washrooms and food concessionaire (Sunset Beach Cafe) to get to the beach. The beach was not much to look at and was littered with garbage. The water looked terribly polluted. I cannot imagine anyone swimming in it. ",
        "From the beach, we explored the park until we reached the bridge over Etobicoke Creek. Nearly all recyclable and garbage bins inside the park were full to overflowing with yesterday's trash. It was a relief to finally see a city garbage truck doing what was likely a scheduled morning collection. There is ample green space and shade for a family picnic though not a lot of picnic tables. The more popular spots seemed to be those near the creek and the splash pad. There are 2 group picnic areas which require a permit--picnic area 1 is to the north of the park while picnic area 2 is closer to the parking lot. One thing I like about Marie Curtis Park is the Etobicoke Creek recreation trail. Its winding path parallel to the creek, surrounded by plenty of big shady trees, is just perfect for a relaxing stroll, bike ride or dog walk. ",
        "Pros:  recreation trail, free parking, splash pad, playground, public washrooms, food concessionaire",
        "Cons: overflowing bins, fenced off construction area, beach litter, polluted water"

It can be very busy, but there is lots to do.. playgrounds, picnics, beach, some like to swim here.. boat launch, fishing, trails.  During the day the park hosts day camps but there is lots of room for everyone.  The only issue is the shape of the parking lot and drive into the parking area.  badly needs repair and maintenance."

        "Marie Curtis Park Beach is located on the east bank of the Etobicoke Creek. It was a lovely unexpected find. Marie Curtis Park Beach is exactly what a local park and beach should be - fun for walking, hiking, biking, relaxing on the beach, fishing and great photo opps as well. From Toronto it can be reached by the Queen streetcar line. You can explore some nature trails and wooded paths with lovely bridges that cross it. It is a everyday place for the people who live nearby, it's relaxing just to sit there and watch the world go by. That is what makes Marie Curtis Park Beach so special."

        "Went on a Thursday early afternoon with four kids. It was not busy at all. The beach was nice though the water right at the shore had a fair bit of algae; not sure if that's typical of Lake Ontario beaches. The kids played in it anyway. The lifeguards were friendly and attentive. Once the kids had played enough at the beach, we moved to have lunch under the nearby trees. Then we went into the sizeable splash pad and play area just beyond the parking lot. There was a little place selling some refreshments, we had brought our own lunch/snacks so didn't check it out. We had an excellent time."

The Waterfront Trail is well marked from here into Toronto. Approximately 20k to Queens Quay. Only downside is the park entrance is not signed so you’ll likely drive past the west entrance the first time you go."

        "Make sure to pick up your garbage though- it's very easy to be responsible about your litter and waste, the park is quite generously filled with garbage AND recycling bins. Anything you leave behind WILL blow straight into our aquatic lives habitats. ",
        "Lots of places to sit and soak in the beauty, there are a handful of entryways into the park. Beautiful songbirds coat the woodland with peaceful melodies. Chipmunks also occupy the area! As well as Coyote's, chipmunks, raccoons, etc.",
        "Truly a place for everyone! It aslo extends into a beautiful creek, which is absolutely worth following the trails into discovering more of Etobicoke Valley Park. ",
        "It leads farther into following the creek, but it is currently closed off from entry as the rocks are all falling down into the creek, which isn't safe for the public at the moment. But it could easily turn into a 3 hour (give or take depending on how far you want to go, and how fast you walk etc) adventure from the beginning of Marie Curtis Park, all the way to Etobicoke Valley Park. It is just enchanting!"

There is a playground, two colour children’s labyrinth with a push-button activated spiral water fountain, a public swimming beach, a dog off-leash area, picnic spots and walking trails which connects to the Waterfront Trail along the lake-side. This place very close to the Dixie Outlet mall, is absolutely beautiful, you don’t have to drive too far to get here either. Throughout this park you can find an abundance of wildlife and native plants. ",

        "The beach has lovely sand and is mounted with a 32 pounder cannon. The waterfront is really something and we enjoyed taking pictures and watching the waves hitting the shore. Apart from the washrooms being extremely filthy and stinking, all of us absolutely loved the place and we will definitely be planning to visit again."

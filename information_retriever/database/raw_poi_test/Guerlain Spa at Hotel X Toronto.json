The spa is beautiful and the staff are professional and welcoming. The facial offered a perfect combination of relaxation and hydration. My skin was glowing afterwards - it felt like the last couple of cold winter months causing dry skin and redness had been eliminated & replenished; days after I am still reaping the benefits. Highly recommend this spa and treatment! Looking forward to booking another service with them!"

It was by far the most comprehensive full body massage I’ve gotten at any of the major Toronto spas (e.g. includes a stomach massage which I haven’t had done before). The scents to choose from are all great and beds are very comfortable. After the service they have amazing macarons to enjoy in their lounge chairs. The only negative I can think of is the size of the change rooms. Compared to other spas I’ve been to they are quite small but didn’t matter much to me."

The treatments are fabulous, Julie and Shana are very professional, the spa is gorgeous, and the lounge service with prosecco (or a choice of tea) and something sweet (macaroon, or cream eclair, or a tiny muffin)  is just a perfect finish to this amazing experience.  We drive almost 100 km from Grimsby to Toronto for this indulgence.  And let's not forget the spa front desk team, and spa attendants who take us from the reception area; everyone is just very pleasant and attentive.  Highly recommend this spa."

My husband, who normally does not particularly care for massages, really enjoyed his massage with Shana.  She was so friendly, informative and knew exactly which muscle groups to target and work on. I suffer from extremely tense muscles and always require deep muscle massages.  Marcelo was fantastic and helped alleviate all the tightness in my muscles.  I highly recommend both of them!!",

The massage she provided was wonderful but also the continued attention she provided after the massage was highly appreciated. I mentioned being interested in a perfume, so she chose perfumes based on my preferences. She was amazing and deserves a lot of credit for the experience provided at the spa. ",

The attendant wasn’t able to answer my question on the phone so she took my name and number and offered to call me back. She didn’t call me back. A month later, I called back with the same inquiry. The individual",

I made her aware that I previously provided my name/number with no response. She stated that she will in fact return my call. Low and behold, I received no response for a second time. That initial encounter left a bad taste in my mouth and I hadn’t even visited the spa yet. ",
        "The spa itself does not compared to many of the other hotel spas in Toronto (shangri la, four seasons, the ritz). Absolutely no products are provided for post shower use. No combs, no brushes, not even moisturizer or deodorant. I was quite surprised to see that. ",

Abruptly after 30 minutes in the lounge after our massages we were told our time in the lounge was up and that it was time to leave.  It was disappointing as we had hoped to spend the day together.  As a non-hotel guest, we did NOT have access to the pool or roof top restaurant.  Other spas at luxury hotels allow you to use their services for the day.  We will be choosing a different spa for our next sisters get together where we can actually spend the day together. ",

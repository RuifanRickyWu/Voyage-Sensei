        "I was at the pub yesterday with 2 more friends because we love the selection of beers that they have. We asked to seat and the host point a table for us. The server was kind of rude talking to us when we asked for a few more minutes to decide what to drink. He never said good night or smile anytime talking with us. At the end of our night he just grabed my glass and walked away without even look at the table    After that we ask for the bill and payed for it. One of my friends was still finishing her drink when a lady showed up and asked us to leave. We didn't understand what was happening and she said that they have a reservation for that table at 10h45pm (and they had lots of tables free at the moment). We told her that we're finishing (was around 10h30) and she told us that we can finish inside if we wanted. We left, of course. It was rude, and at any moment they told us that they had a reservation. Again, lots of tables we're empty and even then she asked us to leave or go inside the pub. We went there a few times already and we're not going back after that."

        "The German beer is extraordinary good but not cold enough, need to be. And when I order prezels and dips, I expect prezels and different dips, not half a plate of salad and tomato slices and only two prezels with cream cheese.  By the way the prezels were exactly like in Germany so why not putting one more on the plate and add swiss cheese and leave all the salad.",

The tables were small but big enough for what we ordered.  The beer selection was amazing.  I had the chicken schnitzel and my husband had a sandwich and fries.  It was all very good.  This is good people watching location.  There are other restaurants nearby and an ice cream place called \"Sweet Jesus.\"  It had a huge line!  We asked someone what it was for, they said ice cream.  Must be Great ice cream.  We didn't get to try it :("

When the meal came it had lots of fish & it was a big meal&.I really enjoyed the meal, i started paying attention to the other meals being served and everything looked good.  They had a upper floor with seating & a bar. The day I was there only the downstairs section was open & they have a few tables outside. They have a very small washroom for a good sized restaurant  & the toilet seat  was very loose & nearly falling off. They had lots of European beers, I only noticed a few Ontario beers on the menu."

The food was good and despite the crowds the wait staff were very friendly and efficient. We were upstairs but downstairs looked to be more interestingly decorated. The tables are really packed in but again you don't feel too cramped. If you like a great lively atmosphere, the Town Crier is a good choice."

They do have a wine list as well. Food was good and decently priced with a fair amount of vegetarian items. Service was polite and prompt. The space is cozy as tables are very close together but the decor is beautiful! I didn't venture upstairs but it looked like a room that could be rented out for functions? It was a very mixed group of people, businessmen, couples, groups of friends. This place seems to have something for everyone."

  "description": "Midtown is a dynamic part of Toronto with some of its most stylish high-rise residences and heritage buildings. The area sees busy shoppers with bag-laden arms balancing lattes in paper cups as they travel from one luxury brand to the next, taking advantage of the proximity of high-end shops. The reflecting pools, jogging trails, and nature treks of the Rosehill Revision are always a hub of outdoor activity, and after a workout from either running or splurging, many take advantage of the spas and massage parlors Midtown has to offer. Away from the bakeries, boutiques, and glamorous old theaters of the district's center, locals use the weekend to embrace the more suburban feel of Midtown's parks, tennis courts, outdoor markets, and the manicured grounds of Casa Loma, while families indulge the area's state-of-the-art playground and learning facilities. Of course, no high-brow district is complete without a healthy counter-culture: Midtown boasts some of the wildest street art and full-wall graffiti of any neighborhood in Toronto.",

        "For a November afternoon it was balmy (19C) and the Belt Line is a pleasant walk. It's better in summer when the shade of the trees flanking this walk is welcome. In the fall, the direct sun is mostly screened off by the houses on the south side. Still, we enjoyed our one-hour-plus walk, starting from Oriole Parkway almost to Eglinton and then back again."

        "The Beltline as part of a loop that includes the Lower Don trail makes a challenging, but very enjoyable run right from downtown Toronto.  You would hardly know you're right in the heart of Canada's biggest city, but Toronto has many such bits of trails.  The Beltline is an old electric train route. The northerly part is relatively flat, but the bit that connects close to the Don is quite hilly. .  "

I have been on the Beltline in both summer and winter and like the winter best.  It is normally very quiet, with fewer people. You can access the Beltline from either Mt. Pleasant Road, Avenue Road or Lascelles  Blvd."

Get walk as well. "

        "This is a lovely green space running through Midtown Toronto for 9 km. Although it was a dame day, we have walked in worse in the UK, so we ventured out to explore this trail. it is a narrow trail built on an unused rail line, so it is level without hills on most of the trail. You do have to stop for streets and it is sometime difficult to cross, and the trail is interrupted at times by major roads, but is still a great walk in downtown Toronto. ",
        "Oh . . .  the train-spotting dog . . . the trail is used by many dog owners, many who do not follow the \"Keep your dog on leash\" rule, but the little dog we met on the Yonge St. bridge was on a leash, and he was eagerly awaiting the subway train which passes under the bridge. His tail waged as the train approached and he rushed to the other side of the bridge as the train disappeared into the Davisville station. His owner reported that this \"Train-spotting\" is his favourite activity and does it every day. So if you walk the trail look for the Amazing \"Train-Spotting\" dog."

It’s wide enough for many people and many modes of transport to co-exist. Lovely year-round, but not maintained in winter, so make sure you’re wearing sturdy boots with plenty of traction. Very dark at night so best to keep an eye on the time. ",

Once a railway line servicing outer ring of Toronto in 1890's, this 4.5km pathway has been a favorite spot for folks to enjoy a little nature in the city. Families, runners and dog owners take full advantage of this well maintained city green space. Easily accessible & fountains conveniently located are a nice touch. Highly recommend this little walkway to relax and decompress.",

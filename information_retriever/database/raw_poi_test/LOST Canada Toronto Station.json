  "description": "LOST Canada is a series of reality escape rooms which is a physical adventure game where players are locked inside pre-set scenarios rooms. The escapers are limited to use only the elements inside the game along with their abilities to find clues, solve puzzles, and perform actions in order to escape within 45 minutes. The goal is to excel their “cognition”, “communication”, “cooperation”, and “observation” skills while having a great time. Started in 2013, headquarter located in Hong Kong branching out to 8 different locations in Australia, Canada, China, Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, United Arab Emirates and Vietnam.",

        "Our group selected the Alcatraz escape room. We were given a two sentence backstory before we were locked in a jail cell. We were not told that there were clues outside of the jail cell as we  asked if the cell was separate from the rest of the room it opened up to so we wasted a good chunk of time before we were told the whole room was in play. The employee placed 40 minutes on the clock rather than the 45 their website advertises and we were on the last clue when the timer ran out. So we assumed the employee would come give us a clue and our remaining time, instead she just came in and told us the last step (which we were in the middle of). Overall, we will not be returning as this location is not worth the price."

        "My 1 star rating, though was because there are total fire code violations. You get locked in a jail cell, for example, in the Alcatraz room... and there is no emergency escape button. You legit cannot get out unless you complete the puzzle (which is shooting a laser to hit 8 targets... I'm spoiling this because if you're in there you need to know). They need to fix this ASAP before someone gets hurt. Even if they fix the fire code problems, I don't think I'd give it more than a 2 star. I should have checked escroomaddict.com before going."

        "Went here last month with some co-workers for fun activity after work. There were 8 of us, so we didn't really have much choice to which rooms we could pick from. However, that didn't seem to matter because we all had fun. It was definitely more challenging than we had all thought it would be. We had to use up each of the 3 hints throughout the allotted time. In the end though, we made it out just as the timer was going off.",
        "Pros: fun, challenging, scary, entertaining. Obviously this can change depending on the people you have with you, but overall this is a good experience.",

Definitely check out this escape room company if you're in the area.  "

        "We played with a group of 4 - 2 couples. 1 couple had lots of escape room and experience and the other had none. We were initially impressed because the stairs played notes as you walked up, and that was kind of fun. However, then we started the Royal Cemetary Game.  There wasn't really much of a backstory, which turned into the smallest of problems. When we started playing, locks started randomly triggering and then continuously beeping. It wasn't really possible to tell if we had completed a puzzle or if a door opened for some other reason. The gamemaster couldn't even tell us if it was supposed to open at that point. Some of the puzzles had broken and were held together with duct tape. The potential was there but the extremely lousy execution means I would not recommend this escape room."

        "At the time of writing this review, my group had completed approximately 20 escape games. We found this place while in the neighbourhood and was the only place that had availability. Going up to the room had really cool steps that played a note when taking each step. We did the Gallery Codex room. The room itself was a little worn, but the puzzles inside were well thought through and made logical sense. There was a little hiccup in one part when we opened one of the locks, where a key was supposed to be, it wasn't. The room was not properly set up. This itself was probably not that big of deal, but trying to contact the game master took a few tries. There seemed to be only one game master for several rooms. He did seem like he was overwhelmed dealing with other groups. I wouldn't preclude myself from going back again to see what the other rooms were like, but be prepared with figuring the stuff out without timely clues."

The challenge was 45 mins long, pretty expensive for a badly designed escape challenge company, I can't imagine how bad I would have felt if we had paid full price.",
        "The room contained a magnetically locked prison cell that we started in.  The room was broken and the cell would not open when we solved it.  After the (very helpful and nice) attendant told us to try a few times, without luck, she came in to help.  She tried to turn off the power to disengage the magnetic lock and that did not work.  She called the owner who told her that we had to climb onto the cell, open the ceiling and unplug the lock.",

        "A group of 14 of us went to Lost Canada to see what this new \"Escape Room\" fad was all about.  We booked 3 escape rooms and we split up into groups.  None of us had ever been to an escape room before so we had absolutely no idea what to expect.  I was in a group with 3 other friends and were shown the room.  We were asked if we had any questions.  Uhm, ya, what do we do??!!  She said, I suggest you start here.  We were never told we were looking for things that had a four digit code.  We thought there might be notes or something as clues.  Nope, everything is code.  Would have been nice to know that - and the number of digits.  It also would have been nice to get a brief overview of the theme of the room as that may have helped.  Even the \"clues\" you get (2) if you press an intercom button were completely obscure and difficult to figure out.  And we signed up for the \"easy\" rooms.  They really should give more direction/information and not assume people know what to do when they get into the room.  Simply providing that information is helpful for the newbies, and if someone's been to an escape room before, they can skip that.  Considering the price of these things is approximately $30 per person, I expected much more."

Thank goodness that nothing was seriously wrong since we were locked in the room and couldn't get out with no response from him.",

We didn't even make it through half of the challenges before our time ran out.  The different aspects of the escape were not at all intuitive which made it very frustrating.  When we asked how many people actually successfully made it out, they said 20% but I find that even hard to believe."

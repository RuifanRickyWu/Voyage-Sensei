        "There's nothing really here to possibly recommend.  Empty steel overhead canopies when the farmer's market is not on (surely they could set up something mid-week).  And the other building is an empty warehouse.  Lots of cement, very little \"brick\".  No exhibits or spectacular architecture.  Not enough outdoor seating, nor spread out.  Parking machine did not accept cash or credit card, due July 15, 2024 flood, so had to scan bar code.  Paid $8.33 for 90 minutes parking.  Did they replace accessibility parking with carpool parking?  One plus is the nice view from self-serve restaurant.  Pleasant staff, but woefully understaffed during long weekend, so that was most of our time.  Food prices are fairly high.  Country store has overpriced items, that people really don't need.  Washroom had two out-of-service hand dryers, and unattended.  Disappointing for a place with so much potential.  Misses the mark on many levels."

It’s a lovely way to get out of the city and getting a taste of nature without having to go too far. The extended park area allows you to explore far enough that you never really feel that it gets too crowded even on weekends. I went in the end of October and the fall foliage was perfect. There is also the farmers and food market which adds to the element of fun. I would definitely recommend spending a long afternoon here."

We paid $6 for parking. We went to the market and all the vendors were not there because it was the first day and it was raining. Not a lot of fruits and vegetables in season yet. There is a garden centre on the other side. There is a store that sells artwork, plants, crafts, honey, sauces. There’s a cafe in there and you can get a sandwich and coffee. They have lots of nature trails. We didn’t get to do it because it was raining. There is a dog park and bike trails. We actually got to see a beaver in a stream by the entrance. Apparently a 6 inch tooth of a prehistoric beaver was found on the property and you can see it on display in one of the buildings that also has the old machine used in the making of bricks The company was opened for over 100 years. Lots of history here. It’s a great place to visit on a nice day when you can go on the many nature trails."

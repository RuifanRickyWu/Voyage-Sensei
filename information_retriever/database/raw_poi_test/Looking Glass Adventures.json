        "Came here with a group of friends to do the Operation Flamingo escape room back in August 2021 and we all had a blast!  The escape rooms here are very family friendly and do not include any extra effects that may scare people.  The difficulty level is just right for people of all ages (but don’t come here thinking the escape room puzzles will be a cakewalk), and the puzzles offered are definitely solvable in the quoted amount of time you have to escape.  The hosts and staff are friendly and will be more than willing to give you a helping hand if needed.  They also seem to have a variety of other escape room themes and even a virtual option should you wish to have an escape room experience from the comfort of your home.  Definitely something I will consider if I’m in the mood to go do another escape room.  I’d highly recommend this place for anyone, both virtual and in person - I will definitely be back!"

We had a different host for Walden's, and he had some trouble managing the camera while performing the tasks needed to complete the puzzles.  ",

It was harder to see and hear some of  what was going on in Operation Flamingo, and some of its items had some damage---plastic spiders missing legs---that made one of the puzzles a challenge in a not good way.",

I didn’t catch the name of our avatar but he did a wonderful job, followed direction well and didn’t reveal anything without someone in our group drawing attention to it. He also spoke clear and to the point.   The game flowed well, not too easy but now impossible solve.  Some cool mechanisms to reveal clues and interesting story line.   Looking forward to doing another one when available.  I strongly recommend."

That said, we were both beginners and it did take us close to an hour to complete the entire room. The difficulty level was just right and it was a great gateway experience that got us excited to do more escape rooms.",
        "The rooms were created beautifully with a focus on storytelling and immersion. Everything in the room, from the props to the backgrounds were all handmade by local artists and the people at Daydream Adventures. Even the staff orienting us to the adventure was in character and very accommodating of our questions.",
        "Without spoiling anything, the puzzles were very creative and fun to solve and definitely needed some out of the box thinking. ",
        "We will definitely be coming back to try our hand at the Ice Cave next."

CNIB staff created tactile versions of pictorial elements and when possible items were brailed.

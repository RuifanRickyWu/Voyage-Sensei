Great place to spend a few hours and the sun was shining so sitting outside on their patio by the water was just lovely."

Lots of good spots along the waterfront to take the sun too. There are stretches of grass to sprawl out on, muskoka chairs to take the sun, and the odd picnic bench for a bite or a card game.  This is a happening, lively part of a vibrant city. Rent a canoe! Rent a paddleboard, go for a cycle.....take a walk, then have a bite to eat. Enjoy! "

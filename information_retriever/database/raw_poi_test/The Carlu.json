        "Attended an event here - was excited to see the Carlu after many years of it being on our list of places to see in Toronto.  As there were many attendees, I found that they put us in a room that wasn't suitable for the presentation - it was hard to hear the presenters, which was unfortunate.  After the presentation, we were ushered into the adjoining room - which was beautiful.  However, the set up for the buffet, which included both desserts and appetizers, didn't allow for optimum circulation and as a result there were long lineups for the food.   The appetizers were wonderful, but it was difficult for the wait staff to replace dishes that were empty because of the lineups... it would have been better had they had more than one table for food with such a large group - and the room could certainly hold more tables. As a venue for a special function, like a wedding, it would be wonderful..."

I love the history of this building, dating back to the 1930's when Eatons occupied the building and \"the 7th floor\" where the Carlu is located now and which was designed by Mrs. Eaton specifically to hold high society events.",
        "Eventually, after Eatons moved to the Eaton Center, the 7th floor was closed and remained dormant and unoccupied for over 25 years.  Thankfully, new owners took over and restored it to its original glory.  The architecture is magnificent and it's beauty shines through in every room.",
        "As far as the food is concerned, I've been to cocktail receptions and dinners here.  The food is over all quite good, although when I was there for our industry's gala event last weekend, I found the meal did not live up to its standards from the past events.",

If you are in need of a hotel stay while there, the Courtyard Marriott is across the street and the Eaton Chelsea a short walk away.

        "There were so much fanfare when The Carlu opened after an expensively restorative surgery. I was therefore quite gleeful when the wedding of my best friend's daughter was held there. It was a chance to see this hyped up event facility. My husband and I rode up in the special elevator in the College Park to the 7th floor. Voila! The Carlu is stunningly Art-Deco designed in 1930s/1940s style. It is simply impressive. However, that is. The underwhelming service was unforgiven as there were only a handful of servers servicing a wedding cocktail and dinner for 200 guests. The dinner was therefore served in an incredible snail pace. The food was nothing memorable to write or praise about. The service and the food were simply no match to this stunning surrounding. After dinner, the 200 guests were asked to join their first dance in the dance room. OMG! The 200 guests found ourselves jammed up against each other in a literally 4x4 room with standing rooms only. Dear Carlu, you have the beauty but unfortunately no brain!"

It's mainly used as an event venue for things such as the marketing awards or fashion shows. You can possibly get in during Doors Open although the lineups are long. One of the principals - Jeffry Roick - once designed/catered a dinner event I led at Bombardier in Montreal and it was quite unforgettable (metal rivetted plates, rack of lamb, cloud projections, etc.)."

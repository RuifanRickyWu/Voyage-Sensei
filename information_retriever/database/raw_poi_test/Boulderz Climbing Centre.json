  "description": "Etobicoke is a relaxed area along the Humber River. It's saturated with green spaces and conservatories, making it a premier destination for outdoor sports, hiking, and nature walks. Its abundance of parkland and lakes makes it a typical spot for fishing, picnicking, and camping out, especially in warmer months. The peaceful area is also enjoyed by families, who appreciate its boardwalks and sports facilities. Locals enjoy the variety of golfing and country club opportunities, which also provide lessons for golfers of any skill level.",

        "Avoid this business and Boulderz Junction if you can. While the employees of this gym are generally great, friendly and attentive, the owners of these two gyms are sadly ruthless and petty. The owners, manipulate and threaten their employees, as well as create a toxic work environment. They force employees to sign a non-compete clause and are vindictive and threaten to sue when leaving. Visit any number of other gyms in the area with far better people owning and contributing to the climbing community positively.",
        "Policies - In addition to the above, you'll find Boulderz policies more restrictive than other gyms. For example, if you purchase a 10 pass and you do not use all vouchers prior to moving or a situation change, you cannot transfer these to anyone else. Money grab. Same applies if you would like to use a punch pass for your son/daughter or a friend joining you. They design the system to increase the likelihood you will have unused credit/punches. More money in their pocket. If you climb here long enough you will surely have an unpleasant experience",
        "Cleanliness - This gym is filthy. In one day new boulder problems get trashed. The mats are vinyl and below the wall is consistently a layer of chalk, dust and rubber from the weeks activity. Staff have brought this to the attention of the owners consistently, yet nothing is done to either vacuum more or preferably have felt/dusk capturing mats like most gyms.",
        "Priorities - The decisions made are dumbfounding. Employee satisfaction is their last priority. Rather than considering their employees, providing a raise beyond minimum wage, Boulderz chooses to apply for a liquor license, purchase commercial grade kitchen equipment, hire a chef to make sandwiches, all in an effort to make more money from waiting parents while their children participate in youth programs.",
        "And good luck enjoying the new set each week. If you arrive after work you'll have to wait until the youth teams are done with them first.",
        "Lots of complaining on my part, but I've been at this facility for years. Setters are good (some great!) and the employees deserve to be treated fairly. It's really too bad, as this facility is quite good if managed well.",
        "Don't support greed - check out the other gyms in the area."

        "I’ve read many of the older reviews below and was surprised with a few of the negative ones regarding customer service and snobbiness. Perhaps I was lucky with the staff or perhaps they’ve managed to turn the place around since then, but my experience here has been nothing but positive. Here are my thoughts:",
        "- one of biggest halls in the TO area. I haven’t been to them all but I have been to TCA, True North, Basecamp and Oasis. While they all have their personalities Boulderz has the largest facility. This translates to plenty of challenges and maximum climbing time (not having to wait!)",
        "- kids corner for small, new kid climbers with a top off and slide back down. Great for keeping the little ones together (and away from the larger adult areas). This is a great way to build up to some of the longer climbs.",
        "-the largest bouldering selection of all the climbing halls I’ve been to! This is my personal highlight and main reason for coming here!",
        "- about 50m of horizontal routes on the second floor to practice footwork and technique. They also have a small wall section for making your own course",
        "- fitness section to stretch, do weights, pull ups, TRX, bands, etc",
        "- they have not one but two Treadwalls! No belay needed and you can climb for as long as you can endure! One tread wall has an adjustable slope from positive to vertical and the speed of the wall can be adjust. The other wall is a negative slope. What a great way to build endurance.",
        "- about 10 different hangboards for workouts",
        "- vertical hang wall with slopers and edges for dyno and upper body, climbing grip workouts",
        "- plenty of walls with self-belay systems",
        "- a selection of routes with timers for those interested in speed climbing on using a self-belayer",
        "- I definitely liked the spaciousness of the hall. It felt open and large, with plenty of space to move around, sit, watch. ",
        "- They also have very nice private change rooms, washroom for feet, legs and hands. And they also have a place sit and get snacks and drinks.",
        "- They provide a good intro and safety briefing when visiting for the first time. We didn’t need to take any belay courses since we already are experienced but they do require you to be “tested/observed” before they allow you to climb with a belay. Otherwise you can start right away on the boulders or self-belay walls.",
        "Overall, if I were to choose which gym to spend a day, it would be here - without a doubt. I came here on my own yesterday and came back again with my family including two young kids (9 and 7) and loved it. The staff were friendly and helpful (much improved compared to some of the earlier reviews!) And although the other climbing halls have their own strengths and offer different things and are much closer to where I am (Scarborough) if I had to pick one gym to spend a day, it would be this place.",

They walked around like security guards (no smiles, all business).  I went up to the rental section to try to ask a question about where we could/couldn't have snacks and there were 4 staff standing behind the counter, all of them made eye contact with me and not one of them came forward to help me.  Very bizarre.  ",

My only complaint was the guy who did our orientation really was not helpful at all and sucked at his job-- gave us as little info or help as needed. I was TERRIFIED going up the first time and belaying back down and he did nothing to appease my fear or motivate me. Almost ruined the experience for me. However, my partner was extremely supportive and she made the night for me so much better, she should work there ;) by the end of it we were both pros... but no thanks to that guy lol...",

The kids could boulder, auto belay and belay if they wished. There was also a treadwall, like a vertical treadmill but for climbing, which the kids really liked. The staff were very friendly and competent when running through the facilities available. You could buy drinks and snacks at the front desk. The prices were excellent and the twins could spend as much time climbing around as they wished. Harness, shoes and chalk were all included in the price. It was only around $42 for the pair of them. Excellent experience!"

        "Overall: Snobby staff, unwelcoming to newbies (or climbers who need a refresher). ",
        "Went tonight with a coworker who has been here a few times. Though I've been climbing a few times at different gyms around the GTA, it had been over a year since I had hit the walls. I figured I would get an intro lesson and a few pointers when I arrived, and no problem, it would come back to me and we would be able to climb the rest of the evening. I was wrong. They do not offer any sort of intro classes on Sundays, only on 3 days of the week at very specific times. Not only that, but they were unable to give me pointers to guide me in the right direction. Ontop of that, they were snobby and made me feel unwelcomed as a beginner. Anything that you haven't done in over a year would take some time to get back into it, especially something as technical as belaying. I'm fairly sure the guy who did my belay test was out to fail me from the get go. It was his attitude and lack of compassion, and when he failed me, he said if in a way that was quite unfriendly. I'm sure there's no good way to tell someone they failed a test but I could have thought of 10 different ways he could have said it that would have made me feel better. He made it very clear also that I would in no way be able to try again today. I should have done more research before coming here and known that intro classes weren't offered tonight. I only assumed that like many other gyms in the city, I would be able to pay for an demo. Felt ripped off after paying close to $30 for a day pass, shoe & harness rental and not be able to climb & not being given a chance to. Also, they must not have air conditioning because the place was way too hot and stuffy. It was at least 10 *C cooler outside. My friend and I ended up bouldering for a bit. Overall this place left a really bad taste in my mouth."

        "The basic setup is about half bouldering (stand alone, no real equipment but shoes and maybe hand chalk needed) and half rope climbing. Because I went with many kids, it was great that they have a series of pully systems you hook into that let you down easy when you're ready to descend. They're good for speed training too, and I apologize for forgetting the name of the system – I've only been to Boulderz twice. Sadly, there are only about six or seven in the whole place, so they can be popular. ",
        "If you're into roped climbs, there are dozens and dozens and dozens of them – probably 100 or more. There's even a high arch for those adventurous types. ",
        "There is also an isolated area for beginners and kids. That's what's nice about this place. The crowd is a blend of families, rookies and the extremely experienced, which can be pretty interesting to watch. ",
        "By the time we left I had pretty well sanded off my finger prints and was waiting for two mitts of blisters the next which never came. It goes without saying that climbing is fantastic exercise, and compared to other rock wall gyms I've heard of, Boulderz would be the best. There is a second smaller location on Dufferin Street in the Junction area of Toronto, but we haven't been and probably wouldn't go because we've heard it's quite a bit smaller. ",
        "The only problem I'd point out is that the staff can be a little slow to react (to booking new people in, getting you equipped, making sure you're comfortable and trained). All that aside, I'd recommend this place and will return in the future."

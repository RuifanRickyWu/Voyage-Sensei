The acoustics are some of the best I have ever experienced.  I was here for a Royal Conservatory Orchestra concert and I was wowed by the sheer talent the student orchestra produces.  There is no bad seat in the house, even if you are seated high up.",

Unfortunately the Dover Quartet was prevented from playing because of a Covid issue, but the New Orford Quartet was able to step in at short notice and played a Mendelssohn Quartet. The young US baritone Davone Tines made an excellent impression during the second half of the concert, though his program had to be changed at short notice. This is the first live music we've heard since the Pacfic Baroque Festival in Victoria more than 18 months ago. A happy new beginning!"

Once again we were impressed by the splendid acoustics of the place, as well as the excellent sight lines, particularly from the parterre seats. What a wonderful addition to the Toronto musical scene Koerner Hall has proved to be! Visitors to Toronto, as well as Torontonians themselves, absolutely must attend a performance there."

The lounge areas on each floor are comfortable and with great views of the park below.  Washrooms have lots of stalls too and that reduces lineups.  Seating is comfortable but not much leg room.  There are seats along the side and back of the stage but center seating is best.  As the sound is magnified, people who cough or rustle paper can be heard so the audience is warned in the program to be quiet and they are for the most part.  Great for instrumental or vocal music.  One of the best concert halls for sound in Toronto."

We were a little disappointed when we walked in and told the staff that it was pretty warm and they didn't seemed overly concerned or planned to do anything about it.  They could have been more sensitive on their response and say they'd look into it.  As I said the acoustics are very good but it would have helped if the folks (Mayfair?) had done a better live mix to maximize the high quality house PA.  Alex's guests that night included his dad on guitar/vocals, a pianist, 3 great horn players along with Steve Cuddy.  The horns were not brought to the volume deserved or appropriate which was quite disappointing.  In fact the guests pianist who was also VERY good, (quite strangely) sounded more like a synthesizer to steel-drum at times. Maybe not Koerner's fault."

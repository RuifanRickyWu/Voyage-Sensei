Unfortunately, the City of Toronto has no vision for this area and it drifts along. If they but could find the bandwidth to make some investments in some great landscaping, extend the boardwalk in both directions and rip down that idiotic mini stadium, it'd be a good start. Unfortunately, it'll be 20 years before they wake up and have a look at the best open and FREE recreational area in Toronto. Honestly, at times in the summer, it's nicer than Maui. But yet, they seem to think it's the Burlington roller rink."

Not the greatest for families.  If you are looking for a beach party - this is the spot. Otherwise head east along the boardwalk for the more tame, family friendly spots.  Bring your own food as it is quite expensive at the restaurant or the Pizza Pizza vendors.  If you are driving be sure to either park in the Green P lots just west of the beach (however these fill up quickly) or just North of the Park by the Beaches theatre (just south of Queen Street).  DO NOT park in the lots right at the entrance to the beach (near the restaurant as it costs $20 while there are much cheaper options right around the area."

It's a park in the east end of Toronto that affords the opportunity of walking by the lake and being able to see the city from a distance.  It's a good walk no matter what the season.  If you take a picnic with you there are lots of picnic benches to sit at and some are right next to the water. To get there you'd take the Queen Street car east to the Coxwell stop and then walk south to the entrance of the park.  You have to cross Lakeshore Road.  It's about a 10 minute walk from the streetcar stop.  There is a public  washroom there and a very wide beach.  In the summer Ashbridges Beach i where the volleyball competitions take place."

All of the beach volleyball courts were taken and the people were not willing to share. The community center that is a walk away from the beach with a swimming pool was closed for the summer-which was a big let down for us as we didn't see that information anywhere online. People were actually standing outside the doors and bickering about how absurd this is. The trip was a waste of time and body fluids really...Really nice nature around the beach and in the park, though. You can enjoy live music (some of which may be ethnic) performances on your walk from the parking lot to the beach/park."

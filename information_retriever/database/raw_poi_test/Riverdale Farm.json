        "My disappointment comes from my interaction with the staff at the entrance. Before we entered, I asked the two women sitting there if there were benches along the path. I knew my mom would need to take a couple of breaks (knee issues). They didn't know! Seriously! They work there, but they don't know? Have they never walked through even once? One of them proceeded to tell me that *if* there were any benches, they would likely be taped off and we couldn't use them. They also informed us (in not too nice of a tone) that the path was one way only and that once we entered, the only way out was to complete the path.",
        "Anyway, for the record, there are lots of benches (not taped off) -- and lots of low stone walls, also suitable for taking a quick break. As the exit is in a different place than the entrance, I didn't see them again -- otherwise I would have educated them about THEIR job."

There are cows, horses, sheep, goats, pigs and chickens. I think I'm missing other animals. I stayed for the animal presentation at 11:30 a.m., which was about the cows. The place is lovely. It's a good place for kids and adults alike. Easy to go there using public transportation. The admission is free, but you can donate what you want to support the farm. Recommended!"

My kids are way older now but I still love coming here with my husband just to get out for the day. Amazing and cute animals.  Can be educational for younf ones.

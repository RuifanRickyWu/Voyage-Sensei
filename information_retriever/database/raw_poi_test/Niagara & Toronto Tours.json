        "This tour guide attracts people from all over the world, and I had just as much fun learning about them and their country as I did seeing the falls. The trip itself is beautiful and our tour guide was knowledgeable and helpful. My phone was low battery at the falls and I had to turn it off which resulted in me losing track of time having so much fun. Luckily i turned my phone on just in time for him to call me and get me back to our meeting spot only 5 mins late. He then charged my phone for me so i wouldn’t get stranded in downtown toronto - truly great service! Thank you for being a part of my trip to toronto and niagara falls!"

Although we had visited Niagara before, this trip gave us slightly different experiences to enjoy ( the river at Niagara on the Lake and the Whirlpool) which was good. He also signposted the deli in the visitor centre at the Falls which had a much better selection and was much better value."

Instead we took a long arduous coach trip. Stopping at totally irrelevant stops. IE: a 45 min stop in a horrible maple syrup tasting place that had cafes which were like a truck stop. Terrible food. I’m guessing the company had commissions with this place. A lot of hanging around. The traffic getting back into Toronto city at 6.30 was dreadful planning an we crawled along which took two hours. Never again will I take an organised tour. Do it independently it’s way quicker and much less hanging around. We used Kings tours through Viator. Please don’t bother. Not worth the time money or exhaustion."

        "Unfortunately we had our tour on the same day as the marathon. This made getting to the pick up point difficult. So our tour guide, Michael, called us at the pick up time asking where we were. He cussed at us, told us our Lyft driver was the worst ever (he was working his butt off with unexpected road closures), told us 100 people were waiting on us (it was 22), cussed at us again, and hung up with a “we leave at 8:20” warning. We got there by 8:20, having gotten out of the Lyft and run the last 4 blocks through closed roads, and the guide video recorded us running up to the bus as he was laughing at us! We weren’t even the only ones running behind due to the traffic. He then proceeded to have sexual jokes, rude jokes, make very direct requests to go to the ATM to get him a tip, and overall was not humorous or interesting. And the constant honking… wow. For no reason. The kicker, at the end when getting off the bus I said thank you but didn’t offer him a tip and he said “I waited for you and you won’t leave one?” And I just walked away. Ridiculous. I would fire people like that if they worked for me doing customer service. Awful treatment of his passengers. I do not recommend."

The Falls themselves are stunning, and the town of Niagara on the Lake is super cute with lots of shops for all your Falls themes trinkets. If you’re looking to go from Toronto to Niagara Falls, we would definitely recommend the fastest and funniest tour out there!"

The tour stops at Niagara on the Lake for about an hour as well at Niagara Gorge & Mighty Whirlpool Rapids for a photo stop before arriving at the falls.  We had about 3 hours to take the Hornblower trip, eat lunch and walk down to see horseshoe falls, which is just about right for those activities.  Only downside is there isn't time to go to the butterfly conservatory as it is not near the falls."

  "description": "Established in 1878, this is one of Toronto’s oldest neighborhoods and the largest Chinatown in North America. Here, you can find colorful storefronts, bustling streets, and a variety of restaurants and specialty shops. Visit the quaint teahouses and intriguing herbal stores, as well as browse the clothing stores. When hungry, pop by the steaming noodle houses for some wonton soup, hunt for the famous Peking duck, or go on a dumpling crawl. At night, Chinatown lights up in bright neon red, with lanterns lining the alleys and Chinese music blaring from the karaoke bars. Combine your visit here with a trip to Little Italy and Kensington Market—both within walking distance. – Tripadvisor",

However, this time around August 2023, I came to Chinatown in Toronto and to my surprise and sadness, the Chinatown looked rundown and the atmosphere there seemed to be Not lively and busy anymore.  I talked to my relative living in Toronto and she said more shops and restaurants moved out of Toronto chinatown."

Like walking around in a Metrocolor film from the 70s. I went 3 nights in a row with my friend and found something different to eat each night.

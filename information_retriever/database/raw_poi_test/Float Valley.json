  "description": "Float Valley is a sensory deprivation/floatation center located in Markham, ON across from Markville Mall. We have 6 floatation cabins each filled with 10 inches of temperature neutral Epsom saltwater allowing you to float effortlessly. The cabin blocks out light and sound allowing you to relax on a very deep level. Floating is great for athletes, pain relief, creativity and mental health!",

Calming from stillness is my moksha, expansion of my quads to unbind from femoral artery, and decompression of my spine all leads to an excellent experience as a compass needle in a chill space with violet flame fireplace."

As a first time floater, everything was explained to me in detail to make sure I was comfortable and informed. Floating gave my mind a complete sense of calm and awareness I didn't know I was capable of whilst awake and unoccupied and I immediately felt the benefits of it in my work and personal life afterwards. What an INCREDIBLE experience, thank you Float Valley!! This has definitely become a part of my self-care toolkit and I will definitely be back again very soon."

It has Netflix inside and the option to connect your own music. Very different than the traditional sauna in the way you detox and sweat also causing you to lose 600 calories in 30 mins. If you haven't heard of floating before I encourage you to check out their website : floatvalley.com and go try a session. Floating is great for pain relief, meditation and relaxation."

Float Valley is beautiful. The staff is very friendly and knowledgeable. They make the environment very relaxing and comfortable. They also keep everything super sparkly clean which is a major plus. I would definitely recommend trying Float Valley if your in town for some mind and body relaxation, therapeutic energies and healing."

        "\"My wife and I just finished our float session. This was her first, and my second. We had an incredible experience. The staff were friendly and the facility is clean, inviting, and calming. For those floating for the first time, it can be a bit of an adjustment. For me, it was like an hour of forced meditation, in a sensory-free environment. And the feeling of weightlessness was rejuvenating for my joints and muscles. We live in a sensory-rich environment. Investing this one hour was life-giving for the body, mind, heart and spirit. I highly recommend Float Valley to anyone looking to temporarily escape the stresses of the modern world.\" ",

It was my first float, and though i was a bit rushed and stressed in the getting there, once I walked in I immediately began to relax.  I was welcomed by the owner, who has such a serene energy.  The place itself is beautiful and calming.  ",

I had never tried floating before and I really appreciated how their website answers all questions and concerns + more with their detailed FAQs. In additions, the owner, Nadeem is extremely knowledgeable and willing to answer any questions. ",
        "The first time I experienced floating, I went with my best friend and we tried to Ocean Cabin (recommended for first time floaters). Really spacious, love how there is an option to control the lights inside, and I felt safe the entire time. After our experience, we freshened up and blowdryed our hair in the vanity area, and then proceeded to check out the lounge space and enjoyed tea, water, and colouring after.",
        "The second time I went, I tried the Oasis Pod and I would say I prefer this! Much smaller and there are no lights but because it is dark right away, it was easier for me to get in the zone. It is more cozy and intimate and is said to simulate our experience of being in the womb. Floating in 800lbs of Epsom Salts is a unique experience and every time I go, I can never tell if my eyes are open or closed. Sensory deprivation is neat. ",
        "Honestly I think floating is worth trying at least twice. The first time you’re getting used to the feeling and then because you know what to expect, the second time is a lot more comfortable and in depth! ",
        "Oh! Something I love is the scent of their shampoo & conditioner in the showers after! Good quality stuff! ",
        "Be sure to try the Kava drink (helps you relax!) at least once! I tried it with my sister another time when I went and although there was a bit of a bitter aftertaste, we were so zen for the rest of the day. ",
        "I appreciate how the owner, Nadeem is always willing to learn more about the Float Industry. He attended a Float conference in Portland just last month it just shows how much he cares and is willing to learn from others in the field. Float Valley cares about making your experience enjoyable and I’m glad he has brought it to Markham. I’m excited to go again this week!"

I’ve been to a few different locations now, and spent dozens of hours in tanks. Would have to say without a doubt Float Valley is the best place to be if your serious about floating, or just dipping your toes in for the first time. Operated by someone who truly cares, great staff. 10/10."

The float experience itself is amazing, with all the showers and amenities carefully laid out to be as convenient as possible. Highly recommend checking out if you want to go float yourself!"

I tried floating in the Oasis tank this time around and I still had more than enough room at 6'6\". I could have been a foot taller and a foot wider and still had lots of room to float. From the minute you enter the doors at Float Valley, this is the most relaxing experience I've had in a very long time."

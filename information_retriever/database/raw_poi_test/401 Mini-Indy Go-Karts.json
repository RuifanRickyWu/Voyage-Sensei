It's saturated with green spaces and conservatories, making it a premier destination for outdoor sports, hiking, and nature walks. Its abundance of parkland and lakes makes it a typical spot for fishing, picnicking, and camping out, especially in warmer months. The peaceful area is also enjoyed by families, who appreciate its boardwalks and sports facilities. Locals enjoy the variety of golfing and country club opportunities, which also provide lessons for golfers of any skill level.",

The tortoise Albert on display had more personality that the two chicks working at the ticket counter.  Suggest skip this place."

        "We bought this from Groupon at $30. It includes 10 laps of Go Karts and 18 holes of glow in the dark golf. When we got there we had to create and account on the tablets along the counter and sign the waiver. This took time because the one tablet was sticking and I had to do it 3 times. The tablet on the very left works but the one beside it was giving a problem. However the employee who works there was very friendly and talked us through it. We then went out and picked out our helmets. Take off your glasses first (if you wear them) before putting on a helmet. The older gentleman told us about the rules and gave us our cars. The go karts had to be the smoothest go karts I’ve ever been on and the breaks worked very well. Just like a car. When we reached 9 laps the gentleman came out and waved a flag to let us know. There is also a junior go kart track for the little guys. After the go karts we went and got our golf clubs, balls and score card with pencil. I loved the glow in the dark and the race car theme. The course was fun. If you want to play another game then you hand in the card and get the next game for $7 each. We spent about 1 hour and a half here. We went on a Wednesday around 12:15 and there was only 2 other people ahead of us. It made for an enjoyable time not having anyone around. You get a membership card that’s good for 2 years. And it gets you $$ off your next visit. Also cannonball war games where you play in 2 teams and shoot balls into the other teams net and whoever gets the most balls wins. On Stoffel Drive make sure you go to the end of the road and turn right. The front of the building faces the highway. Lots of parking. This was a fun experience. "

The supervisor stated they changed their policy and required a deposit to which I most definitely was not informed. I just had another party there 4 months ago so why would I assume the policy changed? I was still able to take the kids for the go carting alone and charged the party price deal. ",
        "However, they charged me one extra person; didn’t get the bday boy trophy which is included in the deal; was delayed by 45 mins due to a backlog of registrations; didn’t get their membership cards for next time; and had to text all the parents to pick up their kids one hour later due to the delays. I will not recommend this venue to anyone. Will be taking my business elsewhere where good customer service is valued."

The karting is not very organized with the family and 'experienced' groups being separated without signage. The track is smallish and passing is difficult unless the driver in front makes a poor driving line. Gas engines make for a smelly experience. The experience took way longer than expected, so make time. Don't think I'll need to return, but our family had a good time."

        "We went to 401 Mini Indy on a very cold day in February. It was fairly easy to find the location, upon arriving it looks a little run down in a very large grey warehouse. There is not really any signage indicating which way to go but we walked in (apparently from the back entrance) and had to walk to the front alongside the go kart track to get to the front to buy tickets for go karting. Initially there was a 45 minute wait for the go karts so we went mini golfing which was housed at the same location. We had fun doing a quick put through the glow in the dark scenery. The location was extremely filled with children so if your looking for a peaceful mini putting experience this may not be for you. Anyways the wait for go karting was very long and filled with fumes and cold air. Make sure to dress warm and if you are asthmatic then forget this! go on a warmer day so they have the doors open and its better ventilated because otherwise your lungs will be fried for days!"

After just 10 laps my arms were ready to fall off but we kept going for another 5. I don't think I would go for more than 15 laps without a break.",

I was using a Groupon but wanted to purchase additional laps so she listened to what I was trying to get and then told me of a less expensive option that would give us the same amount of track time.

Suddenly they knew exactly who are reservation was with... What a surprise! We then had the pleasure of waiting exactly 2 hours to go-cart when we were told one hour max. We also got to watch people who only just walked in get to go ahead of us. All the staff are supposed to be watching the cars, instead they're playing on their phones. 2 groups of kids (not ours) kept getting stuck and the parents continually had to let the staff know because the employees were either talking to each other or on their phones.

I wish they had more of double seater kars available only 3. I had few kids that could only go on doubles and took a while. It was a Sunday early afternoon place wasn't busy which it was a bonus! Staff was very helpful,  nice kids working there. The girl at the desk was very nice and knew what she was talking about.  The guys at the kars were great too. Made sure my bunch of kids were taking care of. Thanx Guys!! I recommend this place for smaller parties just because If you end up during busy hours ....it's a wait . I had just over 20 kids and it wasn't too busy. Lucky me! Place could be cleaner though around the party area. Right after the go karts kids did the glow in the dark golfing that was fun too. I definitely recommend this place. And my boys so want to go back. 🚘"

We didn't experience to much of the bumping and recklessness that the yelp reviews talk about. They time your laps and give you a print out after which is nice. After the go karting we did the mini golf. There were several staff that came and and started putting on our hole before we were even done it. They were also yelling around.

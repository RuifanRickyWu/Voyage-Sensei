The sound quality on the first floor was excellent, even under the balcony, and the standing-room setup worked well. A thoughtful touch was the staff making accommodations for people with disabilities by providing chairs.",
        "Some areas of the venue are less accessible, like the bathrooms in the basement, which are reached via narrow staircases and tight hallways that can’t always fit two people side by side. The bathroom attendant handing out soap and towels for tips felt unnecessary. ",
        "On a positive note, getting in and out of the building was very smooth, even with coat check. ",
        "One area that could be improved: the show I attended started almost an hour late, and there were no announcements explaining the delay. Many people in line were confused and unsure of what was happening. A little communication would go a long way!"

Granted, you won't catch bigger bands but there is enough talent that graces this stage.  Not the class of let's say a Roy Thomson Hall, but nonetheless worthy of going there whenever a band I like happens to gig there.  But don't let the moniker fool you, there is no opera in this house."

        "Horrible horrible horrible. First of all、all sling bags that were purchased by fans that included concert goodies weren't allowed into the venue. Bap had been to 8 locations prior to this stop and not a single venue had a problem with fans bringing in their purchased goodie bags. We were told at the entrance to either bring our bags to our car/hotel or have them hang it up for $4. So the scheduled soundcheck started over half an hour late because most of the fans had to lineup again in another line to pay and put their bags away because alot of us were from out of the area. Now the concert came and went、fans just started lining up for group photos. Staff came around and told us we need to go retrieve our items because the lady was going home、her shifts over. What the f? If it's not allowed、it's not allowed. All of a sudden everyone is allowed to pick it up and go back into the venue because the staff needs to go home cause she can't sit another hour after counting all the money the venue just scammed every attendee. Call me petty for even writing this over $4、but that's not the problem. The problem is、if they allowed the bags in at the end、they should've just allowed it at the beginning. This wasted so much time starting the soundcheck and made photo session ending much much later because everyone was scurrying in line both times trying to hang their stuff up and getting their items back. Also caused the group to end their night later after they've been working so hard on this tour. They made good money. Good job scammers."

This place looks like it's going to cave in any point. There are wires and hooks hanging from the ceiling, and it looks like there used to be a chandelier in the middle of the ceiling that was removed and they never patched up the roof after taking it down.",

        "The only issue is that after the concert was over, there was ZERO organization. There is only 1 stairwell to leave from, and the staff basically forced everyone from the concert hall right after the show ended to start sweeping. With only 1 door open for patrons to leave from, there was a huge back log on the stairs, with people lining both sides with the railings (they were heading up to get their coats) and the only opening was the middle of the stairs to come down on. With the uneven stairs and no handrail to hold on to it was crazy to try to get down the stairs. ",
        "With the fog machines from the stage and amount of people that were in the building, there was little fresh air, they need to get a fan going or at least figure out a new ventilation system. ",
        "It was a great venue to be able to see the artist up close, but due to the poor conditions of the building and lack or organization, I doubt I would go back to see another performance here."

We got in about 15 minutes after the doors opened and went right to the bar.  The lovely bartender overheard our conversation and told us to check out the balcony.  We ended up sitting on the 2nd tier dead center at these nice cocktail tables.  Awesome. And the show was damn good too.  I will come back here again , cool neighbourhood  , friendly people and great sound in an old hall."

He showed her his medical card, and I told her I would dispose of it and come back in without it, but she decided to rip it from my hand, and throw it in the garbage. She then told everyone around that I scratched her!! She seemed to be on a real power trip and appeared to be unstable. The whole thing completely ruined the Sun Kil Moon concert and was completely ridiculous. THEN to top it all off, my husband and I got separated, so he went outside the front door to see if I was there, forgetting that I had the tickets, and even though the lady saw him leave and he told her he was looking for me, she wouldn't let him back in b/c he didn't have his ticket.

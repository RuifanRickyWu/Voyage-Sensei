        "Attended the Toronto International Festival of Authors.  Total cost of a single ticket was $39.99 plus taxes came to $45.19 total.  The tickets did not get sent to my email.  Phoned twice for it and waited 1/2 hour in total and on arrival had to go to customer service to get it printed.  So I missed the only speaking event I wanted to attend.  Did not realize the book signing event, though listed as a free event, required registration.  It was of course full.  So waited in a \"rush line\" (no guarantee of entrance) for over an hour which security dispersed.   Only to see the author being hurried away down a hallway without even a glance at his waiting fans (only about 20 of us).  A friendly hello wave and/or a few words would have made all the difference in the world.  Security was utterly overbearing what did they think we were going to do to this author?  Nothing, what a complete waste of time and money and we all were left feeling really disappointed, sad and I personally felt at the end of the day, badly treated.  Thanks to the Internatinal Festival of Authors, for wasting my valuable time and hard- earned dollars and making me feel like trash."

        "During pandemic things have changed at Harbourfront Centre, where families can normally enjoy public art and activities like canoeing or skating year round. We’ve ridden bikes and picked up food at Loblaws supermarket on Queens Quay before (where cash payment for car-parking is an option). Instead, a shop or two was open along Harbourfront, and the Centre generally remained closed, except its public washrooms on SW exterior. We bought takeout lunch across Queens Quay and could eat on the benches, along with churros from nearby food trucks. Kids can get photos taken above the washroom level, where a colourful outdoor mural is painted. Bicyclists and tourists travelling by TTC streetcars from Union Subway station could relax on the green lawn and patio, overlooking the boardwalk and water. Ferries were running nearby from Westin to Toronto /Centre Island, and people wore masks to stay socially distanced and safe. I plan to return by mid October when leaves are turning colour to catch the scenery of Toronto’s island."

There was traffic and noise everywhere and very lttle views of the lake, Shame on you, Toronto City Council for ont valuing the heritage and beauty of your city!"

It always has different events to feature multicultural city. Due to the COVID-19, many facilities are still closed, but we still find things to do here. We had a nice dinner at Amsterdam restaurant. After the dinner, we walked on the boardwalk and enjoyed the breeze, watching the street artists performances. We feel like a staycation without spending too much money. We finished the night with the Beveartails pastry and ice cream 🍦😋 (must try dessert) . It made a perfect ending for us. Totally recommend for couples, families and who enjoy the night life. If you're on a budget, it's perfectly fine to bring your food and have a picnic here. All you need is a peaceful mind enjoy your surroundings.  Have a happy summer to everyone 😊!

        "Purchased a package of classes in 2011 but no where is it listed that the classes expire. Due to personal reasons I was unable to use the entire package before now so when I inquired about reusing my remaining package, I was informed the classes expired. I had specifically purchased the package because one of the selling points was that there was no expiry date. I then asked Jonathan to point to the location (website, brochure) where clients are notified of expiry date (June 16, 2016) or emails where he might have informed me and he could not point to it. Jonathan claims this was in the account but for some reason when I asked if I could access my account, he indicated the Account History was erased. Other than offering a complimentary class, I find this quite disappointing and poor business practice to a) not advertise that packages are valid for a certain period b) to erase any profiles/history especially as I had attended a class within the last 12 months. Buyer beware!"

        "I bought one of the new students' specials, which is always a big plus since it allows you to try out various classes and teachers without it being hard on your wallet. The space is cozy and intimate, but not packed. I felt I was getting all the needed attention and adjustments from the instructors, with more than enough space to move around. I mention this bc I have practiced in studios where you severely restrict your motion from how closely packed the mats are.  This is exactly what I needed at this time to compliment my home practice. The instructors are knowledgable and figure out ways to appropriately challenge you, and the studio offers workshops with ashtanga masters. Glad this place is around the corner from my work!"

        "Great classes with Amanda before she suddenly left. Then I was disappointed that the teachers weren't consistent. But along came Rachael and all is fantastic in the studio again. I love her style because she isn't rigid. Rachael figures out what boundaries we can push and her style is right up my alley. I feel peace with the way she teaches, and that is what yoga is about. ",
        "What would be helpful is that if teachers leave, it should be communicated. I know a lot of us get attached and we are always surprised to see new teachers. Once there is a 2 way street among Fireflow and students, then I think acceptance of a new teacher would be more receptive for us. ",
        "Other than that, I absolutely adore this studio. I never liked yoga until I started coming here. Huge difference in my perception. Thanks!!!"

        "We've been doing private ashtanga classes with Jonathan at Fireflow for almost one year. I'm 41 and my partner is 51. Prior to these classes, I had been practicing yoga sporadically for approximately 10 years. However, my partner had never practiced. We now attend twice a week for 60-75 minute sessions, and unlike other physical activity, we really look forward to our practice. The physical and mental benefits for both of us have been remarkable. The classes are always challenging and extremely rewarding, and the one on one allows for a more intense and fulfilling practice. Jonathan is a knowledgeable and dedicated teacher whose passion for yoga is an inspiration. We look forward to our continued practice..."

        "I have been going to Fireflow for just over a year now and absolutely love the place and the teachers!  The atmosphere is very friendly and welcoming.  I have not experienced this at several other studios I have tried out in the past.  The teachers are all awesome and very knowledgeable.  I personally like the hands-on corrections and being pushed to try something new to further my yoga practice.  Classes at Fireflow have become part of my training program and complements it very well.  I get a great workout both mentally and physically.  It also helps me unwind and de-stresses me after a tough day at work.  I highly recommend practicing at this studio!  The location is great too!"

        "I originally started doing yoga because my chiropractor recommended it to me. After much searching for a good yoga studio on the internet, I came upon Fireflow Yoga. I have now been going to Fireflow for the past 8 months and I have to say that I am extremely happy with it. The teachers each bring their own unique experience to the class and are always helping you improve your practice. So far I have taken the beginners, ashtanga flow, and ying/yang classes and I think they’re all great. I now feel stronger, healthier and more aligned. If you’re searching for a yoga studio, I definitely recommend Fireflow =D"

I've been practicing at this studio for almost a year now and have enjoyed every class. I've tried a variety of classes - beginners, restorative, ashtanga flow and ying/yang. The teachers are all super knowledgeable, inspired and passionate. This studio really does have a class suited for everyone. Originally, I was a yoga skeptic but the teachers at Fireflow have made me a believer! Highly recommend this studio :)"

The teachers are so amazing and the classes are very challenging.  i am a long distance runner and find like to come to class after a good run.  It really helps to stretch out all of muscles and make sure I don't get injured.   All of the teachers are really great and have so much to offer.   I like the Ashtanga style of yoga they offer as it also offers a really good workout. I like that they often",

        "I cannot comment on the yoga class as I did not attend, however I can comment on the rude service that I received upon arriving at the studio. my friend and I had purchased a passport to prana pass a while back, it so happens that Fireflow Yoga is located very close to my house. I was in a hunt for a regular yoga studio and i was hoping that Fireflow was a great place to sign up....WRONG. I had forgotten my card that day, thinking it would not be an issue as I had done this once before in another studio i printed out my information and card # online.  Upon arriving, i had explained to the gentleman with the shaved head (i believe he's the owner) that i had forgotten my card but i have all the information he needs in order for me to attend the class. Long story short, he was very rude, cold and definitely not welcoming. He had told me that he cannot accept what i have as he needs the actual card. Anyhow, my friend was already in the class waiting for me. I told her that he will not let me in so she left the class and we both excited the studio. We definitely did NOT feel welcomed at all and he did not want our business. If you are looking for a relaxing, friendly studio, sorry this is not the studio for you! I strongly recommend 889, i will be singing up with them."

All of the yoga teachers clearly love what they do, and love sharing their knowledge with beginners and experienced yogis alike. I have taken several yoga classes and workshops in various places over many years, and have found that Fireflow yoga ticks all the right boxes: professional, clean, knowledgeable, flexible and helpful."

I would say the only change would be to eliminate the Golden Patty part of the tour - at least give a taste of something other than the beef patty in coco bread.  Wasn‚Äôt a fan, and I sensed others felt the same.   The portions overall were a lot more than I was expecting.. I would say I was closer to almost 1.5 meals worth of food... so come a little hungry.  Otherwise, this tour is highly recommended."

She was very attentive and personable, she had lots of interesting facts about the history of the area and despite being a local, and having visited the market many times, she showed us areas we had never noticed. The food was very good, and filling. We started out with a smoked meat poutine, meat and cheese empanadas, Jamaican patties in coco bread, interesting sushi wrapped in a tofu pocket, Tibetan salty butter tea & dumplings and Swedish iced tea with ginger cookies.  I'd gladly recommend this as a good activity for anyone visiting the city, or locals who wanted to sample what different places offer, without committing to an entire serving of something you have never tried. It really showcases, the many ethnicities that make our city home."

        "This tour was incredible on many fronts!  The e bikes make it easy to enjoy the sights and sounds of toronto.  The bikes are so comfortable and simple to ride and you can use them with little or no pedalling or full peddling, if you wish.  Adam was extremely knowledgable, pleasant and entertaining! My husband planned this for a birthday surprise and we managed to see a number of sites across the city within our tour.  Adam suggested poses and took many memorable photos of us each site that we will treasure!  The pace was set by us, and we enjoyed each site and had the time to fully take it in.  The amazing thing about this tour is you can go with a standard tour of set locations or you can choose from",

We were very happy with the bikes as they allow you to pedal at your desired pace. The power assist adds a fun dimensions to the ride and we covered a fair bit of ground. This is a fun way to explore downtown Toronto and take it all in. We were extremely satisfied with every aspect of our tour and highly recommend you try it!!! 2 thumbs up. "

We went over the far side of the harbour to get some great skyline views, and then went through the harbourfront, distillery, university and shopping areas and everywhere in between. ",
        "Adam set a good pace but was keeping an eye on us, and he is very assertive with the traffic - which was needed in a good few cases. He stopped frequently to chat and give us information, and also to take more photos than I've had on any day since my wedding day. ",

Toronto is becoming very bike-friendly (at least in summer!) and riding an ebike allows you to cover a lot of ground without working up too much of a sweat.  Being out in the open air, really feeling the different environments of Toronto while being guided by a true local makes for a memorable experience. Also, Adam took great pictures for us at all the stops and quickly sent them via email.",

Although I commute to work via bike, I was a little nervous about how an eBike would function- but it's incredibly easy and super fun! Adam was a great tour guide - he was knowledgeable, friendly, had many insights into the city's history and showed us around some neighborhoods that we never would have found on our own. He also took photos throughout the tour and shared them with us which was a really nice touch. I highly recommend it!"

        "Adam showed up few minutes later and greeted us. He called his assistant who was upstair in a messy appartment which was used as their office. It was full on stuff and boxes all over the place. I had to follow his assistant uptstairs to pay, and the only way I could pay was by going on their website and filling the online form and paying through paypal.. They don't have the direct payment machine.",

        "It has been few years that my girlfriend didn't ride a bike and she never did it in a big city, trough traffic. Even though our guide noticed she wasn't confortable after the short test ride, he never took time to explain how to change speed, brakes, and electric assistance. He didn't not gave us any instructions about signals to so into traffic (left turn, right turn, stop...)",
        "After a 5 minutes ride, where my girlfriend's battery unhooked 2 times and made her almost fell, we stopped at the Distillery dsitrict for some exploration and pictures. We had to walk with our bike through the district and then arrive at a traffic light where we had to cross a busy intersection.",

The wheather was very nice and we did bike for about 30 km, which allowed us to take some nice pictures, even if we didn't visit any of the attractions we were supposed to. Our guide Adam took many pictures of us and sent them all the same day by email.",

Adam, our guide was also good fun to be around and is very knowledgeable about the city. He even kindly provided water and energy bars as snacks and was very flexible with our requirements.

We are seasoned travelers and exchange students to the U.S. We found Toronto eBike Rentals on Tripadvisor. The bike ride was one of it's kind, it's easy to ride in the midst of the busy traffic in downtown Toronto. We did the tour with Adam. I would highly recommend anyone to do the tour (hands down the best in Canada and probably in America, period!). Wow, What an amazing time!!! I did not paddle as much along the way and used up the battery on my bike but Adam (the tour guide) immediately swap his bike for mine. Amazing guy! Plus, you also get to go to some of the local - less-tourisee  places around the city. For CAD$99, you really can't beat that price! Overall 5/5 star! Will definitely do it again when I'm back in Toronto the next time!"

        "Our guide, Adam, made great efforts to make sure we were both comfortable and having fun throughout the tour. You cover A LOT of the city during that 4 hours! We were thankful to have seen so much and ended up finding many places to revisit later, which we weren't even aware of prior to the tour.",
        "We are both overweight and not avid cyclists, so having the electric motor really helped out whenever our legs got tired. I probably could have used the motor throughout the tour more often than I did, as the battery was still fully charged at the end of the tour. So, if you'd hesitate to take this tour because you feel you're out of shape, I would bet you'll be fine on this tour. We would definitely be interested in doing the tour of the West side of Toronto if we're ever back in that city."

        "Adam has showed me in a 4 hours tour the whole city and could tell me all about Toronto and Canada. Thank god we even walked a bit since I was not a regular cycler 😀.",

We did it on a Sunday morning and had the best of times, loved the places we visited and Adam was the perfect guide knowledgeable about the city and very friendly.  "

        "Initially we were very excited about this tour. We were originally looking for scooters to rent to show an out of town friend of ours Downtown Toronto. Upon searching we found this website and decided to give them a call to see what they were all about. We spoke to Adam on the phone who explained to us how the tour would work. He seemed very enthusiastic about the whole procedure explaining that there would be many stops along the way where we would stop for pictures, food and drinks. After the conversation with Adam it seemed like the ideal tour to take. Mind we were under the impression that we’d be going to some of the top sightseeing locations and getting to explore the city. ",
        "Leading up to the day of the tour we thought that it would be a private guided tour due to the high price and my conversation with Adam. Perhaps we were misunderstood because upon arrival we found out that we were going on the tour with an older lady who seemed to be in her later 40’s. ",
        "We met in front of the St. Lawrence Market from where we thought we were going to their office. However, instead we proceeded to a nearby parking garage where he had a couple bikes locked away where there were bike parts, boxes, and clutter everywhere – the whole experience we felt was a little shady. ",
        "Before we had even begun the tour we were at the entrance of the parkade when a car tried to pass by us, Adam almost got into an altercation with the drivers because they were trying to drive by us. The bikes looked like they were going to fall apart any second as he was duck taping the batteries to the bike right in front of us. He then showed really quickly how the bikes worked and although the 3 of us picked up on it fairly quickly the older lady accompanying us had a bit of a hard time understanding how the ebikes worked. Despite her confusion and our hesitation, being new bikers in the city, Adam started the tour. ",
        "We had explained that though we were comfortable biking in the city we had not done it in a long time, Adam continued to assure us repeatedly that many beginners had been on this tour. After Distillery District we made our way to the Portlands where Adam (an experienced biker) rode far ahead of us, which happened a lot through out the tour, and didn’t look back to see if everyone was okay. After looking through the crowd to find Adam we got off our bikes and walked towards him when the older ladies bike got stuck on throttle and ran over an innocent bystander who was going to Cabana Pool Bar – this made for an embarrassing experience as many people were looking at us. ",
        "After this we continued to ride by some of the locations listed on his site. Majority of the tour was just riding by it the sites and him explaining how much houses cost in the neighborhoods and not really stopping to experience any of it. When we spoke on the phone with Adam he explained to us that we’d be stopping at a brewery to get a sample of beer and that we would stop to get a bite to eat at Loblaws. However, neither of these events happened. We were especially disappointed with not stopping to eat at Loblaws because we had been biking for a couple hours at that point and were exhausted. We also did not see the Air Canada Center, Rogers Center, Hockey Hall of Fame, St. James Cathedral, Round House and St. Lawrence Market. ",
        "Even though the tour guide seemed friendly and knowledgeable about the city, he did seem a bit insensitive about the different previous biking experiences everyone had. For the future I recommended having a tour guide in the front leading the tour and another in the back to make sure everyone feels safe. Because even though we were younger and were comfortable riding in the city he did not accommodate and was riding at a much faster speed than what we were used to and we felt like we had to keep up. Not to mention that he, on multiple occasions, was cycling between cars very close in proximity. Even the older lady at one point mentioned to us that she regretted going on this tour. ",
        "At the end we had to come back because the older lady’s schedule and although Adam offered to take us to Lakeshore we had had enough at that point and did not want to be rude and just wanted to be on our way. For payment we did not want to bring cash with us but we also did not that they didn’t have any direct payment machine options. The only choice was to pay from our phones on paypal. ",
        "Overall, I wish I would have just gone with the scooters. The seats were really uncomfortable – my butt still hurts. Also cold water was mentioned but the water was warm. We would sincerely like to be refunded our money as we really don’t feel like it was worth the money."

        "I went on this tour as a solo traveler and ended up being the only one on the tour for the day. The guide, Adam, met me at the designated meeting place and within 5 minutes the bikes were set up and ready to go. Electric bikes are easy to use and a way to cover a lot of ground that you wouldn't normally be able to do on an ordinary bike. Adam took me all around the Toronto area and was able to explain everything we were looking at and answer my questions as well. I especially liked that he took every opportunity to take photographs at all our stopping points and then emailed all of them to me after the tour. I enjoyed the ease of using an electric bike, seeing the sights and getting a feel for riding on the downtown Toronto streets. Great tour - definitely recommend!"

        "My daughter and I booked this tour to show the most of Toronto to a student friend visiting from Austria. I thought I had seen Toronto as I regularly travel there to visit relatives, schools, attractions or social events, but this eBike tour is just the most awesome way to experience the real Toronto. We had other plans to take in Cirque Du Soleil and Toronto Harbour Cruise, so Adam and I exchanged a few emails to set up the perfect time for our eBike tour. He suggested the Sunday morning tour for us and it was absolutely the best timing. We arrived downtown early and parking was easy. The weekend was hot and humid, but the morning tour was refreshing and exciting.",
        "I am 'young at heart', but wear a knee brace for walking, and wondered if my bike inexperience would hinder the success of our tour. Not at all. We all absolutely loved the eBike tour. Adam and Ryan love their city and showed us more in four hours than we could have shown our guest in the whole weekend. We had so much fun with them and enjoyed every minute. Great guides, great tour!!"

        "An eBike? That's for sissies. I ride \"real\" bicycles. Who needs an electric assist? Let me tell you - Everybody needs it! You need it if you want to see this much of Toronto in only 4 hours.",
        "The eBike is a super invention. It's very conventional looking and riding. It has gears and pedals and works just like a regular hybrid-style bike. Until you turn on the power, that is. Start to pedal, and and in just a moment, the electric boost eases in and has you up to speed in a snap. You can set it to give you as much or as little boost as you like.",
        "Enough about the bikes. The best part of the tour was our guide, Adam. Adam knows the city and knows how to get from one place to another in a flash. He also know the story behind every neighborhood, street, and building that he takes you to. Plus he takes photos, answers stupid tourist questions, and keeps an eye on his customers.",
        "Okay, some more about the eBikes... This tour has a lot of stop and go. So much so, that anyone short of a serious athlete might run out of legs pretty quickly on regular bikes. The eBike makes this sort of tour possible."

He was so knowledgeable about all of the town, history, and really a people person. The trip was 4 hours and the eBikes' made that doable for a more mature couple with recent knee issues(me).  Adam took pictures throughout and emailed them to us.  My husband and I were the only ones on the tour and we got very personal service.  I would recommend this to anyone who likes bikes and wants to see the city in a unique and fun way."

        "This was an awesome tour and Adam is a great hospitable tour guide.  Our tour had some technical challenges, but Adam quickly resolved the issues and was willing to extend the tour timing to allow us to see everything planned.  Great customer service!  He was very knowledgeable about all the stops and with the power assisted bikes, we were definitely able to see more of the city than we would have in the same time frame with regular bikes.  Loved the bikes so much, even looked as to how to get one for our own use! I would definitely recommend this tour above any other tour that uses regular bicycles.  Also, he stated he normally only takes 4 people so its an intimate experience. My family of 3 were the only ones on the tour so it was great to have that individualized attention. The cost is a little higher than what I was originally thinking we would pay for any tour, but in the end it was totally worth it.  My husband who would normally complain about that, never made a peep and was totally excited about the tour and found it to be a good value for the money and our time.  Highly recommend Adam and his tour!!"

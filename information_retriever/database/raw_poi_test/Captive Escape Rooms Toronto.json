        "Did the Dracula's Library and it felt ... lazy. The decor was honestly very sparse. The walls were mostly bare white, with few decorations/props, or even furniture. At every turn, it felt like someone took an empty room and dumped some puzzle pieces inside, rather than a real place. It was also lacking many basic features, like a clock, walkie talkies, or monitoring cameras. Instead, they tell you to use  your phones to track time.  To get hints, you press a buzzer and a staff member opens the door, walks in, and asks you to explain what's happening. ",
        "Speaking of puzzles, just about every lock was a number/alphabet combination lock, which got boring fast. The puzzle pieces were also cheap and worn out, which sometimes made it hard to read whatever words were on it. One puzzle in particular towards the end relied on some shoddy props that can easily give you an incorrect hint (simply due to the imprecise visuals). ",
        "Finally, unlike many other escape rooms where they ask you to not mess with fixed props, some puzzles actually relied on moving/messing with furniture/fixed props.  This would have been fine if the staff bothered telling us this. Instead, they asked whether we've done escape rooms before and then just said \"yeah it's pretty much the same\".  One particular puzzle needed us to move some heavy yet very unstable props (definitely not safe if you have kids). As mentioned before, there are no cameras inside, which means we were hesitant to mess with some fixed props, just in case they ended up damaging the rooms.",
        "Overall, very lazy and unpolished. Definitely not worth the $30 bucks."

They offer multiple stories with multiple rooms in each story. This is one of the few escape room places that offer games for 2 players. Most rooms force you to be at least a party of 4. Here they offer at least 3 different stories for 2 players and I think there is a fourth one as well. Been here a few times now and will definately return."

        "We came here for a team building event.  There were 11 of us so we had to go with the  Cabinet of Curiosity.  The entrance is a little tucked away so you really need to look for 43 Elm.  Once you open the door, you have to walk up a flight of stairs (don't think there are any elevators) and it's pretty dark so take your time and make sure you don't miss a step.  Once we got to the top, we opened up another door and walked into Captive Rooms.  There's a small waiting area where you can hang up your jackets, have a quick drink of water and check out some of the decor.  We were suppose to arrive 15 min earlier so they could explain the game to us.  They also did a head count to make sure we were the right # of attendees.  We had give our phones to them to make sure we don't take any pics of the room - guess for proprietary reasons? I won't be going into the details of of the game itself but overall, I would say that the puzzles were quite challenging and the rooms quite small.  The staff who was explaining things to us wasn't very good at times - he would say something but then backtrack - like he didn't memorize the script properly, however he was super nice!  My biggest issue with the game were the locks - the chinese character lock was sooooo finicky to open so we actually wasted a lot of them not solving the puzzles but trying to line up the combination on the lock.  We were given an extra 10 mins but it was still quite frustrating.  The puzzles were quite creative and I liked how they were linear.  Side note, none of the rooms were technically \"locked\" so at times, we would just open the door to let some fresh air come through.  We ended up escaping which we were very happy about.  The picture area at the end was a nice touch.  Overall, I recommend Captive Room but if you wanted something that was more elaborate, I would suggest going to Casa Loma instead."

Staff (Gavin, Dion, David) did an amazing job of helping us through the rooms, giving helpful hints that allowed the group to figure out solutions without being given the answer, and were very professional throughout. They even offered to bring water inside the room since one of our friends was thirsty, which I thought was exceptional customer service. The time ended in the photo room where they had a variety of props to wear. I would recommend this place to everyone if you're looking for an escape room to visit in Toronto."

        "Drove 3 hours to get here, got stuck in a storm and ended up being late for our appointment. Called ahead and tried to see what we could do. Basically got told we were out of luck and if we weren‚Äôt there at least 15 minutes after our appointment the timer would start. Which is not stated on the website. Asked about changing our time or doing another day got told in a very rude fashion there was nothing. We decided to try our luck. Got to the approximate location 20 minutes into our time and spent another 20 trying to find the place due to very poor signage. Once we got there some employees were nice, many were rude teenagers. They insisted on going over all of the instructions, which we appreciated, however failed to mention some very important safety concerns regarding the Surgeon room. Half of our team was uncomfortable and slightly injured in the process. During the room when we asked for clues the staff members were abrasive and brash, flew through the hints very fast- I assume to aid in our short time left, but came off very rude. After our time we were told there was a photo both and decided we wanted to get a pic. One of our members went to the bathroom and when they came out none of the employees seemed to care about us- no see ya later, have a good night, nothing.. focussed on the new people that had shown up for their time. So we had to leave empty handed. We have been to many escape rooms and have never been treated in this manner. We understand that being late was on our end however we wish the staff was kinder and offered more of an alternative. ",

As previous reviewers have said, there is a lot of math. A lot. Like 85% of it is math, and the rest is physically searching. There was a puzzle that we got, but we it was just a guess and we have no idea how or why the answer was what it was. Despite using all our hints + extra, and being given around 10 minutes of extra time, we did not escape. Regardless it was still fun. If you are afraid of ladders or very steep stairs, be aware that you have a very steep climb and decent to get in and out of the room.",

We ended up using 3 hints (you're allowed 2 if you want to be on their success board), and we got out with 2 minutes to spare.",

I highly suggest checking Captive out the next time you're cruising for something exciting to do."

        "We are experienced escape room players with more than 20 wins. So we have seen our fair share of escape rooms in various countries. I will keep spoilers out of this review. ",
        "The staff at Captive Escape were very friendly and the introduction was comprehensive. They use a 'bell system' for clues, where someone from the staff will step into the room and help you with clues. They were always very quick to respond when we had questions while in-game. ",
        "The room 'the surgeon' is rather small and it might get crowded with 4 of more players, but it can also be solved with only 2 players. The game flow was basically linear, so a big group might not be able work in parallel much. This is not a mechanical escape room like 'Escape Casa Loma' or 'Mysterious Minds', so expect a lot of numbers and combination locks. ",
        "Unfortunately it looks like the room has already seen a lot of plays and the wear on the furniture already gives some clues regarding the riddles. On the other hand there are pen/scratch marks from previous players that might lead you on the wrong path. ",
        "We also had issues with several of the combination locks due to their worn out state. Even with the right codes they needed a good wiggle and some force to open. We wasted time and several clues just to confirm that the code 'should' work. ",
        "The riddles are very number-centric. Generally there are no clues in the game that would give a hint on how to proceed with the numbers: Do you add them? Do you look for patterns? Do you work with the missing numbers? Do you convert the numbers to roman numerals? Should the numbers represent time / date? I feel that just trying out various combinations without a clear direction until you find the right one is pretty tedious, but your mileage may vary. ",
        "Pro: super staff, cool serial-killer setting",
        "Neutral: annoying music, very linear, small room",
        "Con: worn out locks, lots of try-and-error when checking possible results"

Today, more than 225,000 patrons and over 50,000 students visit the Orchestra at Roy Thomson Hall each year, and an additional five million Canadians tune in to concert broadcasts on CBC Radio. Under the leadership of Music Director Peter Oundjian, the Orchestra has increased recording and touring projects to include a self-produced record label, and performances throughout the US and Canada. The Orchestra continues to develop its international presence by being an active commissioning body for new Canadian and international works, as well as attracting distinguished guest artists and conductors to performances at Roy Thomson Hall.",

        "It had been some time since we last heard the TSO play, and Sunday afternoon's concert was a splendid reintroduction. The conductor was Tarmo Peltokoski, a 22-year-old (!) Filipino-Finnish maestro who gave an excellent and energetic account of himself. The first piece was a brief and rather dreamy piece by Kaija Saariaho. This was followed by a spirited rendition of the Brahms Violin Concerto, with the TSO's concert master Jonathan Crow as the soloist. He performed splendidly, as did the orchestra. The post-intermission work was Shostakovich's 5th Symphony, which was suitable noisy in places and highly listenable throughout. Well done, TSO!"

He quipped that he’s often told, “You have to hear this violinist,” when that’s not often the case. But that the encounter with Chooi made him  want to bring him to perform with the TSO. Didn’t hurt either that Chooi is Canadian. ",

It was an amazing experience! Reineke opened by inviting the audience to cheer, boo, hiss at their favourite moments in the picture, and to occasionally watch the orchestra working hard (they played continuously for the last hour per John Williams score). RTH even made the evening more friendly by allowing drinks and snacks inside the auditorium (how civilized can we become?).",

The orchestra and Reineke were accorded an extended standing ovation at the end of the performance (one of those rare times where everyone stays until the credits have finished).",

Given the Home Alone movie was being screened as part of the performance with the TSO playing the  background music, I think it would have been enjoyed by very young children with a nice intro to symphony music in the process. The ESA choir didn't start to sing until after the intermission, but were amazingly good and received loud and unanimous applause for each song they performed. There was a minor glitch where the picture on the screen went dark for 5 minutes or so - just the sound, but that was when the choir was singing so it wasn't a disaster and the picture returned to great applause as well.

Now that it about a month to December, I called them to redeem my tickets and got told that the tickets can only be redeemed during the 2016/2017 season which ended in September. I went on to explain that I understood their original reassurance to mean that I could redeem the tickets in the next \"year\" which to me meant until December 2017.

The hall is beautiful and I found acoustically well balanced.  I had fretted over which seating section might be the best and had asked advice of the symphony’s telephone sales agent.  Since there was a violin concerto, she recommended right orchestra so we would be facing her directly.  It was a good choice.  However, generally, it seemed to me that all of the seats in the house except perhaps the back orchestra under the balcony would be good.  If you like watching the trombones, go for the balcony.

It can produce a fierce sound when it lets loose on prominent Romantic pieces despite a somewhat smaller size than would be appropriate; it is also capable of very delicate work on more modernist rep. The string section sometimes lacks body though the middle and is can be overpowered by the woodwind and brass sections. A minor complaint is the fidgety horn players; the trombone and trumpet sections seem perfectly capable of sitting still during rests but the horn players were quite noticeable constantly emptying, adjusting, or raising earlier than their section-mates.

Their programs are wonderful, their guests conductors are world known and admired, and our in-house conductor for the last 10 years have inspired the musicians to the higher excellence!! We both love sitting in our regular seats, and the moment the lights go down, I enter a magical world!! ",

        "It’s a no frills, bare minimum bar but that’s exactly all it needs to be and tries to be. There are two pool tables in the back. They show sports. They have an outdoor patio in the summer. Lots of tables inside. It’s great. It’s good for anything from going to watch the game to a low key casual date. All the food is excellent and the wait staff is friendly. ",
        "If I have one complaint it’s that sometimes homeless folks or drug addicts randomly choose outside the restaurant as a place to stand. But it’s Queen St W next to Parkdale so you can’t be too surprised. ",

        "Terrific burgers, nachos and other pub style food at normal prices.  Cocktails are overpriced and horrible.  For example, we ordered Old Fashioned cocktails.  They were $14 each and when I asked what type of bourbon they used, they said Forty Creek.  I said a rye whiskey from Grimsby, Ontario is no substitute for a premium Kentucky bourbon and at least half the cost.  Beer was a good selection.  Service was good.  Very much a dive, with bathrooms that had no paper towels on a Saturday night, as well as out of order everything!  ",

        "I am a Parkdale resident and I wanted to say that this is one of the last classic pubs in Parkdale. Rhino is OG.  When The Rhino turns into condo's or a hipster vegan place, Parkdale is dead to me. ",
        "They have a huge parking lot turned into a patio, and if you want to smoke you can walk to the back and have no issues.  They also allow dogs on the patio from time to time, so if you are stuffy and want to complain about smokes and dogs, go down the street and you will find Vegandale and lots of beards. ",
        "And oh, speaking of meat lovers and non vegans,  the Rhino burger is the best lots of meat and they mix it together with more meat and spices. ",
        "They have a massive beer menu, bu the wine selection is small and meh but they added a summer cocktail menu that is reasonably priced and boozy. ",
        "Do not expect fancy here, the table and chairs are all probably from the 80's lots of wood and wooden panels in this place, including 80's style pool tables. I wish they did not get rid of the Jukebox.   ",
        "Lots of space in here, massive bar, and don't judge them on the creepy basement bathrooms, there is a reason why the prices are cheap.",
        "This place is a Parkdale classic, so if you are looking for an authentic Parkdale experience I would highly recommend this place and know you are sitting in history."

Our waitress could have visited more frequently to take drink orders and check on everything, and it took about 30-45 minutes for us to get our bills and settle up - well before last call. Despite this, I would visit again. "

No live music or anything....inside is a decent atmosphere.  It's a 'hang out for locals'.  Many of them know most of the staff...food is pretty good.  Nachos were impressive also.  Tough parking.....hipsters hangin' out."

The food here is excellent value for money and don't take the low cost to be indicative of the quality, they have quite a number of unusual dishes and the ones we have tried have all been very good. They have Mados wings which have a curried flavor to them and they are one of my favorite dishes there but anything I have tried there I have enjoyed.",

This a place to get some good cheap beer, hang out with your friends and have a drink while you wait for your table across the street. Service is a little slow but its never unattentive, and it's not the cleanest place in the world but that shouldn't stop you from being here. Its a good simple dive with cheap beer and if you expect anything else you should probably go elsewhere."

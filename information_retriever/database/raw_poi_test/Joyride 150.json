        "When I went i rented a bike, the bike seat kept twisting and turning causing me to not bike properly, there was no air in the bike and it kept making a squeaking sound. When  was doing the pump track, my bars went fully down causing me to crash. This is so stupid.  I do not recommend going here because of the poor quality. ALSO DONT GO IN THE WASHROOMS POOP EVERYWHERE AND SOMETIMES KIDS GOOFING AROUND."

The rental bikes and helmets are in very good condition. You can bring your own food or order in. They also have some snacks and drinks for sale.  Staff is very friendly."

        "Took my 15 year old son here and he had a great time biking this enormous biking facility. The place has biking courses of various difficulty levels so he could progress in difficulty at his own speed. Cost for bike, gear and entry was $50 and is good for the entire day. Next time we will arrive in the morning for a few hours of biking, go out for lunch and then come back. Staff very friendly. Parking close to entrance is packed but if you are willing to park a little further away then there is plenty of parking. Highly recommend this place."

        "This was our third visit to Joyride and again the kids had a great day. If you want a safe place to wear out busy kids, this is it. You can rent bikes or bring your own, same with helmets and knee/elbow pads. It's really an all ages place as the place is huge and there's lots of room for different skill levels. The structures are all in good repair and the signage is good. There is a large seating area with picnic tables and you can bring in your own food, order in pizza or leave to eat and come back on a day pass. There are microwaves to warm up your food. They also have a canteen type counter where you can purchase snacks and drinks. Plenty of places to plug in devices if you need to work while kids play, or to charge phones. There is wifi, but on a busy day it's overwhelmed and you won't be able to get on.",
        "I'm rating 4 stars instead of 5 for a couple reasons. ",
        "1- it could use a good cleaning in the eating/seating section. There are spots on the walls where food or drinks have been splashed and dried/stuck to the walls. Eww. ",
        "2- there should be a second water fountain at the back near the bathrooms, and water fountains need to have a tall tap for refilling water bottles. ",
        "3- it's cold in there! I get it can stand to be a bit cooler because the cyclists are active and will get hot, but it's cold, not cool. Wore my jacket most of the day. Warmer in the seating area but not warm. ",
        "4- there's not enough staff. This visit was during march break so the place was really busy but there was NO staff around the ramps, jumps etc to referee the odd disagreement about who's turn it is, help clear up traffic jams when someone falls or police a few rules. For the most part there is seldom issues between riders, but on a busy day a couple staff on the floor would definitely make a difference."

        "My husband brought me here for my birthday. It was AMAZING. The staff was friendly and helpful. The fellow guests were all SO kind, thoughtful, and informative. The place was designed with everyone in mind. People of all ages and levels were simultaneously enjoying the park. It was laid out well and had something to challenge any cyclist. The rental gear was excellent, definitely get the shin guards if you'll be enjoying the foam pit. I can also say, that should your husband forget his age and crash, the medic on staff is wonderful and the hospital just a ten-minute drive away. We can't wait to come back and stay longer!"

        "I took my young son and brought his bike. We rode all of the beginner area, pump track, XC track and did the skinnies and the green and blue jumps. we stayed for 3 hours and could have really stayed all day. you can order pizza and they call your name. you can host in a party room. they rent bikes, pads, helmets and have snacks and pizza to purchase. it's sometimes crowded but no one gets upset. everybody just patiently waits their turn and rides! you can bring a lock and use day-use lockers to keep stuff. Wear good stiff soled shoes, shorts or pants is ok and a t-shirt is fine. bring a water bottle that you can fill up at the water fountains."

        "Great diversity of features - we spent most of our time on the pump tracks and jumps, but it was fun to watch riders trying out their moves into the foam pit. We aren't bmx riders, but had a great time on the rented bmx bikes. Staff were friendly and made it really easy to spend a day here - microwaves available near the picnic tables if you bring your own food (many families did), and they're happy to have you order in food or buy food onsite. Overall a great experience for all [active] ages!"

        "We took our friends' 9 year old here for his birthday and he (along with his Dad and I) had an absolute blast.  Very efficient check in and payment system.  $25 or so for a day including bike/helmet rental.  The beginner area got a bit busy in the afternoon, but that is probably because the pump tracks there are so much fun for every level.  Anyway that just meant we checked out other areas.  The kid had an amazing day and so did we.  We were there just over 3 hours, going non-stop but will plan for longer next time.  Staff are super friendly and everything runs really smoothly.  Definitely will be back."

      "title": "BEST BOYS BIRTHDAY PARTY EVER AT JOYRIDE 150 BIKE PARK",
      "text": [
        "My son Jayden had been counting down to his birthday for months. Over the summer, we had looked online and visited some local outdoor skateparks and hit Joyride (it's $17 after 7pm) to practice for the big day! Jayden recently had his 9th birthday party at Joyride 150 Bike Park in Markham with 12 of his best buddies. \"Best Party Ever\" was echoed by my biggest critics...and of course the best part of hosting a kids' birthday party is seeing your child and their friends having the greatest time....now they all want their next birthday party at the same place!",
        "What you can expect from a party at Joyride 150;",
        "1. Booking a party at Joyride 150 was really easy. The party includes 3 hours at the park, which was more than enough time (of course three kids stayed an extra half hour for more fun on the ramps). You can use the 3 hours however you like and you have the party room for the entire time! This was great for the kids to come take a rest, have a snack and drink of water before they got back out on the ramps and circuits.",
        "2. Incredible variety of activities for all bikers: There really was something for all the bikers at our party. You really have to be a confident bike rider to enjoy the full experience at the park. I would definitely recommend that kids should be 8 or older to have good judgement when it comes to knowing their limits. There is a beginner and intermediate area where we spent most of our time, including the very awesome foam pit. The \"black diamond\" area was out of our skill level, but the kids just loved watching some of the pros. Even some of the grown ups got in on the fun and tried the ramps and trails.",
        "3.  Great Supervision and Safety: All parents have to complete the online (and very easy) waiver to have contact info on file. We were required to send the full list of attendees, two days before the party, so that they could check that all waivers were completed.The day of the party, we were assigned one of the staff to oversee our party, so at the very beginning of the party, he rallied the kids to talk rules and safety. He was great with the kids and checked on us several times...even when we needed some ice for a fall. When it came to leaving, it was all organized and ready for me to pay!",
        "4.  Clean and Stress-free Party Room: We had the large party room and it was really massive and had painted picnic benches for the kids to sit and eat their pizza. They had several tables where we put our snacks and drinks and the fridge was great to keep things cold. Not only was it spacious and secluded, but for a kid who LOVES purple, it also required no decorating!",
        "5. Reasonable Cost: Parties are expensive! I found Joyride 150 reasonable at the cost of $20 per child ($30 with rentals) and that includes 3 hours at the park! That's great value. No food is included so you must order your own pizza and you are also allowed to bring in any food you like (it bugs me when other party places make you buy their overpriced food!). The large party room also has a fridge to keep drinks, veggies, fruit and cake cold while the kids play!",
        "If you want to learn more about half pipes, jump lines, dirt jumps, and resis...this is the perfect place to book a kid's, tween or teen's party!"

        "I would recommend kids be at least 12 years of age & not younger because they can not judge danger, speed and manevours. Plus there a great chance of bashing into walls, poles, siding, ramps, jumps, apparatus, pits and so on even if you an adult. ",
        "Know your limits. Expect to wipe out. Have enuf speed to master ramps, learn methods of stopping and figure out how to handle yourself in case you get into trouble. ",

        "If you are trying this place for the first time go to beginners level and stay there until you have conquered all the feats. ",
        "Have plenty of speed when peddling up onto the ramps otherwise your bike will suddenly stop, tumble over with you on it or it will fall back and take you with it. ",
        "You will bash your knees if you not careful and you must be able to stop suddenly and be prepared to jump off with ease.",
        "Been here several times with my kid. Enjoyed the feeling of adventure, loved flying through the air & mastering jumps for the first time & biking on narrow platforms, etc. Annually there is a weekend devoted to females. Summer camps for the kids too.",

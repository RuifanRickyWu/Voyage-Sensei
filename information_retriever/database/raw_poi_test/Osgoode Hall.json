  "description": "Visit our website to learn about free summer tours of Osgoode Hall. A National Historic Site of Canada, Osgoode Hall has been delighting visitors since it first opened in 1832. As the current home of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, the Superior Court of Justice and the Law Society of Ontario, it is a hub of legal activity in downtown Toronto and the heart of Ontario’s legal heritage. The grounds sit on six acres in the core of downtown Toronto, bordered by mature trees, lush gardens and the famous iron palisade. Comprised of several buildings constructed over time, Osgoode Hall is a mix of late Georgian, Palladian and Neoclassical influences and is one of the few remaining examples of mid-19th century Ontario institutional landscapes. There are many ways to learn about Osgoode Hall, home of the Law Society of Ontario, the Court of Appeal for Ontario and the Superior Court of Justice.",

It is currently the home of the Law Society of Ontario. This Canadian national historic site was enlarged in 1844,1855,1880 and 1891 and it's great library houses the largest private collection of legal material in Canada. This 6 acre site is located in the heart of Toronto and is surrounded by a cast iron fence built in 1867.

One of the brick wings was built in the 1820s while the stone centre building was added in the 1830s and is now the entrance to the building. The last brick wing was added in the 1840s to balance off the facade. The brick wings are in the neo-classical style with large pillared porticoes while the central main building is in the British Neo-Palladian style. Inside is a large pillared two story main hall with tiles floors and a stained glass ceiling. There are old paintings and heavy Victorian chairs and many doors leading to the elegant courtrooms. Up a grand staircase and on the second floor is one of the finest rooms in Ontario. This is the large and ornately decorated law library. It is surprisingly elegant and must have been quite a place in 19th Century Toronto. This courthouse is well worth a visit."

Every summer the staff of the Law Society volunteer to run lunchtime tours of this beautiful building and tell you of its rich history - not just legal history but the political, cultural and military history of Ontario. You'll see the monuments to the members of the legal community who lost their lives in the two world wards. You'll see the current Court of Appeal for Ontario. You will see the Great Library, the first law school for Ontario (which is now the setting for a fantastic restaurant at lunchtime - not in the summer) and you'll see where the Benchers (the elected governing body of the lawyers and paralegals in Ontario). The tour is great and it's free. The building is beautiful and its stories intriging.

The halls and staircases are decorated with portraits of famous judges and lawyers (all men from what we saw).

There was no excuse to get lost or miss a room because visitors were provided with a 2-page detailed handout at the entrance, there were attendants at every room and the walls were peppered with directional signages/arrows which were impossible to miss. Personally, I think the signs were excessive but, hey, they have been doing Doors Open for years and the signs were obviously effective.",

The 3-tiered seating was explained to us—senior lawyers at the front, other lawyers next and students at the back. We particularly liked the American room in the GREAT LIBRARY, with its old-school vibe, centuries-old hardbound books, creaky wooden floors and spiral staircase, in total contrast to the big and bright main reading room which was mostly cordoned off with ugly “Caution Do Not Enter” yellow tape. Here visitors have no choice but to walk down the corridor, stop briefly at the World War I Memorial at the end and proceed to the next suite of rooms, BENCHER’S QUARTERS. ",

At the Convocation room, we were told that the Treasurer’s chair at the head of the table is an original, circa 1860’s. The CONVOCATION HALL, which was the last stop inside the building, is a large handsome hall with chandeliers, a 4-sided hanging clock, torch light sconces and stained glass windows. During Doors Open, sandwiches and drinks were on sale here, as well as souvenir t-shirts. ",
        "On our way out of Osgoode Hall, I overheard some people complaining about the narrow opening at the glass partition near the entrance, and I agree, it was a squeeze getting through it, with people entering and exiting at the same time. The FRONT/facade seemed to be a favourite for wedding entourage photos because earlier there were 2 wedding parties posing for pics on either side. The unusual gates on the iron FENCE got a second look from us before we finally left the premises."

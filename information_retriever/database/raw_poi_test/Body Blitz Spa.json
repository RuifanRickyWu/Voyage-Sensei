They still ask for proof of vaccination (even though it was cancelled in the province on March 1) and make you wear a mask EVERYWHERE (even in a pool) (except for steam room - wow). Mask becomes wet, makes it hard to breather but no one cares. Funny enough you must wear a mask but you don't have to wear the top of your swim suit. Feels like you are in prison as employees watch very thoroughly and if the mask goes down even a bit, they make sure to tell you that. No way you can relax and enjoy experience.

Usually, when I go to high-end spas,  refreshments are for free, and very often they offer a glass of champagne at the end.

There is only one shower area with frosted glass that is used by those rinsing between pools and after you are done.  There is a small stool outside that is always wet so you have to hang your stuff on the hook across from the stalls.  This means that you will be fully exposed as you grab your towel.",

The doors to the rooms are not full length so they are open on top and the bottom so you can hear things from the other rooms and the hallway.

        "Excessive levels of chlorine: midway through my spa visit, I started sneezing incessantly, my skin started to break into a rash, and my eyes started burning to the point that I could not read the reading material I had brought. As mentioned, I’ve been here many times and have never experienced this issue, leading me to believe that for some reason the levels were excessive on this particular day. These issues resulted in me staying for about half the time I normally do (at close to $70 dollars for entry, this is a real bummer) and went home feeling extremely sick. The effects (headache, runny nose, and other “cold-like” symptoms) lingered for 24 hours afterwards.  Researching online, I found that these symptoms matched those of over-exposure to chlorine, and that they should pass in 24 hours after exposure. They lasted almost exactly 24 hours and I spent the entire time in bed.",
        "Excessive noise: There was a long wait time on the day I visited, indicating that it was a busy day overall, but the levels of noise in the facility were excessive. It is a social spa, but it's also located in a warehouse, and with loud conversations being had by most groups, you could barely hear yourself think. It was the opposite of relaxing and I had to use ear plugs when in the main area. There are signs around the facility suggesting that conversations should be in hushed tone, I mean this isn’t a seaside pool in a vacation destination during spring break. But there was no attempt made by any of the staff to manage the levels of noise.",
        "Dirty facility: the facility itself feels old and like it’s falling apart a bit. My locker was broken, which I only realized when I went back to double check. In addition I was looking to buy one of their facial scrubs (which have a very high price point at over $45 dollars) or other beauty products and when I looked on the back, they were expired! This is not the marker of a high quality spa using high quality products. ",
        " ",
        "In light of all of these issues and my normally positive visits, I assumed that the spa would want to properly address my concerns and would provide me with some kind of compensation for the experience, or some incentive to come again once the issues were resolved. I mean the spa made me sick! This was not the case. The customer service at Body Blitz is apparently non-existent if you have a concern. Not that the girls pay much attention to you when everything is a-ok, but they have absolutely no process for dealing with customer concerns. Buyer beware I guess. This is a very successful spa judging by the number of clients and their ability to open additional locations. But they were not willing to address a situation which they acknowledged was “outside of the norm”.",
        "I would suggest saving your money for a trip to Spa Scandinave (awesome experience and customer service all around) instead of visiting this overpriced spa, with limited concern for their guests enjoyment or health, as evidenced by their response to my recent issues. The fact that they can continue to flourish as a business while not taking a genuine customer service issue to heart and indicating some responsibility and attempt to rectify the issue is really unfortunate in a city with so many options."

There were lots of chairs and spaces available on the weeknight I visited.  It was nice having everything indoors for the Winter, but still prefer the outdoor Scandinave spa settings.  The spa was on the pricey side if you spend only an hour there."

        "I have lived in the King West neighbourhood for over the past 10 years and have always considered this place one of King West’s hidden gems. I used to love coming here to treat myself. Before my trip this week, the last time I was here was about a year ago and boy has it changed. ",
        "From check-in to treatment to the time I left I found almost all the staff to be abrupt or borderline unfriendly. I took off my slippers about 3 feet from the pool so that I could get into the pool and within seconds I was being reprimanded for not wearing my slippers on the pool deck. When I told the attendant, “but I’m getting into the pool” she just said ok with a bit of a tone and walked away. ",
        "To be fair, when I was checking in, one of the front desk girls seemed to be fielding what seemed like a rather abusive phone call. I know they’ve had some bad PR over the past couple years and maybe they have had to put up with a lot of BS from the public lately. Perhaps this is what is causing them to be more aggressive than in the past? I’m trying to give them the benefit of the doubt, but it doesn’t change the fact that’s it’s hard to enjoy what should be a peaceful spa experience when most of the staff act like they don’t want to be there. I say most because there was one shining star. Maricar was extremely pleasant and helpful to me while I was there. Almost made up for the rest.",
        "The spa was very busy and noisy compared to how it used to be. I assumed it was due to the holidays but from seeing some other recent reviews I guess this is the new normal. ",
        "When I called to book the appointment, was a little unnerved to hear they had my credit card “saved on file”. No reason for this as I haven’t used them in about a year. As someone in cyber security, this raised some red flags for me. ",
        "I may or may not come back for the waters but will be getting my massages at Hammam in the future. It’s a shame what they have become. This place used to be really special."

        "I really enjoy coming here. The staff are all very friendly and professional, the atmosphere is tranquil and the circuit is very calming. I always have a chance to clear my head when I visit body blitz. My last visit I decided to have a massage (which was one of the best I have ever had) and a body scrub. I was quite disappointed with the scrub, it felt sterile and similar to what I imagine one would feel when getting prepped for surgery. My scrub was supposed to be 25 minutes, it was much less. I left feeling like I spent $80.00 on a treatment that I would have preferred never to have had. I really urge the company to rethink how they do the scrub service, and possibly rethink the price point as well. If a massage is essentially just over $100 for an hour, by a RMT then the scrub which lasts less then 20 minutes should be much less. Just my thoughts."

        "I am from Calgary and was in Toronto from March 27-29 on business. I love spa experiences so I looked up best spas online and found body blitz to be rated at the top for women. I was very impressed with the actual set up of the healing waters and all the facilities were clean and comfortable. I wasn't bothered by the chatting while in the main pool area however in the sauna and steam room where it very clearly states no talking allowed, people still chatted loudly resulting in other people leaving. I thought this was inconsiderate and should be addressed. I also had a 60min massage. The treatment room and area is very basic. The massage itself was good however I had asked for my scalp to be focused on and this was overlooked. Before I could mention it again the massage was over! For the amount of money spent, I expect heated massage bed, warm towels, eye covers, and a small pillow for various parts of the massage. This is what is offered in my favourite spa in Calgary for about the same cost. I'm honestly being picky however for the money I expected more."

I was very comfortable. I felt amazing after. Loved that the staff took pictures for me, outside the spa. Make sure you treat yourself to the different drinks. We had a smoothie It was amazing, very tasty, filling, and totally helped with the spa experience. WOW..really worth the drive! Enjoy!!"

        "My thoughtful daughters surprised me with a spa day recently at Body Blitz. I'd never been here but one of my kids has been a number of times and really enjoys it. She has gone alone and with friends. I overpacked, not sure what to bring and was pleasantly surprised to find that they had everything ready and waiting. They even provided locks for the lockers (which I brought!), and inside, was a stack of neatly folded towels and your spa robe for your visit. They also supply you with rubber slippers (and yes, I brought my own flip flops), plus there is a vanity room for the end of your visit where you can take care of hair and makeup if you choose to, fully stocked with all of the necessities (no curling or flat irons so you're on your own there!).",

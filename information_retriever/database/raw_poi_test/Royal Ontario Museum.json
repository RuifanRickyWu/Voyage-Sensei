  "description": "Opened in 1914, the Royal Ontario Museum (ROM) showcases art, culture, and nature from around the globe and across the ages. One of North America's most renowned cultural institutions, Canada's largest museum is home to a world-class collection of more than six million objects and specimens, featured in 40 gallery and exhibition spaces. As the country’s preeminent field research institute and an international leader in new and original findings in biodiversity, palaeontology, earth sciences, the visual arts, material culture and archaeology, the ROM plays a vital role in advancing our global understanding of the artistic, cultural and natural world.",

        "It has been close to a decade since I last visited the ROM, and I wanted to see it again.  On a Tuesday my Canadian colleague and I entered just as the ROM opened and after paying our admission fee we began our examination of the exhibits.  As we typically do in museums, we started at the top floor and worked our way down.  The third floor was devoted to Ancient Greece, Ancient Cyprus, Bronze Age Aegean, Rome, Nubia, Egypt, Byzantium, Africa, and Europe.  On the second floor were exhibits on biodiversity and animals.  And the first floor contained exhibits from Korea, China, and First Peoples.  This is a fascinating museum; unfortunately, the quality of our visit deteriorated around 10:30 AM, when multiple classes of poorly supervised grade and high school children on field trips invaded the building.  While going from the second to first floor on an obscure elevator, we were informed by a staff member that school field trips frequently occur on Tuesdays.  We made our way around these loud and ill-behaved juveniles and decided to conclude our visit after two hours.  As we left the ROM, we noticed a number of yellow school buses lined up on the street adjacent to the museum."

The bad food left a stronger imprint than the excellent museum education did.",

Vancouver Aquarium food is also pretty darn good - ocean wise, affordable, and tasty.  The food at Ripley Aquarium and the ROM were huge disappointments (same with Centreville although not a museum).  For a \"must-see\" attraction in a major metropolis ROM (and perhaps Toronto tourist locales as a whole) should take a page from BC and Alberta's books and up their culinary offerings."

On my last couple of visits, I went to the well-curated special exhibition on wild cats (I heard a lot of people say 'aww' to the models of the cats) which included details of the anatomy of cats, their behavior and interactions with humans. I also got to see the sections on Byzantine and Roman art, which nicely showcased the evolution of art in the Mediterranean over the centuries. I was pleased to have seen the gallery about the First Nations of Canada, which is still an ongoing project but I admire the efforts to include the perspectives of indigenous Canadians on their art and crafts.",

My favorite exhibits were the Dinosaurs, the Egyptian, and the Ancient Chinese exhibit.  I was also lucky enough to go when the Wildlife Photographer of the Year exhibit was open.  Some of those pictures were so wildly vivid that I thought I was inside of the photo!  The staff was very helpful and there are free maps available near the entrance that help guide you through the entire Museum.  It reminded me a lot of the Museum of Natural History in Manhattan, which is my all time favorite museum.  Thank you Royal Ontario Museum for a 5 star historic museum experience!"

Without including special exhibitions which are extra. I have been to New York and residents get suggested ticket price more as a form of donation. Because they pay taxes. I have been in Europe and in London England museums are free. Again donations are welcome. But with inflation, charging a single mother with one child $53 and change amount of dollars for a few hours in a museum. Seem abusive and pure robbery. The museum itself is in construction right now so there is a lot of blocked areas that you can not get to see. Still full price and very very expensive for the average Canadian. This Museum is the only choice for a lot of people with children specially in winter when outdoor activities are limited, but who can afford this? ",

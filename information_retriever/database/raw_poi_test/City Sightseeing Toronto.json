Not sure they’ve had mush training. Keen to look up the answer to a question. Yes the bus had a stop for comfort and coffee around no 12 but we were cold so great to warm up and have a drink. We paid a few dollars more to do the boat trip as well. Not bad but did lack professionalism and consistency when staff charged."

You can buy discounted tickets on the bus for attractions close to where the bus stops.  The weather wasn’t great and when there is rain forecast, they give out plastic rain capes if you’re going onto the top deck.  At one point, they did stop slightly longer to allow people to come downstairs when the heavy rain started.  Definitely a great way to get your bearings on the city, and we discovered that our hotel was closer to some attractions than we had realised.  Recommended."

The tour covers a lot of area, and I really appreciated my guide (Punch) adding a lot of details about local food and sites that I can come back to on my next visit."

Our second guide was Punch and if we had been on his bus the whole time it would have been 5 star. He was brilliant, gave so much detailed information and was very easy to listen to. The previous guide wasn’t as great and lacked knowledge. As an example he mentioned the number of floors between 2 parts of CN tower was challenged and then said, between 10 and 20 floors. This was typical of his speel, he also tended to shout and was quite hard to understand at times. We also had a 10 minute break when the driver went for a coffee much to the guides surprise. The boat trip as part of the trip was good with an interesting guide."

        "It has been a really disappointing experience this time. While most of the times I had enjoyed city sightseeing bus tours in various cities across the world, Toronto one is far from good. We had a 48 hour pass and maybe it was just bad luck that both days our \"tour guides\" were more fascinated by celebrities than any of Toronto's history. I am sure there are way more interesting stories to tell about this wonderful city than pointing out the police station to say that was where Justin Bieber had been arrested, pointing out the arena to say that Nikki Minaj had played there, or mention TIFF only to say that she, the your guide, had seen Selena Gomez in the street and failed to take a picture of her. The point of mentioning Roger center was only to point out what a bad team Bluejays were. Both guides were focused on celebrity spotting recounting and really didn't tell us much of anything interesting about the city. Which was a real shame. I didn't fly across the world to pay and listen to someone tell me about their interest in Selena Gomez or Justin Bieber. "

There were also multiple prerecorded tour guides in different languages and even an English track if you didn't like the tour guide's schtick.  He always checked multiple times if people planned to get off at a stop and would check before leaving in case there were people who decided at the last minute. ",

Michael, our tour guide did an amazing job! He was super knowleadgeable (as proper Toronto local) and provided lots of interesting information about Toronto, cool facts about Canada as well as the Niagara Falls and all the other places we visited. He gave us great tipps where to shop/eat/drink and was super entertaining with his witty humor. He really turned this tour into an enjoyable tour. Michael was very helpful and patient with showing everyone where they need to go for the boat/leisure time at the Niagara Falls and was super well organized. As well as for the tour itself, the programme was very cool! I was very happy to walk around in the charming little town of Niagara on the Lake and the wine tasting at the end was just the perfect ending to a long tour day. Can highly recommend this tour! :)"

We could nearly hear the guide speaking over a poor quality microphone. Additionally, having had the bus break down we were not informed what to do next and had to guess (along with other customers). When we finally understood that we had the option to transfer to a bus behind or waiting, we decided to transfer. However, during this process the bus driver began to drive off, causing us and other customers to fall over. This happened at least twice and was pretty shocking. I could go on but to summarise, overall this lived up to the other bad reviews."

When we got back on the bus, there was nobody talking at all so it was nothing more than  just using a city bus to get around. We have used the hop on hop off bus in many major cities, and this was the worst."

However...we bought the 24 hour ticket thinking that this tour ran for 24 hours. Imagine our surprise when we left the CN Tower at 6:30pm and were waiting and waiting for the next bus. We called the company and were told that the last bus had left for the day. We had to take a taxi back to our car. We were also not informed that there was a 15 minute layover at the CN Tower."

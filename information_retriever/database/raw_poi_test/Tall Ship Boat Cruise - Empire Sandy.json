At 200 feet overall and 11,000 square feet of sail, the Tall Ship: Empire Sandy is Canada's largest passenger sailing ship. Sails are hoisted as the ship departs and the wind is harnessed to propel the 740 ton Empire Sandy along Toronto’s scenic waterfront. Wide expansive decks and spacious wood paneled lounges set the tone for a comfortable yet exhilarating experience.",

        "The huge line-up at the start should have given it away, but once on-board we were shocked to learn dining below was so cramped that it likely contravenes any safety and health regulations standards, never mind basic hospitality and decency. The soggy crackers did not qualify as hors d'oeuvre or appetizers, but rather as a warning for worse things to come. It was impossible to stay below the deck because the air quality due to the lack of ventilation was unhealthy. The ship never sailed, the two sails that were put up were for decor only - see photo below. Evidently, the concern for the cost of fuel must have taken us at most 2 km down and then back to port - this was NOT a cruise! Dinner on a small plates after waiting was 1 star, and the portion was child-size - when I requested a bit more, I was told \"you have to leave food for the other passangers\". Later on, the same happened with the dessert, an interminable line-up to get a thin slice of something supposed to be cheese cake, but I wouldn't call it food. People bundled close to the exit for the last hour, including us, anxious to escape the nightmare. After fighting our way to get off they even had audacity to ask for tips - really?

It was a blustery and cool day so it was good that the  Empire Sandy is a large vessel and there was hardly any motion.  My expectations with tour boat excursions are not high but I was very pleasantly surprised by this trip: the crew were friendly and professional; the food service included appetizers, buffet chicken lunch and a desert table, all good; the sailing experience was interesting and the views of Toronto were memorable.   There was also no shortage of beverages with both a deck bar as well as one in the dining room. ",

        "Went on a groupon coupon air show lunch cruise on Sept.2/17. Wow what a nice cruise. We started with excellent help boarding my elderly mother. Then were greeted with cheese, crackers and veggies. Plenty of appetisers for all. Then we set off around the Toronto Islands. Soon they passed around delicious shrimp with seafood sauce and then some cucumber, cheese and smoked salmon canapes.  Lunch was served and was very orderly and controlled with two buffet tables. They served rolls and four types of salad. Potato, Caesar, Spinach with strawberries and tossed. Then they had hot grilled veggies, rice and chicken breasts. All were served to your china plates by a friendly crew. Everything was delicious with exceptionally tender chicken. Dessert was served a little while latter. Fruit trays of fresh watermelon, cantaloupe, blueberries, pineapple and cherries. They had many cakes to choose from. We choose the cheesecake which was decadent. We cruised around the harbour enjoying the music and the air show at a distance. Then set off the cannon at the harbour front. Wow! We docked and once again we had excellent help disembarking my mother from the vessel. We were offered a sweet chocolate covered strawberry to finalise our journey. Wow! Worth every penny. A great experience with a caring crew dotting the i's and crossing the t's. Fantastic attention to details and attention to passengers needs."

My one and only complaint was we couldn't see the air show very well. Even with that I will definitely sail on the Empire Sandy again, and again, and again!"

        "We were part of a large group organized by the Retired teachers of ontario for a daylong cruise down the entire length of the Welland Canai from port Colbourn to Port Weller. We left dock about an hour late due mainly to higher priority traffic on the canal, after that everything was plain sailing. Al together there were about 150-180 aboard and the crew were totally amazing!  On boarding muffins, Danish, tea, coffee and water were avaiilable for all. Mid morning snacks of cheese, crackers and fruit plus veggies were offered. Lunch consisted of cold cuts, buns and assorted salads. Dinner consisted of very tender roast chicken, rice, pasta and Caesar salads and bread buns. Throughout the entire trip the crew were constantly bringing around ice water and glasses completely free of charge. In fact coffee, tea and water were constantly available and free for the entire trip. The crew were wonderful, friendly an polite for the entire trip.The DJ was absolutely fantastic, playing a great selection of music, dancing, singing for most of the trip.  I would/will definitely take this trip again!! ",

        "My wife pre-booked this trip as it looked like a really nice way to see Toronto from the harbour. And don't get me wrong, it was. But I am paraplegic and a full-time wheelchair user so its eligibility for a wheelchair user was put to them by my wife before she booked it. Is it definitely safe for my husband she asked on many an occasion. Their response was basically, hey, we do this on an everyday basis,nothing to worry about.OK. Great. Let's do it then. ",
        "Turning up on the day we noticed they actually have 2 different boats to sail on. A big boat holding 252 people and another that held 83. We were too late for the bigger boat so we had to board the smaller one. Now, initially,there was a fuss as to whether I could actually board the boat as the ramp onto it was at a 45 degree angle and I'm not the smallest man to push up that a type of incline. But they said they give it a go and it worked. Great.On board and ready to set sail.",
        "To start with I was placed in the middle of the boat with nothing to hold onto when two ladies behind me said they would move so I could rest next to the box they were sat on. Lovely. Then there was room for my wife as well and a nice place to view the harbour from. We set sail and for 20 minutes all was fine.Then the sails were released and the boat started to turn. Sharply. And to the right. Now this may have a nautical term, be it Starboard or Port but I scared as hell and I'm 'sure stop the boat!' is universal in any language. I didn't have my brakes on either (my fault) so I swung to the right and smashed straight into my wifes leg and the poor guy sat beside her. OK, I should have had my brakes on but come on, this was supposed to be wheelchair friendly! ",
        "The people on the boat all had a laugh and I suppose it was funny but then the guy doing the sails said the boat could actually tip so the sails are actually in the water. At this point I just wanted to get off. My poor wife had to hold onto my chair for the whole journey so I didn't tip again and luckily it didn't. But to claim it to be disabled friendly was beyond a joke.",
        "Leaving the boat the captain asked me if enjoyed it. Yes, apart nearly going overboard and hanging on with white knuckles it was great! Sarcasm doesn't travel over the Atlantic and he just slapped me on the shoulder and said 'well that's just swell!'.  ",
        "Seriously, it's a lovely ride if not a little bit dull but if you are a wheelchair user, try the bigger boat. I assure you it must be much safer than holding onto nothing and hoping the winds don't pick up for the 90 minutes you are on board. ",

We left at 11.30 so the lunch menu was adequate and what you would expect if you want to grab a quick bite to eat. Only criticism - the music. It's loud and awful. Surely part of the enjoyment of sailing is being able to hear the natural sounds around you and not have them drowned out by thumping recorded music - not even nautical music at that!"

        "Having lived in Toronto for 12 years and seen the gorgeous Empire Sandy parked at the foot of Spadina for years, it was a long-standing tourist dream come true for me to take a dinner cruise on my Canada Day birthday on the massive vessel. The ship is an absolute beauty above deck, the crew is fantastic and the overall experience was just superb. The captain is funny and it was lovely to see how the sails go up with young crew people working so hard to make it happen. They even set off their teeny cannon and it was quite the spectacle!",
        "However the food was beyond abysmal. I've done harbour cruises before so I knew it wasn't about the food, but this was even below my already low expectations. Apps were passed around but very limited and there were two dismal looking veggie platters set out on tables. The choices for dinner were limited to say the least. They only had ONE meat option - beef - which my partner does not eat. Sides were also limited and he had to fill up on salad and rolls. The salad literally tasted of rotten leaves. At least provide a chicken option? Note that a menu was not provided beforehand and we were not aware of what would be served even though the website mentions a buffet. ",
        "Below deck is quite a contrast to upstairs and the basic seating and stark look was a bit disappointing given it's a historical ship and more could be done to enhance the experience.",
        "Apart from the food it was magical. And honestly had there been no food at all, we'd have been fine - but the attempt made at \"dinner\" was a wet blanket on an otherwise stellar time."

        "It couldn't be a more perfect tall sail cruise on Toronto' Lake Ontario Waterfront.",
        "The weather was most ideal with just enough of a lake breeze to offer wind to a full set of sails. The ship and its crew were magnificent as was the finger foods passed on deck prior to a delicious buffet served just prior to sunset. The ship's DJ Ian entertained us with both commentary and fantastic mix of music. A great time was had by all!"

        "We have wanted to cruise on the Empire Sandy for a long time, and finally had our fabulous experience aboard this former tugboat. Beautiful ship, friendly and knowledgeable crew, delicious food and a glorious evening to spend on the water, admiring the Toronto islands and cityscape. Met passengers from around the province, many celebrating birthdays or anniversaries (as we were). The trip exceeded expectations, and luckily the weather was glorious. It gets cooler after sunset so bring along a light jacket or sweater. Food is served buffet style on deck, but there is cosy seating below deck if you prefer to eat at tables. It is magical to sail on this ship - highly recommended!"

        "The ship looks worn-out. Not enough sitting places on the deck. Most of people has to stay all 3.5 hours. It's not a real buffet, as servers count every peace you take. When rain started the food  wasn't removed from the tables on the deck and was served after for remaining customers in as is condition. Smoking is allowed on the deck crowded with small kids and senior people."

        "This was a private event 'Blues Cruise'.We set sail for a lunch cruise about 1pm.  The service and food were and  good, the lake and bay were calm. After snacking on cheese etc they came around with shrimp and smoked salmon canapes. I could see the chef busy in the galley  preparing lunch. It has been a long time since I actually enjoyed eating chicken and told him so when I complimented him.   Got a few ideas from him and they worked well  at home Thanks again Chef.  Cruising out into the lake and seeing the skyline behind the Island  greenery cuts out the ugly bits along the shore line  and adds to enjoying a day on the water."

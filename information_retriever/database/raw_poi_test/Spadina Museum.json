  "description": "The years between the two Great Wars, when Toronto experienced increased immigration, the vote for women, the stock market crash, prohibition and the introduction of public health and welfare. It's also the time of the Charleston craze, tabloid journalism, new technology and more. And it can all be seen, heard, felt and lived at Spadina Museum - Toronto's only museum to represent the 1920s and 30s, a transformative period that dramatically changed the City. For over a century, Spadina was home to three generations of the Austin family. Opened in 1984, it is one of 10 historic sites operated by the City of Toronto. Spadina Museum completed an extensive interior restoration in 2010, bringing the house back into the twentieth century. Visitors may view what the house looked like during those years through artifacts, furnishings and reproduced and original decor or explore the estate's six acres of restored 1905 gardens. Today, Spadina Museum interprets the interwar period through a rich slate of guided tours, school programs, special events, changing exhibits, lectures and workshops. Spadina Museum is one of 10 historic museums operated by the City of Toronto. Toronto's Historic Sites engage visitors, inspire passion, challenge ideas and connect the past to the present.",

        "Spadina House is a fascinating part of Toronto history. But if you want to see the house, you’ll have to take the tour. It’s compulsory. Yet the tour is largely irrelevant. So, if you want to learn about the house’s owners, or the social life of Toronto’s elites back then, you will be disappointed. Those topics are barely discussed.",
        "Instead, on my visit at least, the tour focused on the oppression that prevailed in the American South, prior to the Civil War. Even the Underground Railway was discussed! But why? Those topics had little relevance to Spadina House, which is located in Canada, not in the Deep South! Moreover, the American Civil War ended one year before this house was even built.",
        "The tour was presented from the perspective of a female servant who was employed in the house. I felt sad to hear how she was separated from her Deep South relatives. But her story was only tangentially related to the house that I had come to see. Surely the owners’ lives were interesting too, yet we were not told much about them. ",
        "One thing I did learn was that the owner of the house founded several successful Canadian banks. He must have been very clever and skillful. In contrast, the female servant likely had no such skill, yet the tour questioned why it was not she who owned the house, rather than the bank founder. In short, the theme of the tour was unfairness – in the context of some irrelevant American history. ",
        "Overall, the tour narrative was heavily influenced by critical race theory. The effect was like rubbing salt on old wounds. Historian Christopher Rufo would describe this as part of a woke Maoist movement to incite resentment and divide our society, and that does seem plausible.",
        "Should you visit Spadina House? Only if you can tolerate the mandatory neo-Marxist agitprop. Otherwise, if you are hoping for a balanced and relevant presentation of some Toronto history, the Spadina House Museum will leave you disappointed."

My sister in law and I arrived around 1130am, toured the lovely garden and orchard, munched an apple each, and chatted about varieties with their friendly gardeners. You need to see the House via guided tour, so we planned to come back for 115pm, after Jamaican food and ice cream near St Clair and Vaughan. On our return, the tour starts in the basement with a great video about Toronto in the 1910’s and 1920’s, and pronunciation - Spa-die-nah vs Spa-dee-nah vs Spahh-dee-nahhhh. Upstairs, you are led through a dozen rooms - a palm room, a games room, a kitchen, dining room, bathroom, bedrooms, a telephone room. It’s so informative, and it’s free."

Took public transportation from city centre and walked from subway to venues.  Casa Loma was huge disappointment, only stayed long enough to grab a quick lunch.  Walked to Spadina House and were amazed!  It is lovely!  Beautiful gardens, relaxing grounds, friendly staff, no lines, and FREE!   Took a fabulous tour with a young guide, Tiber, who was fantastic!  Lots of interesting interior to see and information about about the region at the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th centuries.  This is a must see in Toronto.  "

Our visit started in the basement, with a short but very informative film about the mansion and the time period it was built in. Our tour guide, Kathy, was a veritable font of information and delightful tidbits about the Austins, who owned this beautiful home/mansion from 1866 to 1982. Just as well we had a tour guide, how else would we know the trapdoor in the conservatory floor provided access for the gardener without him tramping through the house? Our guide's anecdotes really brought the former occupants to life. There are many stairs to climb but a lift is available for anyone needing assistance and the staff were very helpful. The washrooms, which are in the basement, are also accessible After the house tour, we visited the gardens at our leisure.

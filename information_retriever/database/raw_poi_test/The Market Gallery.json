The Gallery itself is just one large room, containing exhibits about the development of brewing beer and ale in southern Ontario. Access is by elevator near the main doors. There are public washrooms in the basement."

        "This quiet, little-known Museum over the bustling St. Lawrence Market is either a Quinn quick in-and-out or a spot for serious contemplation, depending on what’s on. The current show on Toronto through the eyes of women artists is the best I’ve seen there. Although the 19th-century artists are of mostly historical interest, the works get increasingly powerful as the show’s arc bends toward the present. I’ll be returning for a longer look at pieces I particularly liked, most by artists new to me. Don’t miss the 27-minute doc on Russian-born Paraskeva Clark, who at 81 was colourful, quotable and subversively charming."

        "Last Saturday the Market Gallery offered free admission to their show of women painters and their depictions of Toronto, from the late 19th century to the recent past. The works are a selection from those held by the City of Toronto. I was particularly pleased to see works by Paraskeva Clark and Doris McCarthy, but there are many other very good pieces. This show should not be missed. It runs into April."

MAKE SURE you go to the bank and do the exchange. There are MANY good places to sample food and other goods from the local area. Take your time and try the poutine (just a hint) don't forget dessert.

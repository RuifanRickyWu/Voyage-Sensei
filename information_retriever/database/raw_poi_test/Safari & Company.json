He advised three different camps in Botswana (2) and Zambia (1) which gave diffenent experiences and where a great combination. This is my 3rd safari and although nothing can compete with the first experience (also organized by Mike) and every day is different with something new from wild dog, lions  walking through the delta, lions and leopards up trees.,"

The safari experience at two lodges in Kruger and other activities in Cape Town and the wine country exceeded all our expectations and everything was professionally executed.  In short we had a wonderful time.  Hotels selected and activities recommended were toally awesome."

        "I am sure I will sound like Mike Haine's mother as this review will be so glowing!!!  Every word here is the truth.  Mike put together a trip so flawless, so perfectly executed, so exactly what we asked for.  I can't say enough, communicate enough appreciation for him.  Not a single screw up or problem over a month's time.  Prior to the start of a trip, I find the real professionals rise - or FALL to the occasion.  This is always their litmus test as far as I am concerned, but by then it might be too late - they have your money.  NOT with Safari and Co.  The company and Mike Haines return your  calls promptly, return emails and texts, answer all issues, (I was not as computer literate as many of his guests are I'm sure!) but he was right there - every step of the way.  His gentle nudges to remind me to do something prior to the trip were always helpful. I don't want to sound as if I am bragging, believe me when I say this, but I have traveled all over the world and this trip was one of our TOP THREE.  Mike and his team offer the total experience, plying you with packing suggestions, descriptions of your lodging, truths about the culture, the food, overviews of the city, the entire package.  I was so well versed as to what I needed I lacked for nothing on this trip - and we were gone for one month.  Africa for a month was a dream come true, although this was not our first African trip.  But it was our first with Michael after he was referred by good friends currently on their 8th trip with him.  NOW THAT IS A TRUE RECOMMENDATION.  Many agents say they \"know Africa,\" but few live Africa as Mike does, checking the lodges he books, keeping up with new places and rechecking places he refers his guests to.  He is African and knows the continent well.  You can not go wrong with this company.  See, I told you this review was glowing - and I meant every sentence!!!   If Africa is on YOUR bucket list, this is the man to call."

        "What an adventure we experienced thank you to Michael Haines! We started in Capetown for four nights, then flew to northern South Africa for a six night safari. From here we flew to Windhoek, Namibia to continue our adventure at Camp Sossus and the famous sand dunes, back to Windhoek, and finally ended in Zimbabwe to experience Victoria Falls. Every aspect of this adventure was as predicted, over the top amazing! The tour guides were so friendly and knowledgable. The food was outstanding! The accommodations were 5 star! We have nothing but very positive comments to say about our trip and the planning details that Michael arranged for us. We look forward to our next adventure with Safari and Company. Thank you again Michael for your attention to detail from all aspects of this trip! We thoroughly enjoyed every minute of it! Sandy and Barry."

From the minute I contacted Mike he was professional, friendly, helpful and provided all of the information, details and costs for the various Safaris. He helped with all of the planning and provided a comprehensive itinerary for our 18 day trip to South Africa, Zambia and Botswana. Everything was very well organized and all of the pick ups, flights and accommodations were exactly as planned and presented as per the itinerary. I was extremely impressed with the level of planning and the whole trip was awesome and amazing thanks to Mike and Safari and Company. I have no hesitation recommending Mike for your next trip plans."

Every detail was taken care of. I was met on arrival at each destination, got assistance with my bags and taken to the next step. I was booked into a variety of camps to get the full experience. all my dietary needs were met. At one camp a fully charged battery was in my room when i arrived for the CPAP machine because that camp ran on a generator. I went to 4 countries, 3 of which was for safari and Victoria Falls. I had all the visas and paper work as per Michael's instructions, all of which made immigrations, that much easier. Last but not least, he walked me through getting an app on my phone that had my day to day itinerary with notes for each day."

Mike Haines did just as well this time in orchestrating our trip. It was so simple for us... with not a glitch in transfers, accommodation, flights etc. The itinerary app was the best. The camps and hotels were excellent and so fitting to each location, food delicious, and I don't think anywhere else makes you feel as welcome.  Oh, and all the wonderful animals!!! The excellent guides who drove us seemed to know just where the animals would be...zebra, giraffe, lions, leopard, cheeta, hippopotamus, baboon, ostrich even a rhino in the distance. We do travel as much as possible, and Safari & Co has been our benchmark. No other independant travel provider has been better, but this time they may just have surpassed themselves!"

We spent a week in Tanzania staying at lodges and tent camps, then spent 2 days at Victoria Falls in Zambia, followed by another 5 days in Botswana at safari tent camps. All parts of the trip were well coordinated by Safari & Co, with friendly, personable, and knowledgeable guides at every stop along the way.

I have spent a lot of time in Africa and have been all over the continent going the solo budget backpacker route. Being older and with my family I needed something a bit more \"upscale\". One thing you worry about going this route is a loss of authenticity but I can assure you this was not a problem. If you are worried about the package tours where you get off a bus with 40 others for a quick photo in front of some landmark you need not worry. Mike provides the real deal."

        "Amazing Trip. We contacted Michael at Safari and Co and asked him to put together a trip to South Africa where we would be able to see all of the animals, but with a preference for big cats. He put a proposal together for three private reserves as we didn’t want one where 40 vehicles all show up at the same time and you can’t see much. He recommended MalaMala (located within Krueger but a private, separate reserve) and then two reserves in Botswana (Kwando Lagoon and Kwara). These were all amazing. A max of two or three vehicles allowed at one sighting so plenty of opportunity to get amazing photos and up close sightings (my wife got more than 6000 photos - we have a LOT to go through - lol). Incredible sighting of lion prides with 8 small cubs, leopard sightings including one female who took her Impala kill up a tree to secure it from other predators (right in front of us), two male cheetahs with a zebra kill and so much more. We saw the big 5 all in one day at MalaMala. The accommodations were beyond impressive. There are so many things I could put down here but you have to see it to believe it. A must do on anyones bucket list. My wife travelled to Africa 5 yrs ago with our daughter and Michael arranged the trip for them. That is why we went back to him for this trip, and we will definitely be going back again with Michael’s expertise helping to plan the next trip. "

An amazing tented experience with breakfast and lunch in the bush.

        "This was the most rewarding fishing charter we have ever experienced. We have previously chartered in Haida G'waii and Vancouver.",
        "My husband found Ryan's webpage online, and after some comparison shopping, he chose We Pound Em Sportsfishing. Ryan was easy to communicate with and gave us all the information we needed.",
        "We chose the early morning (5 am) departure time, as the days were getting to 32C or more. Ryan was ready for us and we left promptly. He took us out around 4 miles from the marina, so we had a fantastic view of the sun coming up, igniting the downtown skyline in a firey red through the light fog.",
        "By 10:30 am, we had caught 5 enormous chinook salmon (18 to 23lb each)  and 2 smaller coho. As Ryan began to clean our catch onboard, we were still catching more. It was incredible. The fish we caught amounted to around 80 lbs of cleaned fish.",
        "The 38' Trojan diesel-powered vessel had a 14' wide beam, so we didn't feel crowded at all. Even while the two of us were fighting to land a huge king salmon at once, Ryan had ample room to work his nets between us. The private head in the cabin added to our comfort.",
        "We would definitely recommend this business and will fish with Ryan again when our freezer is empty!"

It was active early on with a lull a litttle later, too hot so we were slow in setting the hook. Then it went crazy and we fished hard until the end of the day. Ryan cleaned and bagged our catch, which amounted to 80+ lbs cleaned coho and pacific salmon. ",
        "Nice big boat running on diesel, no issues with fumes though. Ryan kept the boat nicely cleaned and organized during the charter and I liked the fact he gave a gaff to my wife to hold her catches for pics.",

The trip was a gift for my father and father-in-law and turned out to be a lifetime experience for them.  You literally do not have to have any fishing experience, Ryan takes care of everything!  You get to sit back and relax and then enjoy the fight when a fish bites on with Ryan there to guide you through it. We caught and kept TWO 21 pound King Salmon and a 10 pound Coho Salmon! Realistically it's fishing, he can't guarantee you are going to have a day like we did, but he will do everything he can to make that possible!"

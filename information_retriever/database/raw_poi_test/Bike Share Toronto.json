  "description": "Bike Share Toronto has grown to become one of Toronto’s integral transportation systems to help people move around the city. Using more than 627 KM of bike lanes across the city, you can see and visit from every angle and at your own pace. As of 2020, you can take advantage of more than 625 stations, 6,500 bikes and even utilize our newly introduced e-bikes that can help you move around every day! p.s - Don't forget to bring a helmet. With our popular 24-hour access pass, you’ll gain access to our system to explore as you please. Be sure to avoid our $4 per half hour overage fees by docking the bike every 30 minutes or less to reset your trip timer. *Trip under 30 minutes = No Overage fee *Trip 31-60 minutes = $4 Overage fee *See website for more* All of our passes, information and an interactive map of the system can be found on our app, PBSC or the Transit App. Both are available on the iTunes or Google Play app stores! Have any questions? Call or email us, we're open 24/7.",

The bike is 3 speeds yet it went twice as slow as my regular bike. $8 one way for 8km!! Also to get the seat high enough to be comfortable made it hard to reach my foot to the ground when stopping, an unsafe design. Surely we can do better. My ride was expensive uncomfortable and slow. Awful."

There is no liability from this company and zero way that we can find to resolve the problem. Never using again."

Buyer beware, they will market this as a 30-minute all day pass, but no docking station will recognize or honour your initial purchase for an all day pass and you will be forced to purchase a brand new pass each time you dock your bike. 15 minutes after my initial purchase, I docked my bike and was ready to get another bike (to stay within the 30 minute ride maximum). Unfortunately, the screen didn't work and I was forced to download the app. The app did not provide an option for those who already purchased an all-day pass. The only option was to purchase ANOTHER pass. When I got to the third docking station (again 15 mins later), the screen had an option \"I have a pass\" but when I clicked this option it said \"Please insert identification card or key.\" Not sure what this meant, but I attempted to insert my receipt with my previous code on it, nothing happened. Attempted to call customer service but it said \"we are unable to take your call at this time\" so I assumed they were closed for the weekend. Ended up with $100 worth of charges to my credit card. I called on Monday and had to explain myself 7 times (the rep did not understand the issue) and they refused to refund charges. They also said \"if you had a problem you should have called.\" When I mentioned that I attempted to call and after several minutes on hold was told my call could not be answered, they snapped back saying \"we were open so that's not possible.\" This company should be shut down for false advertising."

I think they disconnected all the credit card readers and you have to download the app. I tried the 2 apps they listed, Bike share Toronto and Cycle Finder. I could not get either to work.  In other cities I have been able to navigate the bike rentals no problem. It just seems the Toronto one is really bad. I do see people using rental bikes in Toronto. I wonder if they have had the same issues."

        "Used the bike with my daughter early September for first time. It was supposed to be a fun ride along the Harbourfront but it was a terrible experience having to constantly look out for the next bike station to dock and keeping time limit of no more than 30 mins. It was a stressful and unpleasant bike ride . The bike seat was most uncomfortable and hurting. Was additionally charged for exceeding 2 mins for one the ride. Will not use this shared bike service ever again and definitely not recommend to anybody."

        "Awful experience using bike share. Purchased the 24HR pass but after about an hour and a half of riding, the app no longer let me unlock bikes, citing \"oops not working now\" as the error. I tried all methods of unlocking the bike to no avail. This left me stranded a 4+ hour walk from my apartment and I had to hail a cab to get home. I would not recommend this service to anyone and will no longer be using it."

The app was reliable for telling us if a station was full or had spots which is a must for planning your route.  ",
        "Only complaints would be racks in some places are always full when we checked so we couldn't plan them in our route and I think Bike Share Toronto needs to consider always keeping at least one station free somehow."

Although clean and modern, there was no luxury vehicle. When I contacted the company, I was told it was a seasonal experience. This was never told to me in advance. The description I‚Äôm Trip Advisor and my confirmation described a totally different experience. The photos in the confirmation are of people in the Ice Bar! It is unfortunate that this misrepresentation occurred. I would NOT recommend booking with this company!"

We went to Inniskillen, Reif, Lailey and Fielding Estates - and the 3 course lunch was in a fantastic spot with amazing wood fire oven thin crust pizza. The chocolate desert wasn't too bad either! ;)",

He made to sure find out what breweries we had seen already (not just on the last tour but even through our own tastings) and he arranged a customized tour so that we would get to experience a whole new set of breweries. Both Jim and Bill are great tour guides with genuine, classic customer service and a desire to please. I would recommend this tour to anyone who enjoys a few brews. The breweries all make sure you aren't thirsty and Jim and Bill make sure you get to the next one on time....teamwork at its best!!"

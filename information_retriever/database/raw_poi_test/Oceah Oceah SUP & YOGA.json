        "If you are visiting Toronto during the summer, I strongly recommend that you go paddle boarding with Osha osha! I am an marginally fit American visiting from New York City for the Canada Day weekend and I‚Äôve spent two of my five scheduled days there, it‚Äôs that good ‚ù§Ô∏è",
        "I was nervous about SUP when my friend who is a local recommended we paddle on Canada Day. I‚Äôve only done SUP one time before and I couldn‚Äôt even stand on the board, but my friend told me Jen and her company Osha osha would change how I feel about it. We did the Humber river tour and it started with an orientation on how to use paddles and boards and once we got into the water, how steer,  sit and stand (!) on the board. When I couldn‚Äôt stand the last time, this time I felts confident and prepared enough by Osha osha. I padded,  staring out towards the horizon, feeling free and strong. I spent most of those first couple of hours sitting, however and that was wonderful too. ",
        "It felt so good physically and mentally, that we rented boards the next day and went out during sunset! Gorgeous views and the water was calm!",
        "Not going to lie: a couple of times I started feeling anxious and wanted to turn around because of how far we were going during the tour. I didn‚Äôt realize I had it in me to do this 2+ hour tour and Jen‚Äôs patience and confidence building support calmed me down and I was able to push myself ",
        "Osha osha provided an amazingly fun and safe way to enjoy Toronto‚Äôs waterways. The lake was a beautiful, serene, clean and COOL on the 94F/33C degree days. Although I‚Äôve visited before Toronto in the summer before, I‚Äôm sorry that I never got to enjoy connecting with the water until now.",
        "Beyond the excellent board and paddle selection, convenient Western beach location to Downtown and calm waters, Jen‚Äôs care, consideration and instruction really make Osha osha a great business to support if you want SUP. I highly recommend!"

She showed great knowledge and expertise on the technical aspects of Paddleboarding as well as the more health/spiritual benefits that the activity brings. Her equipment was all top notch and in really good shape. Her prices are very competitive for this type of service. Finally, the location at the west Toronto lakeshore is ideal because the barricades calm the waves, making for a smooth serene boarding experience. Thanks Jen!"

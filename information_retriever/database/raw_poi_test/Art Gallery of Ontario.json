I went to the Making Her Mark exhibit, which I thought was very well done and addressed different learning styles and sensory experiences, i.e. it wasn't just looking at art, they also had period appropriate music, scent boxes, and touchable items. The artworks themselves were very interesting but it is a temporary exhibition. The other galleries were more traditional in approach and felt more 'museum-like'. The Canadian artists galleries were a lot of paintings by the same set of artists, but were interesting since the color palette reminded me a lot of Scandinavian artists such as Munch. I didn't have a lot of time to explore the permanent galleries but from what I did see, the exhibits look well thought out with an eye towards inclusion and represenation.

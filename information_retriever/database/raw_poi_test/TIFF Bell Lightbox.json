        "I just wish I had gone when I was younger, but then I would not have been able to afford it.  We flew in from the US.  I have wanted to go to TIFF for 10 years.  Finally, just said, let's go.  Had to review summaries of lots of movies before deciding which tickets to buy.  Bought a diverse group of movies (including one series of shorts).  We did good with our choices.  The best part was hearing from the producers, starts, screen writers, etc. before and after the movies.  And it was great to see Toronto, we had a wonderful time.  I say it would be better to go when younger, because I am 60 now and while still very mobile, I hate standing in lines and waiting, and we did that for all 10 movies we saw.  Very long lines as people come earlier so they can get good seats (all our theaters but one were general admission), and so they can get close to the movie stars.  Also after one movie is done you had to race to another theater and sometimes use a cab.  We got a hotel in the middle of the theaters, but that is downtown and expensive.  Could have probably gotten a cheaper hotel, but I wanted something nice, but still paid a lot. Still as I say I am glad I went, very glad to see Toronto, glad for the experience, but probably a once in a lifetime thing. Still I sat by a lady a lot older than me that was staying the whole 10 days and was seeing 47 movies.  Toronto felt safe and TIFF had a nice store and around the TIFF building were lots of interesting experiences and red carpet areas. "

        "I came here on a Thursday afternoon after eating at Banh Mi Boyz nearby. I parked on Camden Street and had to pay $6 for parking. I came to watch God’s Own Country. While studying in Detroit, I kept asking the distributor and official social media accounts of the film to bring the film to Detroit, but to no avail. But then, I remembered that I was gonna go home to Oakville for the US Thanksgiving break & could watch God’s Own Country at the TIFF Bell Lightbox in Toronto! I was so elated at this revelation! It was about 45 minutes to get to Toronto as there was traffic. Finding parking was a pain as I watched to park for free but relented and paid for it. I came on the last day the theater was showing the film. Students get a discount! The box office was on the first floor right up front. The various theaters are upstairs. My Theater was Theater 5 and was on the third floor. I was surprised at how small the auditorium was as this venue is a part of the annual Toronto Film Festival. The chairs were comfortable and the temperature was nice (not too cold and not too warm). The picture and sound quality were good too! The movie was very good! Although the heavy British accents made it hard for me to decipher some of the words being spoken (interesting that I found the Romanian’s English to be more understandable than the British’s), the movie was touching & engaging! Not as good as Call Me By Your Name or Brokeback Mountain, but still good and worth the long drive and parking pain. Hopefully, the next time I come here, it will be during the Toronto International Film Festival! "

The theaters are large and well - maintained. Glad commercial advertising hasn't crept in here before the film, but also feel they could use the space for better self-promotion. Concession stand could be improved. Pepsi products . . .blecch! when I asked about whether there were \"combo\" option with drink and popcorn it elicited a snarky expression of the person who was taking his job too seriously. My only other negative is the welcoming helpful Canadian attitude found elsewhere wasn't terribly evident here."

Well I am movie reviewer in IMDB since 2015 thats why my very first list in Toronto was going to TIFF Bell Lightbox Building. One month before I ask permission on the email for this free visit and the staffs welcome me in very nice gesture and words. TIFF is my home. I visited TIFF twice, in the night where I have dinner in TIFF Canteen and in the morning on my way before watching Hailee Steinfeld concert in Budweiser Stage. TIFF is both beautiful and iconic both in the night or daylight. But because I was alone so I have to ask other people to take photos of me. Many ways I do selfie but this is TIFF and I want to look beautiful. In TIFF Canteen there are several choices and I ate the Burger grill with price 40 CAD including drink, that is the most popular dish. French fries are so large so I could took them away to home. I want to comeback again to TIFF one day as an invited person in film industry. Amen!!"

Lots of lovely staff eager to demonstrate or help us get the most from areas like the Green Screen. It might be less enjoyable if we had to wait in lines, and sound-based activities would not work as well if there's a noisy crowd.

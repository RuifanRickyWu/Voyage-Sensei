  "description": "These private photography sessions take the chore (and mistakes) out of documenting your visit to Toronto. With a professional photographer dedicated to capturing your every camera-ready move, you'll enjoy each moment instead of scrambling for the photo. You might...maybe...miss asking strangers to take your photo or those charming pictures of your arm with half of an overexposed face. With this experience, you'll get 50 fully-edited digital photos - plenty of perfection for posting, framing and subtly bragging out. Be snapped at famous landmarks, get couple-time that you'll remember, re-enact your favourite sports moments, or step back into Toronto's past.",

Really enjoyed the experience and definitely recommend you try it yourselves!"

Dustin also tailored the tour to our interests (as well as our timing) and then followed up with additional ideas for the rest of our stay.  Would highly recommend this tour!"

He was knowledgeable of history, art, and architecture, and kept up a steady stride on this very cold winter day.  When my fingers started to get frostbitten, he knew just which building to stop in for a quick warm up.  He was prompt and sociable and I couldn't have wished for a better introduction to UofT and nearby history.  He walked me to my next stop on my visit,  followed the tour up with email assistance for the rest of my trip, and sent a dropbox album of photos.  I would be happy to recommend LiveToronto."

Dustin was a phenomenal guide and seemed genuinely interested in sharing his knowledge of the city.  He was also easy-going and wanted the tour to meet my needs and ensured he showed me landmarks I'd be interested in.  He was super friendly.  I mentioned I had left my ticket to a ball game at the hotel and he found a way for me to print it out so I wouldn't have to go back without me even asking him to do so.  In addition, he sent me links of information and discounts to the attractions I told him I was going to see.  This tour is definitely worth and the time and investment!"

And yet I had no idea how much more the tour would be. Dustin customized the tour for sites that I would appreciate. It is the home of hockey so that was a focus along with historic buildings. Dustin's passion for the city of Toronto (and hockey) came through at every stop. This is a must-do tour for those who want to learn more about the city than the guidebooks tell you. Also a great idea for those who might want to commemorate a special occasion. The photos Dustin took were amazing."

He met us at our hotel and was obviously very passionate and knowledgeable about tourists having a great time in his city- even pointing out some local events & tons of discounts/tickets that were available.  It was really great to have somebody else taking some nice & very scenic photos of our family while we were there.  THANKS DUSTIN!"

I would recommend this tour for anyone, especially those who think they know a lot about the wonderful city called Toronto. Not only will you get some amazing pictures, but you will learn a lot about this wonderful city. You will also get an amazing tour guide in the process. Thanks Dustin and keep up the good work.

We had never been on any type of tour before -  in fact I wasn't even sure if I could convince my husband to go as it would not be something he would normally choose to do.  Upon meeting Dustin I knew that it was going to be fun, it didn't feel awkward as I first thought it might and his knowledge and passion about the area shone through. He showed us parts of the city we would probably never have visited on our own and pointed out interesting facts about buildings which we would never have known. To top it all off, our photos turned out AMAZING! We had them within an hour or so of the tour ending - we got to enjoy looking at them as we had dinner at the CN Tower! ",

        "My fiance and I live/work in Toronto and took the Date Night tour with Dustin (owner and tour guide) a few weekends ago. We loved every bit of it! We used to be one of those people who would say \"Toronto sucks, there's nothing to do here\". But this tour really opened up our eyes and taught us that there is so much to discover if you just slow down and take the time to soak in what life has to offer! This is a great (and affordable!) activity for both locals and tourists. It is a definite recommendation for couples or friends who want to do something different than the usual eating out, shopping or movie. It's a must for tourists - I wish I had known this company existed before as I always have relatives visit from the states (definitely on the itinerary next time). ",
        "The concept is brilliant as the tours are private and cater to your interests. Dustin is very knowledgeable and has really done his research as he has a number of different tours in his back pocket. And because of that, we can look forward to taking tours with LiveToronto again! He also has different TYPES of tours you can check out on their website other than the Date Night (ex: Social Network tour). He will show you \"hidden gems\" in Toronto that people wouldn't take the time to notice and would just usually walk by. You don't have to worry about holding back a whole tour group to ask anything and Dustin carried out great conversation the whole way through. He also took pictures of us at each location we passed through, which was awesome as it can be difficult to constantly ask random people to take your picture. Dustin also takes great scenic pictures of the different landmarks at each tour stop. Every time I asked him if he took a picture of a particular thing, he'd already beat me to it! The camera Dustin used produced great quality pictures that we definitely uploaded to Facebook and are actually going to use them in our engagement photo slideshow! We learned so many different things about the city we've lived/worked in all our lives and can't wait to book a different tour next time!"

He had interesting things to point out at every corner and sweet spots for taking the photos. We were amazed how quickly time passed.

We have never done anything, and the concept is really so cool.  Toronto is a doorstep away really, but I haven't seen much of it to be honest.  So for me, this was an occasion to take in a city that for me before was too big, had too many people, and many more too's.  ",

We laughed and were silly at times, and it was all captured by the skill Dustin has with his camera.  ",

We finished along the waterfront and then went into a shopping centre where he found some leaflets and went through different things for me to do during the rest of my stay which I really appreciated! Overall the tour lasted half an hour longer than I expected which was an added bonus. I got the email with a link to my photos the next day and they really are great! There were all the photos of myself and then lots of various sights around the city too. This was a great way to see the city from a different perspective and not like the usual touristy tours. Plus there was no single person supplement so was a good bargain especially for all the photos! Would definitely recommend this to anyone!"

        "My partner and I booked a walking tour of Old Toronto and the St. Lawrence Market area using our Samba Days package.  This was an area that was fairly new to us and we had a great time discovering this part of Toronto.  We started at Osgood hall near the old and new City Halls and finished off at St. Lawrence Market.  Dustin was a fantastic tour guide; he was informative and entertaining.  The cool part was getting a set of photos taken of us along the way.  It was a photos hoot and tour all rolled into one.  ",
        "We would definitely consider booking another tour!",
        "FYI there is a bit of walking, but it's worth it!"

        "Our date night tour was awesome!! We had beautiful weather and a cool tour guide and photographer rolled up in one!! We were amazed by Dustin's photography talent, attention to detail, and likeable personality. He' was very knowledgable about Toronto's historical sites, entertainment locations, and scenic locations. We learned and saw a lot of fascinating venues, historical places, and took some beautiful memorable photos. The walk was pleasant, and we enjoyed the great interactive conversation and laid back atmosphere he created. An hour went by quickly, but it was so fun! He made us feel very comfortable.  We would highly recommend this date night tour to all of our friends. It was a sweet little date with fantastic quality photos included.  Thanks so much and Blessings in all you do Dustin!!! D&S xo"

Dustin is a fantastic tour guide and really fun to be around (and easy to get along with) The photos were not cliche, but unique and customized to our preferences. I would consider even doing this again. Thank you!"

        "Do you never think to take photos of you and your significant other when you are out on the town and looking good? Are all your photos together poorly composed and boring because they are taken by a friend or random passer by? Do your photos together have that distinct \"selfie\" look with strange expressions and hunched up body angles to try to disguise the fact that one of you is holding the phone? ",
        "If so, then you need LiveToronto and Dustin! His 15000 photos, hundreds of hours and kilometers of experience mean you get great photos with cool backdrops all over this great city. Did I mention you also get a fun and interesting tour that caters to your particular interests? You will wonder where the time went as you are entertained, informed, gently papparazzi'd and then left feeling the glow or warm attention and good times. Awesome photos follow in the days to come to allow you to re-live the experience and revel in your collective beauty!",

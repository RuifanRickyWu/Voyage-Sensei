        "We were so excited to watch the Taylor Swift Eras Concert at this theatre. We paid 1/3 more just to see it at this theatre and pre-purchased our tickets well in advance. Management LEFT THE LIGHTS FULLY ON for the entire first hour of the film as they wanted to \"extend their food and beverage service\". ",
        "So for the first solid hour of the concert. the images on the screen were not even clear, and not vibrant at all due to the overhead lights being on. ",
        "It was filmed to be an immersive experience so that people would feel like they were actually at the concert too. It was impossible to engage with the concert in any meaningful way (much less \"immersively\") in a FULLY LIT ROOM with people and food coming and going constantly. Waitstaff were literally standing right in front of my seat talking loudly, taking extended orders and delivering food and drinks. All the while wearing so much perfume and cologne that it was making us nauseous and ill.",
        "The manager refused to turn the lights off even when asked and was himself wearing such a ghastly amount of cologne that he made us dizzy for ages whenever he walked by.",
        "Over an hour into the concert the lights were finally blissfully turned off and we could actually see the film properly for the first time. And it was gorgeous! ",
        "Unfortunately once we could see the screen properly, it became clear that the sync between audio and video was not right so Taylor's mouth never really matched the words she was singing. Which was disappointing/distracting, but of smaller consequence compared to the lights being left on.",
        "So our $30 per ticket choice to attend this premium-priced event at the Don Mills Cineplex VIP also cost us the chance to properly enjoy what we had paid for and had been so excited to see. We could have saved $10 per ticket and would have enjoyed it *so much more* in a DARK, regularly priced theatre. Where we could see the whole film in the way it was intended to be seen.",
        "Everyone we spoke with from the audience afterwards were also very annoyed by the lights being left on for so long. It really killed the whole vibe of the event/evening.",
        "If they are doing this for all of their movies they will not continue to exist for very long. It was my favourite theatre until tonight. Now I won't be going back. And I still have to buy another ticket to properly see the first hour of the concert somewhere else."

        "This is one of my favourite Toronto VIP theatres. They only have VIP choices. Seating is excellent reclining big oversized chairs, lots of space between your neighbours, etc. Screens are a good size. There is an elevator and unisex private washroom stalls. Our food order was taken fast but food was a bit slow and my fries were super cold. We ordered 12 chicken tenders and only got 6. They brought us hot fries and extra chicken tenders when we let staff know. Staff were really nice and tried hard to fix the mistakes. We saw Western Star Bruce Springsteen did a lot of sharing, music was amazing lots of strings! We enjoyed it."

So we went to the late evening show in Cineplex VIP Don Mills. The atmosphere was great - so relaxing! And the seats were very comfortable. Later my husband told me that their menu had just few types of tap beer and food choice was not large, but the apple based desert I had was really good. ",

They tasted so fresh, same with the scrumptious Caesar salad that came with the Jalapeño Burger my husband ate. I had the tasty  fish and chips which were delightfully crunchy.  My sister-in-law joined us later and agreed the calamaris were one of the best we've ever tasted. Although, she didn't enjoy her ceviche appetizer.  I was happy to take my unfinished Chardonnay to the movie theatre and enjoyed drinking it at my leisure. Overall a great relaxing experience for all of us.  Will come back again."

You arrive to nice comfortable reclining leather seats with tabletops and menus (including items not available at normal Cineplex's and alcohol). Servers will take your order and deliver your food and drinks before the movie. It is a nice little treat for couples or friends to enjoy a movie together while grabbing dinner at the same time. ",

We paid almost $50 in food and half way through the movie, still no food delivered. My boyfriend had to leave the theatre and miss part of the movie, to ask them where our food was to be told they didn't even made it and the order must have been lost. We eventually got our food and it was good; but it is just unfortunate that for a \"VIP experience\" they forget peoples orders. We were one of three other couples they forgot the orders for. If they were a bit more organized, they'd get a full 5/5 from me. ",

They have a fully stocked bar with several beers on tap as well as a nice selection of wines.  As well as getting Scene points for the movie, I got more points for eating there.  What I didn't realize that once I got into the cinema showing the film I could order from the servers there a full meal along with wine, beer, soft drink, etc.  The seats are leather recliners with a table that swings around and holder for wine, pop, etc.  Great experience and will do it again.  Pricier than regular theatre pricing but well worth it.  No one under the age of 19 aloud in the place."

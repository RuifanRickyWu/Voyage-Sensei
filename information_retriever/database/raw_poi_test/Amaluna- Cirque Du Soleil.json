        "We bought tickets early for Kooza and were glad we did. Prices quadrupled in a month. The show was good for younger ones; the clowns entertained kids. The Asian acrobatics amazed audiences, and the singing reminded me of Dune. Little ones might not want to sit up front due to scary skeleton figures and devils, who performed powerfully on giant roller balls. The tightrope act was good and so was the chairs act. Arriving early is a good idea; parking at the gravel/dirt entrance was pricy ($35-40) but luckily, at Humber Park by Lake Ontario, it was cheaper. The washrooms were port-a-potties with limited refreshments besides, so using facilities before arriving and carrying water bottles was a good idea. Our doors (5-7) at 2150 Lakeshore Boulevard were a further walk toward the rear with stairs; doors 1-3 are better for easier accessible admission near centre-stage and with less crowding at the end. With few benches near security, we found seating under the tent an hour before the show. Thankfully, because of the rush, we booked in advance at a restaurant on the Queensway. Kooza in the afternoon was a fun outing, and the best part was its location close to home!"

The choreography was out of this world and every single one of the performing artists did their job flawlessly and with amazing accuracy! Cirque Du Soleil Is definitely worth a visit and one who has an appreciation of the performing arts will not be disappointed."

        "Booked a show for clients over a month in advance and had to change it to a show on the following day. Wrote emails, called very day, including the same day I booked the event, and there's never an answer from customer service, even when you register for a callback.  Once you bought the tickets, good luck making any changes or contacting anyone. When you call, you can hit \"1\" to buy tickets or \"2\" to contact customer service. I have never been successful with option 2, so I tried option 1 thinking they may prioritize new sales. Could not get through on that line either and am on the phone as I write this, one hour an fourteen minutes on hold. I doubt if the phone line is even staffed. NON-EXISTANT CUSTOMER SERVICE. Close to $900 down the drain. Going to file a complaint with the better business bureau. I'll never attend one of their shows again."

I have watched the Algeria show in Montreal and by experience I knew she will love it. We were both blown away by the show. My favorite one is the \"storm show\" in which the performers started playing with bass, guitar and had a rock and roll time! My niece loves the fish tank. I am just so glad that I took her to watch to this show and spend some quality time together."

        "We went Sunday for 1:30 Amaluna show at Phila Expo Center in Oaks PA.  We were 5 rows back from the stage semi center.  The view was great, the clowns were great, the whole show was fun to watch.  Lots of acrobatic adventures.  The seats themselves are narrow folding padded stadium seats tightly spaced so are a bit close to the person seated next to you.  That would be the only negative to the show.   We had a bit of heated argument occuring near us which should have had an usher deal with but none were nearby.  Luckily the feuding parties parted ways.  Maybe alcohol should be curbed at this event. Parking was great and close by and they do check your bags and wand over you thru security check.  All of the performers did an amazing \"Amaluna\" job.  Not sure what all the negative reviews were for.  This is a smaller venue but all of the acts were impressive."

        "This was my first visit to a Cirque du Soleil performance so I had an open mind, but for me a circus is about acrobatics and there wasn't enough of it. The acrobatics there was is great and the performances were top drawer, but the show is padded out with a lot of odd stuff like the portly lady and the Nelson lookalike who just giggle at each other doing a clown like sketch that goes on for ages and is seriously odd. The guitar playing girls don't look like they are playing live and the music and singing almost sends you to sleep. The show doesn't flow and out of the 4 of us that went not one of us rated it. Save your money as it's not cheap for the tickets and at £45 a round of 4 drinks the show doesn't fit the billing."

        "Saw this in Royal Albert Hall in London. The acrobatics (and balancing act) combined with the music and drama was absolutely fantastic. There is one little detail that prevents the show from being perfect though; and that's the \"clowning\" between the main acts (a silly love / flirtation story). If that act was replaced with a piece of magic (literately, perhaps), the show would be a must see. We had a great time though, and it was kind of funny to see how many of the artists liked the pictures and feedback we posted on instagram after the show. Their performances are stellar, and being present in their world for two hours in the wonderful Royal Albert Hall is inspiring."

        "We saw this show last night at the Royal Albert Hall. Its the second Cirque du Soleil we have been to. The organisers have lost the plot. The story of a woman coming of age in some distant past did not tie in with the painfully loud contemporary electric guitar music. Of course, acrobats do things that you and I cannot do, but there again they probably can't mend cars or practice law or brain surgery. So we expect top notch acrobatics. Juggling balls, jumping on a see-saw, two learner unicyclists or climbing a pole just doesn't impress anybody who has been to China where amazing acrobatic feats are taken for granted. The best act was a gymnast who skilfully balanced twigs, which left the audience spellbound. I could not see the point of the not so-giant bowl which features so heavily in the posters. The performers merely jumped in and out of the murky water a few times or danced on a platform on top. Finally, the extremely unfunny comedians for the prop breaks were at best seriously bad and at worst the final insult to the audience. They seemed to screech some incomprehensible  language at each other, between poor  crude sexual innuendoes unsuitable for children in the audience. I feel very sad that Cirque du Soleil has come to this. Its what happens when you get big, become a world wide franchise and then sell out to venture capitalists."

        "I have seen many great Cirque Du Soleil presentations over the past years. Especially Kooza, which was a fantastic re-invention of the great artism in Cirque Du Soleil. I have now seen Amaluna in Dusseldorf, and was really disappointed. There are some good artistical presentations, no doubt about that, but the Show as such definitely does not meet the (high) expectations on a new Cirque Du Soleil show. It is in sum - sorry to say - just average, no 'wow' Moment.... and just when you feel on an upward mood, there is this almost ordinary element of the two characters (Lady and Seaman) filling the break and stage remodelling, which definitely does drag the overall Impression down."

It was an awesome show and worth travelling for, combined with an overnight stay and a visit to the shopping mall. We have seen several CdS shows around the world and it is one of their best shows. We both rated Amaluna and Ovo ahead of even O, which is resident in Bellagio Las Vegas. Amaluna has some spectacular acts and brilliant live rock-style music. Being under the Grand Chapiteau is a much better experience than being in an arena or a theatre. Highly recommend this show."

        "WE have seen several Cirque Du Soleil shows in Las Vegas.  Outstanding.  When Amaluna started to advertise we quickly ordered our tickets.  I noticed a phone number to call for tickets.  I was not aware that this is a phone number for a ticket broker.  I ordered 2 tickets and a parking ticket ($40.00).  was told i had to have a parking ticket for handicap parking.  our total came up to over $450.00.  Talket to a couple of people in oyr section.  they paid $80.00 a piece and $10.00 for parking.  I should have ordered them straight on line.",
        "For first time viwers of Cirque Du Soleil, the show was excellent.  We found the show to be very good (not a Vegas show.",
        "knowing we overpaid for our tickets and parking (reg. $10.00) left us with a very bad feeling.  I will be much more causious in future.  Just be aware of ticket brokers.  They will dopple your price"

All female band, as well as majority of female gymnastic performers.  I loved this show and its cast.  If it wasn't such a long drive from my home in the east valley of Phoenix I would see it again"

It use to be a true VIP EXPERIENCE now its is simply 2 hors d'oeuvres and a couple of drink choices, no personal experiences, very overcrowded and this time they did not even have the photographers taking pictures. VERY disappointing. "

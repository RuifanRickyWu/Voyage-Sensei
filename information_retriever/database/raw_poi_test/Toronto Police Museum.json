At the end of the tour she played a game with the children asking them multiple choice questions and gave them prizes.  They all participated and were very excited when they got the right answers. The children were cheering each other on.  Thank you Norina for making this experience so enjoyable.  Great job!"

But, the building and displays are really quite shabby and neglected...the dust on the mounted police officers boots was depressing. A number of the evidence displays had deteriorated to the point that they wouldn't be admissible in court. And some of the glass in the display cases was fogged up and dirty looking.

Only money order or certified check are accepted. If you don't have, the nearest RBC branches are within 250 meters on Young street, one north, one south. Paid to Toronto police service.

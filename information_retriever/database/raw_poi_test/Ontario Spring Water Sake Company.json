He also showed us some byproducts that are used in the beauty industry to produce cosmetics. We could not actually see anything in detail because visitors could introduce bacteria to the production process that may change the taste and quality of alcohol produced. Despite it, we still had a great time."

Smallish place with a sake bar and GREAT tasting sake to suit your personal taste.  Friendly service.  I tried most of their sake and although I have 3 favourites, all were very pleasant to me and my wife.  They take pride in their processes of making fine sake.  As the area is quite small, the tour is contained in the public area in front of glass that separates the public area and the area where the sake is made.  Our tour guide is not only a guide but does assist in the sake manufacturing processes.  He was very informative and friendly as was the staff at the sake bar and of course the owner whom I spoke to.",
        "Most of their sake has not been pasteurized giving better flavour.  It can keep for 6 months after purchasing whether opened or not and must be kept in the fridge.  They do offer sake that has been pasteurized once and can be found at some LCBO stores.  This can be kept for up to one year whether opened or not and does not have to be refrigerated.  I have a slight preference for the flavour of the non-pasteurized sake.",

I bought a sake set made in Japan (and there are some other nice looking ones made in China) and a bottle of sake.  I will definitely return again to buy more sake.  The prices are similar to other brands at the LCBO that have been pasteurized I believe twice.",

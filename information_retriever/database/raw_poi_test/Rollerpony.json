There's Caribbean food, a barbershop, arcade games and even a mini practice rink. It's open 6 days a week and only $15 admission (rentals are an additional $5). There's a pro shop on site and lockers are free too.",

        "It's a great option for anyone on a budget, too; for only $17 (+$5 if you need to rent skates), you get 3 hours (weekend) to 4.5 hours (weekday) in the space.",
        "The music is always fantastic, but there are themed nights for skaters with a favourite genre in mind- check out their Instagram for updates: @RollerponyTO"

        "While the floor looks great I wasn‚Äôt impressed with the surface. Lots of seams, which are easy enough to roll over but there were also lots of waves and bumps. Some places the sticker had air bumps? The design helped me learn where to avoid, watch out for the hula hoopers forehead! ",

I had never been roller skating before but the staff were super helpful in explaining things. It was so fun trying to learn to roller skate with friends and a memory I will cherish. There prices were good especially for the food I was impressed. I would absolutely go back."

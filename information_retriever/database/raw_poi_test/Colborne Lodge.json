        "High Park, in the very center of the city, is an oasis where many are gathered citizens in the winter and summer. For everybody at a glance at all times of the year: sports grounds, zoo garden, skating rink, swimming pools, long walkways, children's castle, indoor parts for smooth running of dogs. The peace, thanks to the unspoilt nature, the hilly terrain, the river, and the lake sprinkled with space, can be felt on a concrete or earthy path.",
        "This park is a rare endowment of a fellow architect and artist of art and nature, John Howard. On the plane, the highest point of this park, is the beautiful, simple and picturesque weekend of John and Jamie Hallard built in 1837 - its name is Colborne Lodge. John Howard was one of the first architects in Toronto, as well as a city engineer and geometer. The house itself is famous for its three chimneys, an unusual architecture, a very functional solution to life in it, as well as an interior that besides artistic values ​​also has innovative - small home appliances for the kitchen. All designed, innovated and handled by Howard is done.",
        "The house is designed to have three levels. The entry level, the anteroom from which it enters the living room, then the study room, the sewing room, the dining room, the grocery stores and then the three rooms with wardrobe, tools and painting material. The position of the living room is set up to look at Lake Ontario and exit the large veranda. The stairs are descending into the kitchen, which was deliberately built lower than the ground level, because with this inclination, rainwater was collected and water from the lake could be used for drinking, bathing, as well as for the toilet. Otherwise, it was also the first toilet and bathroom in the house in Toronto.",
        "The house museum is open for visits and on holiday days it is equipped with dishes, food, or decorations depending on the time of the year and holidays. Very nice and magical looks like December, decorated fir, wooden toys and the smell of hot apple juice with cinnamon, which is served with holiday cakes to visitors. If you missed Christmas, come for Easter, but do not miss to smell the atmosphere of this beautiful museum."

We have toured many historic homes but this one had some unique features such as a basement kitchen with hardwood and brick flooring, a greenhouse and original artwork by both John and his wife Jemima. Take a close look at the wood stove in the basement. Enjoyed our visit."

Beautiful interiors and surroundings. From the sound of it it would be worth visiting at Christmas time when the home is decked out for the season and there is festive cooking in the kitchen. They offer an Easter and Thanksgiving program too. Best to contact them too find out. Slightly higher admission prices during the special events but still very affordable. Only open a few days a week including weekends. Free though scarse parking. Make sure to reserve time to enjoy lovely High Park in which Colborne Lodge is located before or after the museums visit."

All of Mr. Howard's land, along with properties adjacent on each side, make up what is now High Park in Toronto.  A great, informative tour of the lodge by a costumed interpreter provided a lot of information about the Howards, about the early days of Toronto and some geography lessons as well.

She was knowledgable and made the tour fun and interesting for all of us.  We were able to learn about and even touch many objects (even extending to sitting on some of the furniture), thereby learning about life in the 1870s in what at the time was the countryside outside of the city.  The gardens were beautiful and had it been less wet would have been an attraction themselves."

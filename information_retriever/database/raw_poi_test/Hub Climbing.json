  "description": "Hub Climbing is a 20,000 sq/ft facility with a dynamic offering of bouldering, 22 Auto Belays and top-rope climbing for all levels as well as fitness equipment and yoga classes. The safety standards, programming, and group accommodation are high quality along with a committed and hospitable staff.",

        "There are many climbing gyms in the metropolitan Toronto area. I’ve been to Boulderz Etobicoke, TCA, Rock Oasis, True North, and Basecamp. Compared to these, I’d rank Hub Markham second only to Boulderz Etobicoke. Here are my thoughts on Hub with a final thought comparing Hub Markham with Boulderz Etobicoke.",
        "Things I liked:",
        "- Hub is a large gym with a very large Bouldering section compared to its high walls. They have a good selection of auto belays as well. Probably about 2/3 of the climbing are on bouldering walls and 1/3 are high walls. They also have this awesome two storey high bouldering problem with a foam pit below. What a great way to experience the feeling of height while bouldering in a safe environment.",
        "- a nice vibe, you can tell a lot of climbers come here to hang out. Kids, clubs and climbers of all levels. Good to see it’s not an exclusive place.",
        "- prices are the most reasonable as are the rental costs compared to all the other halls I’ve been to so far.",
        "- a great training section on the second level",
        "- boulder problems are great and varied. You’ll have lots to choose from with competition and graded problems.",
        "Things that I thought were “meh”",
        "- first thing is the smell. Pretty strong, sour feet smell. I guess you get used to it after a few minutes. Coming in from outside and then getting that initial whiff was quite impressive. This is not a unique problem to Hub by the way. Other climbing gyms can have a similar problem but I found that Hub had the strongest of the bunch. ",
        "- the foam mats are quite dirty with stains and chalk. A lot of people just hang out sitting on the mats, which may contribute to the wearing down and ageing of the mats. ",
        "- the gap-covers between mats are tripping hazards. There are so many of them! Not that you’ll smash yourself (you’re on a mat!) but still it contributes to that messy, aged, dated look and when dropping down from a boulder problem there are some places where your foot can pass through in between the mats.",
        "- the lighting seems less bright compared to other gyms and the concrete, unfinished walls and concrete floor give the impression that you are in a bunker or warehouse. Not that cosy or bright or energetic. But that is more a personal thing.",
        "- no real “eating/lounging” area where people can get a snack.",
        "If none of these thing bother you then this gym will offer some of the best climbing in the area. There really isn’t anything else that comes close in this area of Toronto! But if you live on the west side or want to climb at the nicest gym in the Toronto area, I’d give Boulderz Etobicoke a try.",
        "There is also a Hub located in Mississauga, which I have not been to (yet) and it looks like it could give Boulderz a real run for its money as being the best climbing gym in the region. If I get a chance to make my way there, I’ll be sure to post a review.",
        "Enjoy climbing! You won’t regret coming to Hub Markham!"

Liked the fact that the day pass lets you have in and out privileges so you can go out, eat something and go back.  I don't like the limited parking though.  Not enough spots. Will go back often to get the exercise we need!"

        "Hub Climbing is straight-up about testing real, authentic physical fitness. You either climb the wall or you don't! You scale the dragon sculpture or you fall into a pit of gold foam.  There is no in-between. Hub Climbing has lots of other activities in-house too; there's exercise bikes, treadmills, and Yoga classes on the weekends. Its a square deal for members and worth the drive for Toronto residents looking for a more exciting workout, or something more interesting than a regular gym."

        "The staff are kind and helpful. The orientation is quick and easy. You will always find a staff around if you need one. ",
        "If you come looking for bouldering, this is your gym. Their walls are reset quite often and they have a wide variety of climbs. If it is your first time, I would recommend attempting the DRAGON.",
        "As for top rope, this gym recently changed 23 out of 26 top rope routes into auto belay once. If you want to top rope with a friend, this GYM IS NOT FOR YOU. Top roping is almost non existent here.",
        "Price. They recently had a price hike that increased roughly 20 to 30% of the original price. It is still pretty hefty to pay 20 bucks just for a day pass and extra for shoes. As for their monthly to yearly pass, you Dave maybe 30 to 60 bucks in total? Not much of an incentive.",
        "In the end, it was the price hike and lack of top roping that swayed my decision to move on to the next gym, but I would reccommend this place to my friends to try bouldering and such."

I've witnessed them yell at the other patrons for parking in their spot."

They also have a really high \"dragon\" feature that lets you drop into a foam pit. I find they don't reset the routes as much but because there are so many I never feel like it becomes stale. They also seem to hold events and have their own team which is worth noting. Note: there is no lead climbing available here!!"

While I wouldn't personally pay the extra money to use it, some might (although I've never seen anyone in it). Staff are very friendly and informative. "

Could probably fit 20 without being a squeeze. They made sure all the kids had fun in a safe environment. There is a fridge and freezer available for us to store the ice-cream cake and fruits. Clean up was no hassle as they did everything. Thanks for an awesome memory."

        "While the grades seem to jump around a little, that is common to the world of Climbing, and this place has a lot of room to work with.  There is accessible climbs sensibly separated from the more aggressive areas, and a comp wall to test your skills on.  Self-belays are there for those without a partner, or they offer a belay partner if you need.  Sadly no sport lead at this time, but the primary reason for going to the Hub is to boulder.  The Dragon is a unique and fun feature, allowing you to highball on several routes with the safety of a giant foam pit for a soft landing.  Will definitely be returning when visiting the area again."

There is a wide variety of climbs for different levels of ability, and it would take hundreds of visits to conquer all the climbs. Levels range from V0 (where I'm at) and beyond. This gym is for the very athletic and for the wannabe athletic like myself. I got a 3 month membership and bought some shoes at MEC. The environment is great for bouldering and climbing. Climbers higher levels are supportive of others. It's also open 365 days a year. Try it out!"

This place is pretty big and has lots to offer for all ages. It is 18.75 for an all day pass. The climbing for the young kids is all supervised by the staff and is big on safety, the rest of the walls offer varying degrees of difficulty. My kids were scaling all the technical routes sometimes successful and other not so much. There is a lot of padding all around the walls and a big foam pit for those who choose to challenge the dragon. If you make it to the top, i believe it is 21 feet.",

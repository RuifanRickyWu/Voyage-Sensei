        "I booked this for last weekend through trip advisor for my girlfriend and I.  I woke up the morning of the tour to an email from the tour operator, saying the tour is cancelled due to poor weather, low cloud cover and thunderstorm risk, and that they would be happy to rebook the tour with me for another date.  I do not live in the area, and was only in the area for the weekend.  I emailed them back, asking for a refund.  This is where my experience with the tour operator went south.  I was told they do not offer refunds due to weather cancellations, and that the booking website says they do not offer these types of refunds.  Finally, the tour operator phoned me, but not until after I had put a refund request into trip advisor.  There, I was directed to where it shows they do not offer a refund for weather related cancellations.  One would think this information would be in their cancellation policy, but it isn't.  It is hidden under additional information.",
        "I finally received a refund for the cost of the tour, minus $25 per person (so $50 in total), to help the tour operator recoup the costs incurred.  I honestly do not have any idea what costs they would have incurred for a tour cancellation on their part.  I was also told that the $50 they kept will be available to me as a credit, should I book a tour within the next year.",
        "I should have checked the weather forecast a little better, and cancelled the tour myself prior to 24 hours before the start time of the tour.  I could at least have gotten all of my money back.",
        "Due to my experience dealing with this tour operator, I would highly recommend that, should a tour be booked through them, that you first ensure the weather will be absolutely perfect for the flight!  Otherwise, good luck dealing with this company for refunds.  As well, based on my dealings with this tour operator, I would not recommend booking through them!  Find another tour operator in the area."

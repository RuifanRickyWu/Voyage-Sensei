  "description": "I am a historian, improv comedian, and infrastructure obsessive. Growing up, I didn't think much about my city—Torontonians tend not to boast about their city. But I've realized this place is far more than meets the eye: Toronto is a vast network of buried waterways, ancient cliffs, the world's largest ravine system, and centuries of waterfront transformation. This history is rarely shared shown to tourists, and is unknown to many locals. I want to show you what makes Toronto extraordinary.",

Having never been to Hamilton before it was a really pretty hike with tree coverage for 90% of the hike. It’s a good hike for all levels."

Needless to say my cousin & I  weren’t disappointed as Matthew was very knowledgeable who kept sharing historical facts throughout our tour with a lot of passion for the subject tied in with humour and encouragement to also socialise with fellow travellers. Surely do one of their trips if you want to see the city through a very different lens that is going to leave you curious to observe the city and it’s surroundings. Be ready to walk A LOT but it will be worth it I promise."

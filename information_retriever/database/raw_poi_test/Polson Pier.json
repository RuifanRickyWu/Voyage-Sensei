        "Polson pier has a great view of the Toronto skyline and possibility of a great sunset behind the Toronto buildings. I drove from Mississauga (around 25 mins) on a weekday and it was relatively empty. There's parking just before the park/nightclub and it was relatively empty around 8 when I reached. I was there till 10:30 pm and it was pretty crowded by the time I left. So it would be advisable to reach early if you want to relish the sunset.",
        "There were few people with their camera/tripods and a separate couple photshoot was going on. Few people were just to enjoying the view and some groups were waiting for the nightclub to open. I don't see any security issue with many people around. Again, try to get in early to avoid parking issues."

        "Me and my girlfriend went to Cabana to for the first time to see one of our favourite dj's of all time. It should have been one of the greatest days of our lives. Instead, while standing by a table (the entire club is surrounded by tables so this situation was inevitable), some fellow came up to me and my girlfriend and threatened to smash us in the head with a bottle for standing too close to they're table. I am 22 and my girlfriend is 20 and this guy was clearly over 30 years old. Four guys surrounded me and my girlfriend shouting and threatening us with violence till we left. Not a single staff member or customer said or did a single thing. After this I told not one, not two, THREE bouncers of the incident which just took place and not a single one even approached the table, let alone kick them out. The bouncers clearly have no concern for the well being of the customers. I asked a bartender to speak to a manager, after asking twice and waiting 30 minutes no manager never arrived. It became clearer at this point that customer service means absolutely nothing to this establishment. ",
        "My girlfriend and I left the bar after only being there for an hour and half and not even seeing the dj we wanted to see out of concern for our safety and well being. I paid 40$ dollars to be get in, and wasted over an hour and $30 dollars in travelling fees only to be threaten and mistreated until our departure. I wouldn't even recommend this establishment to my enemies, let alone ever return here myself. If you enjoy bars that prioritize profits over safety and customer satisfaction, than Cabana is the place for you!"

Regardless of the fact that they open at 12 PM, I don't understand why staff aren't trained to prepare prior to when people arrive. The bar informed us that they could not give us any drinks such as mojito's or pina colada's, so we settled for the rum and coke. And to top things off, it took 2 and a half hours to get a food order! An hour and a half to try to track down someone who would take my food order. I went up to almost everyone I saw who kept redirecting me to other people. Finally, when someone took my order, I had to wait another hour just to get my wrap which was stale and very disappointing. Even though they had nice facilities, the horrible service and unfriendly attitude of the staff is enough to turn me off from ever going back. I would not recommend this place to anyone."

For the entrance fee (around $20), you get access to the bar area, but not the pool (you have to pay extra for this). The scantily clad stewardesses are aloof and unhelpful, and are largely there to smile and make as much in tips as they can. However, if you like looking at scantily clad girls, then this is a good place to visit. Drinks range from around $8 to $10 for a beer, and more for mixed drinks. The pool itself was chilly (even for mid-summer)."

We're a bit spoiled with the Delsea Drive-in in NJ so Screen #2 is a bit on the small side for us, but still a fun and different way to see a movie especially with kids."

The drinks were $7.50 for a rum and coke, and it was $8 for an edamame appetizer (normally less than $5 elsewhere, it's just a plate of salted beans, but gives you an idea of why so many reviews are complaining about the price range). I noted that one of their shrimp appetizers was listed at $48, and for bottle service on the weekends it starts at $220 for their cheapest bottle. This is supposed to be a trendy, resort-style, high-end place, located on the waterfront, hence the high price range.",

        "I bought a wristband for 2 days of admission to this place a Sunday and a Saturday for the following week. Sunday got cancelled because of weather they wouldn't give me back my money because it was for two days and so they said I can attend both Saturday and Sunday following week. ",
        "Attented Saturday and got it which was a mistake since this place is for rich jerks. No table No chairs unless you want to spend over $1000 for reservations. I was surprised they didn't have a cap for the amount of oxygen you can inhale! Anyways right in the middle of crowd saw drunk jerks walking around and witnessed a couple of sexual harrassments and none of staff even bothered to follow up. ",
        "When i was taking the wrist band off of the card i noticed it was weitten small where the band is attached to the card so theres no way you can notice it unless you take it off: attend before 3 pm so since there's nothing about it on yhe card i didnt care on Saturday i happened to be there at 2 but next day got there exactly 3:20 so the bouncer didn't let me in and asked for me to pay full admission which was lower than what i originally paid. ",
        "Customer service sucks, staff have no clue about customer service  and I ended up over paying because the original event that got cancelled was more expensive. Overall i wouldn't recommend this place to anyone even if it's FREE admission. "

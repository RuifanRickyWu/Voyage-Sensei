        "Great way to spend an afternoon. We visited 3 different craft breweries, each with their own unique qualities. Great Lakes Brewery gets the nod as the leader in terms of tutored tasting, breadth of product, and hip swag. Most established of the three, so the others might have time to catch up. Henderson was really cool, and a close second. Really busy place with lots going on in their event space, but some time with the head brewmaster and guided tasting. Black Oak came in third, but bronze ain’t bad with this kind of competition. Nice tour and our TBT Gavin took the reigns on the tasting. Their sour was a standout for me. ",
        "Kudos to Gavin for driving and hosting at each of the stops and making for a fun filled, learning experience. One suggestion for those going.....eat before you go. With a noon meetup and 12:30 start at stop #1, unless you have an iron stomach and can manage on potato chips between stops, there are scant opportunities to eat along the way, and 5pm is a long time to stretch from breakfast, even a late one."

        "I received this as a Christmas present, so my friends and I recently did the West End Tour.  I was rather underwhelmed with the entire tour.  Maybe it was the timing, as we did the 6:00 PM tour on a Saturday, but it didn't really seem like a tour, as much as a beer tasting.  The first stop, the brewery owner dropped by unexpectedly so he gave us a short tour, which lasted about 10 minutes.  If he had not stopped in i expect it would not have been a tour of the floor. Then we proceeded to have four 5oz flights.  The beer was great.  The next stop there was no tour, just the four flights.  It was explained to us what we were drinking, but it was really not much more than that.  We did walk through the shop floor while going to the back room for the tasting.  The third stop was also just a sample of the beers (four 5 oz flights), and as there was a private event happening there was no tour.  Overall, I had fun but simply because I was with friends. My friends and I spent over $400 in total for the tickets, and frankly, we could have done it 100% on our own with Uber/Taxi and done it for a lot cheaper.  After all, there was not much of a tour to it and we received a little less than 4 Pints in total."

We visited three breweries and were served a flight of about 20oz total at each brewery. Although very well done, the tickets seem to be a bit overpriced seeing that on top of the roughly 60oz of beer you get over the whole tour, the only other costs to factor in are the Guide's salary, company's cut, and the ride from Broadview Station, between breweries, and back to the station. We still tipped Reese well at the end. It was a great way to learn about beer however you likely can go between breweries in Toronto and buy more beer for a cheaper price."

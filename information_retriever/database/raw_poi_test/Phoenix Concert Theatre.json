I cannot comment much on the venue itself so don‚Äôt take my review based on that factor, but if you‚Äôre someone who likes feeling secure and comfortable I would not recommend this venue with their security who seem to enjoy the the more negative side of their job over anything. Very much actions first, conversation later‚Ä¶ or never with this venue. If you‚Äôre in the wrong place at the wrong time then your journey here will be a waste of time and money despite how polite and reasonable you may be. Treated with very little respect alongside a very strong threatening underlying feeling wether you are in the right or wrong. Whatever side of that argument you may be there should be a level of professionalism and basic humanity everyone should be treated with that truly is not met here. But hey, I‚Äôm just your average mid 20‚Äôs event goer so what do I know ( never been ejected in 8 years of events). So heads up people if you want to enjoy yourself like any other person here, be prepared to be under strict scrutiny by all staff and security. ‚úåüèº"

We were up at the front and the bass was so strong that you couldn‚Äôt hear the melody on most songs and it was shaking you to your very core.

I liked that there were multiple bar spaces so there was never a long wait for drinks. The bathrooms were clean. There was a lot of seating available.

I occasionally smoke and wanted to go out side to have a cigarette and was given very unclear directions on how to get to their smoking area.  I was finally able to find the door after battling through the crowds to get there tottering on 4 inch heels which I'm not used to wearing (for my costume) and then had to climb down steep fire escape stairs to get to the smoking area. Exhausted to try and get there I momentarily sat on the stairs to get my wind back and was immediately told by \"security\" to get off the stairs and I apologized and immediately got up and went down the stairs saying I just had just needed to sit for a couple of seconds and asked why it was an issue.  I was told it was a violation of insurance and out of curiosity I asked who their insurance provider was (I work for an insurance company and always pitch us as the best) and was told I had to leave.  In shock I asked why and was told I was drunk (I had one drink and had ordered a second drink which I had only had a few sips of in a 3 hour period of time) and denied the accusation.  I was asked how many drinks I had and told them two (which as per my earlier statement it was actually less than that) and advised them they could even ask the bartender or even do an alcohol test on me and was then told I was rude to the staff.  Again, in disbelief I stated I only asked a question and how on earth by asking who their insurance provider was could be deemed as rude and went on to explain that I work for an insurance company (and although did not tell them that I actually work in HR and hired all of the security staff for my company which I have excellent relationships with).  I then realized that I was being subjected to \"power tripping\" and anything I said in my own defense would only fall on dumb ears and as I was there with a group of other people sucked it up and apologized saying I was deeply sorry if I mistakenly and unknowingly insulted anyone, that it was not done on purpose and would not happen again. They allowed me to go back in with a warning if there were any more incidents I would have to leave.  After getting back inside I told the group I was with what happened and we all abruptly left the venue as I simply didn't want to stay there and felt very uncomfortable.  I was and still am extremely angry at what transpired and the so called \"incident\".  Again I hire people for my company including all of our security was well as fraud investigation staff and am very careful to vet them to ensure they know of our strong customer values to ensure the best customer experience which obviously the Phoenix does not but instead was subjected to and had to endure rather dubious customer experience which will not be repeated - ever. I will never go back nor will my friends who were with me last night. I am off to another party this evening with another large group of friends and will be sure to tell them of my \"experience\" at the Phoenix as well as posting on FB and Instagram.  Don't go there unless you are in the mood for paying money to be harassed and abused by their security for no reason."

        "Attended Us The Duo concert with my teenager daughter and a couple of her friends.  I was impressed with how organized thei were while we stood in looking me waiting to go in.  Staff kept checking to ensure everyone was in the correct line.  Once in, I realized there was no seating option for us (I‚Äôd never been to a general ticket venue).  I had just had knee surgery and knew I wouldn‚Äôt be able to stand.  I spoke to staff asking if there was any chance I could sit at all and within minutes I was sitting beside the stage, the bartender offered to get me anything I needed and staff were so helpful and respectful.

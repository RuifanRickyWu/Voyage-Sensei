This was unforgettable, exquisite, impactful dinner theatre at its finest and most creative. The brilliance of founding director, Diane Dupuy, and current director, Joanne Dupuy, shines through as the Famous People Players cook, serve and perform their hearts out, manuvering giant, colorful blacklit puppets to musical numbers like Send in the Clowns, Candy Man, Jailhouse Rock and other numbers by new Canadian musicians that soothe the soul and provide inspiration for the ages. Love abounds in this unprecedented, magnificent performing arts experience. Go FPP; we love you! A shout out to all Toronto businesses, foundations and individuals who have made the Famous People Players possible and given the world the gift of their presence for 50 years and counting!"

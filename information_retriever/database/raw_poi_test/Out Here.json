        "I have been living and working in Canada on an IEC and it was the end of my work visa and I wanted to see as much of this beautiful country as I could. I considered driving there from BC but decided it was a bit far for me on my own, I thought about flying over and taking the train or hiring a car but looked at the expenses of it and it was just going to cost so much without factoring in anything to do. I had also looked at East Coast trips and couldn't find anything that was just doing Canada while giving a good opportunity to really see everything besides the major cities. ",

Because someone else is driving for you which means you can nap, catch up with emails or facebook, watch movies or listen to the music of the area as provided by Jared. ",
        "The trip that I did was The Big One and it was great to be able to see so much of Eastern Canada in one trip. My favourite place that we visited was probably Tadoussac, we had an amazing whale watching experience and trekked some sand dunes and it was just an adorable, relaxing town. The hostel we stayed in had communal dinners and some fun outdoor team building type activities so it was chilled out and relaxed. The bucket list item for me was seeing Hopewell rocks in New Brunswick with the 14m tides and loved Quebec city. Heading out in Fall (September trip) was a great time to go to avoid a lot of the crowds and to see some of the amazing fall foliage with its array of colours. ",
        "I can absolutely recommend this trip as it is easy, stress free, a good balance of time with new friends and time alone, unique experiences and accommodations (including a  jail!) great value for money and quick responses (I booked 2 weeks before departing)"

If your are looking to experience Eastern Canada with a small group of young, adventurous people then this is the tour for you!

        "I joined Out Here in Quebec City, since I had to opt for the trip called \"Almost Big One\" (which means I missed Ontario). It was amazing. Just before that, I'd had a pretty lonely journey by myself for 3 weeks, and when it was finally time to join the group in Quebec, I was overwhelmed with how friendly and welcoming everyone was. They had already developed inside jokes, and seemed to be getting along like friends who'd known each other for years. I quickly ended up being adopted by the group, and soon I felt like I had known them for a long time as well. The social aspect of this journey is one that fills a lot, and it was what meant the most to me out of everything on this journey. And even in spite of that, I was blown away by many of the things we saw. We got so close to whales that they could blow water on us, we stumbled upon a moose and her two calves in tow (we were less than 10 meters away because they were so close to the trail!), and we also survived Hurricane Dorian together! So many more things happened on this 21 day long journey, and they were all made so much better by the fact that I was in good company!",
        "Speaking of good company, there is also the question of our tour guide! My group was blessed with Janelle, a wonderful person who made this trip so much better! She knew her stuff about all the things we saw, and always had a fun fact to throw out there when we passed something interesting! She even made \"the lighthouse game\", in which we had to call out all the lighthouses we could see from the bus, with the winner recieving a prize! And the best thing? She didn't feel like that much of a tour guide, more like another friend (who knew how to drive a bus) on this wonderful journey across Quebec and The Maritimes!",
        "It's also both a challenging and relaxing trip. You will be challenged by some of the hikes (if you choose to go on them), but we also went to a spa one afternoon to unwind from a very long hike. But remember, every activity is optional, and you can do what you want wherever the bus takes you!",
        "All in all I would HIGHLY recommend this trip for anyone who wants to travel, but knows that they don't want to do it alone. You will be in good company! I made so many good memories on this trip, and all I can say is thank you, Out Here and Team Beaver! You made my trip to Canada 10 times better!"

        "This trip was nothing short of amazing! It managed to include the must-see tourist spots as well as smaller, niche yet incredible places which I would never have gotten to see without this tour! Jared, the owner, you can see has put a lot of thought into getting the most out of 26 days because every day was filled with so many different adventures and activities. What I loved especially was how it had a ‘choose your own adventure’ kind of vibe and this is what made it the best organised tour I have been on (this was my 5th tour like this). Having that flexibility and malleability to each group makes you feel like they really do care about you getting the most out of your trip as it felt like there was a personal touch to it which bigger companies don’t give. Janelle, my tour guide, only exacerbated this feeling- for example, one day she drove me and one other girl to this spa (which was only $17!!) just because we fancied it. ",
        "If you are sitting there considering doing this tour, just book it because you won’t regret it. I had one of the best months of my life with 'out here' and I couldn’t recommend them enough to take you through East Canada! Happy Travels!"

        "Travelling with Out Here was an amazing experience and I’m really glad I decided to do the Central/Maritimes 13/14 Days trip with them.  Every day of the trip was filled with activities and you get a sense of Canada through experience, not just sight-seeing.  White water rafting was the best – I don’t know how to swim but they were supportive enough to help me trust my life jacket and I made it to the end.  Quebec City was just magical and I’d love to visit again during the Fall/Winter.  Whale watching and kayaking were fun and the hikes were beautiful.  All the activities are worth doing and they allow you to go at your own pace.  I’m glad I did all of them!  Our guide made sure we made stops to enjoy the scenery, even if we were on a tight schedule.  Overall the experience was outstanding and especially for someone who is new to adventure tours, this company was a really good place to start with.  Information about expenses and itinerary were provided early on and Jared was really good about responding to inquiries/concerns within a reasonable time.  My guide, Janelle, was wonderful!  She made sure we were informed about the places we were visiting, made sure we got there on time and was very accommodating for bathroom breaks when we were on the road.  She also introduced Terrance which helped create a very unique sense of bonding.  If you’re looking for an authentic Canadian experience of the Maritimes, definitely check them out!"

        "Going on a trip with Jared (Out Here Travel) is ideal for people who don’t want to plan anything in advance, but still want to enjoy all the beautiful spots East Canada has to offer. I doubt that there is a better way to see as many breathtaking views, do as many hikes, go partying in cities and experience different provinces in such a short time. Stargazing as you’ve never done before in Algonquin Park. Hiking in Mont-Tremblant, staying at a cosy hostel near a lake and spending the day in the national park. Beautiful views on Cape Breton Island as well as incredible beaches in PEI and Gaspésie. My favourites, but the list goes on... ",
        "I wouldn’t describe myself as the most adventurous human being (and I didn’t do all of the activities offered) but I really appreciated that stepping out of my comfort zone was part of the/my journey. I didn’t sign up for river rafting at first, but then my group and Jared convinced me to go anyway – which turned out to be the best thing I could have done – definitely my personal highlight! As well as trying oysters, which felt like drinking sea water, but was totally worth the experience. I loved the salmon and the seafood pasta we once cooked, though! To all the seafood lovers: this is it. ",
        "One thing you need for sure: energy. Lots of it. You spend most of the time outside, whether you’re in cities or nature. That’s why you stop worrying about things you would usually worry about, which is one of the many things I appreciated during these days: You get your mind off unimportant things. Also, you move a lot, to which you get used to quickly. (Believe me, I’m from Switzerland). Jared has a great bus, (sometimes) good music ;-), films and makes sure everyone gets their bathroom break and a coffee from Tim Hortons. Sadly, I got sick during the trip, but I was able to stay in the hostel for a day and luckily there are pharmacies almost everywhere you go. Plus, everybody in the group will look after you and Jared’s first priorities always were your well-being and you being able to have the best time ever. ",
        "One more thing: Travelling with the same guys for a whole month may sound scary and isn’t always simple (dinner organization), but I really enjoyed getting to know a bunch of incredible human beings from all over the world, bonding and experiencing crazy stuff with them during a month. No comparison to the “hostel friendships” you make otherwise.",

        "100% recommend! I joined the tour half way through when I met the group on a pub crawl while staying at the hostel in Halifax. I was on a solo backpacking trip in Canada, getting around by catching rides, buses and hitchhiking. However getting around on my own was extremely difficult and I wasn’t able to lots of stuff that I wanted to (and things I didn't even know about!). Out Here made that possible. I was really lucky they were able to include me in their group! ",
        "I’m not one to usually partake in group trips as I like to be a non-tourist and experience new cultures from a local perspective. And that is exactly what Out Here made possible. It really wasn’t a tour, but a group of people exploring Canada with someone who knew where to go and the good stuff arranged. Jared (the guide) was super flexible, always asking our opinion giving us options to stay longer/shorter if we wanted to in all the places we went. ",
        "The bus was super cool, lots of room, and decked out with Canada paraphernalia (pro tip- bring a pillow). There was a decent amount of driving (as we were in Canada), but it was worth it as we had time to see the spots worth exploring and skipping the spots that weren’t worth visiting. We always had enough time in each place.",
        "With the group I got to experience Canada with people from all around the world. I didn’t realize it, but only young people are allowed on the trip, creating a really fun vibe, I definitely met some awesome people.  We stayed at hostels and cooked dinner together, which made the trip really affordable. We ate local food, stopped at fruit and potato stands along the way. I have a new appreciation for new potatoes and even tried clams and oysters for the first time (and maybe the last). ",
        "Having fun and making sure we had a good time was Jared’s number one priority. He didn’t take us to any tourists traps. I truly feel like I was able to experience Canada from a locals perspective. It was a great vibe.",

I truly would not have been able to see and experience everything we did on my own. We went on incredible hikes on the Cabot trail, explored countless beaches on prince edwards island and spent hours driving through breathtaking views. ",

But that wasn't much, as the trip was really packed with great activities. Our favourite part was seeing the awesome wildlife - actual Moose on the Cabot trail! And the cute deers in the Laurentians! But the best was definitely the whales we saw on the kayaking trip out of Tadoussac - a real once-in-a-lifetime experience.",

The trip is designed with flexibility in mind, activities are not compulsory (although highly recommended) whilst in cities there is ample time to explore at your own pace. I would definitely recommend The Big One if you have time, you'll only be wishing the trip was longer!"

You are always looked after, his knowledge about Canada is amazing and he is awesome!! He also encourages you to experience things you never thought you would with his excellent recommendations, for me I never tried Lobster or any sea food but after this trip I am a huge fan! ",
        "I would recommend the Big trip, it’s worth it! As a solo traveller I did this tour and I have no regrets and wish I could do it all again, you make amazing and life long friends and the trip is the best I have ever done. Cabot trail, bay of Fundy, Tadousssc are just a couple of amazing places you see on this tour.",

Lay under the stars at night in Algonquin park and see them as you never have before. Float and swim in beautiful lakes or rivers that never end..",

There is a perfect blend of sightseeing, hiking, camping and activities arranged on this trip. The guys did a fantastic job on picking all the locations that you get to go.

        "I had a fantastic time on the Big One trip - a 26 day tour but I only did 13 days to fit in with my own travel plan. I loved travelling with a small group and the camping/outdoors style. It was good having a mix of camping and hostels rather than just one or the other and I also loved the food that was provided with the tour. I had no dietary requirements but I noticed the one guest who did had all her requirements met which I thought was fantastic (and no boring or plain meals). Joe was helpful and informative but also really fun and cool to hang out with. Overall if you're someone who would like to see Eastern Canada and loves hiking, camping, the outdoors and doesn't want to blow the budget I would highly recommend this tour! Especially if you want to get out of the major cities and see more of what Canada truly has to offer. "

As it was early in the season it was still cold for most of the tour although we did have a few nice days which meant we were able to take a dip in some of the beautiful lakes. The hostels we stayed at were all great, a lot of them with there own quirks which made them all different.",

It was with a small group tour where people from different parts of the world who wanted to see beautiful places in Eastern Canada for a week. We went to Algonquin Park, Ottawa, Mont Tremblant, and Montreal. This trip was amazing since it offered a balance of adventures, sightseeing, and fun. Activities were camping, hiking, canoeing, swimming, cooking, campfire, stargazing, and sightseeing. There were days we ended the day with games, eating and drinks to cap off the night.  I got to meet, know and build friendships with an amazing group of people during the trip. I definitely enjoyed this trip because of the amazing people I got to know, share stories with, learned life experiences and went together on adventures during the trip. I will always remember and look back at this trip for years to come. If you are a solo backpacker who wants to get out of your comfort zone, see amazing places, go on a budget-friendly trip, meet amazing people, and have everything planned out, then Out Here Travel is the way to go! Thank you for this awesome adventure! Go \"Out There\" to start an adventure you will remember and look back on. Do it!"

We covered alot of ground in 7 days and we saw alot of awesome stuff, yet the tour didn't feel rushed and we had heaps of time in each location. I'm glad we were mostly immersed in nature and having real experiences like camping, hiking and swimming, instead of going city to city like most tour companies. It was such an easy way to enjoy a part of Canada that I wouldn't have otherwise seen. Janelle was an awesome tour guide who knew all the secret spots and made everything a breeze. Our group felt like a family at the end and Im so glad I chose Out Here Travel for my time in Canada. Thankyou for everything!!"

There was options for snowshoeing, ice skating, skiing/snowboarding, cross country skiing, tobagoning, dogsleding, snow tubing and more. Also there is enough time to explore the cities and Jared always tries his best to make it possible if there are additional activities you would like to do.

        "I had an absolutely incredible 2 weeks with Jared and his bus of other adventurers on the Central trip that ran from Toronto, through locations such as Algonquin national park, Quebec City and Bay of Fundy to Halifax! I am British and had been working at a camp in Canada for the summer and Jared’s trip was a great way to wind down, relax and see the beautiful and wild side of east Canada. One thing that made it so great was that I never felt forced to do anything I didn’t want to do on the trip: Jared created a friendly and fun atmosphere and he always did his best to cater for the needs of his travellers and found ways to be able to do what they wanted to do. I loved his passion for this part of the world: he would always play local music on the bus and would often commentate as we drive on interesting things to see, as well as giving us lots of recommendations of what to do at different places. The add-ons, such as white water rafting, via ferrata, and whale watching are all an absolute must! I had so much fun at every place we went to, everyone on the bus was so energetic and enthusiastic and this was no doubt a response to the amazing trip that Jared planned. I recommend that anyone who wants to see east Canada in a relaxing, fun and cost efficient way should definitely join Jared OUT HERE!"

In every place he was happy to share interesting information about the sights, best places to eat for everybody's taste and even took the whole group out to his favourite \"boîte à chanson\" for live pub music. Since he seems to be running on music, he even prepared a special playlist for each province we came to - so we got to know a lot of local bands, songs and music styles - which I personally appreciated very much since I'm not interested in listening to just \"mainstream\". We had such funny singing rides while being on the road - that's simply a thing you can't help sometimes if you're going on a tour that big. ",

        "Wow, where do I even start…I can genuinely say that the three weeks I spent on my Out Here Tour were some of the funniest weeks of my life thus far! I was hesitant booking any tour at first, as I’m the type of person who generally likes to do their own thing at their own pace. However, as I continued researching Canada, I realised that all the things I wanted to see were very far away from each other, and some only really accessible by car, and I’m not old enough to hire one. So when Out Here popped up on my Instagram, I seriously started to consider a tour as a way to see everything I wanted to. From reading the itineraries and other reviews, I could sense that this tour was exactly what I wanted - flexible, geared towards younger people, and including the adventurous activities that I love.",
        "For starters, camping in Algonquin Park was an awesome way to bond with the rest of the group - we hiked, swam and canoed (including watching and laughing at the group that capsized) all in the first day. On the way to Ottawa came one of my favourite parts of the trip…white water rafting! We spent an amazing day on the Ottawa River - riding the rapids, swimming, jumping off rocks and then having lunch. By the end of the day my arms hurt from paddling but my stomach hurt from laughing so hard when people fell out of the raft. ",
        "I had an awesome time in Quebec City, and really started to form bonds with the members of the group. Leaving the cities far behind and heading up to Tadoussac was awesome. The hostel we stayed was quirky but an absolutely awesome time and we saw an incredible amount of whales (up close!) whilst whale-watching. The place we stayed at in Bay of Fundy was homey and the town itself very quaint - had an awesome time sea-kayaking. Our guide Joe was really flexible when the guy in the coffee shop suggested a good swimming spot in the Fundy National Park, and we had a wonderful time swimming in a beautiful river before having fish and chips.",
        "The hikes and scenery in Cape Breton was one of my highlights - the hikes we did were some of my favourite. Joe was really good at explaining the different options available for different levels of experience and fitness, and ensured that everyone did what they were comfortable with. We visited this incredible swimming spot in an abandoned quarry that had been filled in - which was a welcome cool-off after a hike to a wonderful lookout.",
        "On my last day I was so sad to leave the amazing friends that I had made over my time in Canada - and I desperately wished that I had booked the Big One Tour! I could not recommend Out Here more…I am so glad I choose to explore Canada with them and so grateful for all the wonderful things I got to see and the people I got to meet. Thanks so much to Jared for his awesome organisational skills and to Joe for being a wonderful guide."

        "I should say first off that I have travelled with quite a few different tour companies - (G Adventures, TrekAmerica, Contiki, Busabout, Gap360) so feel (relatively) qualified to say Out Here are a good company to travel with.  I'd been considering a trip to Canada for a while but kept putting it off as it always worked out too expensive to see everywhere I wanted to on my own, and most group trips I looked at didn't seem to cover the places I wanted to visit.  Until Out Here Travel popped up on my social media news feed one day, and ticked both boxes of being affordable and covering a lot of ground in the process.  For the amount of ground covered (5 provinces and all major cities in Eastern Canada) it worked out way cheaper than if I had tried to travel between places on my own.  Being a relatively new company, I hadn't heard much about them, but didn't want to pass up the opportunity to finally explore a country I'd been waiting so long to visit.  Fortunately, I wasn't disappointed, and feel safe saying that they are a great company to travel with.",
        "I never felt rushed in any of the places visited as we got to stay 2-3 nights in each location, in order to fully appreciate the spot.  Our guide, Joe, always gave us an orientation pointing out the best spots to eat or drink before leaving us to our own devices.",
        "The hikes were amazing, Canada's scenery is next to none!  However, the cities are not to be missed either, and I felt we had a good mix of nature and city life.  ",
        "The Light show in Ottawa was brilliant, telling the story of Canada through light and sound on the Parliament Building (and is completely free!).  We were very much given the opportunity to do as we pleased, and nothing on the tour is compulsory.  However, I would highly recommend the white water rafting (and this is coming from someone who rafted the Zambezi - the world's best for white water rafting).",
        "Quebec City felt very European compared to the other cities.  Joe took us to a place where we had bottomless mimosas for only $15, then went to cool off in a fountain as it was a hot day, which was great fun. ",
        "Tadoussac was a highlight, both for the whale watching (in which we were lucky enough to see a fin whale breaching several times), and for the hostel which is one of the more interesting I have stayed in - stilts, balancing beams and other outdoor activities to a backdrop of live folk music, followed by a DJ.",
        "Bay of Fundy was also an interesting hostel - a residential house with adjoining annex, within easy walk of the beach.  Joe walked us down to the caves at night so we could see the difference between the high and low tides, then we drank around a bonfire back at the hostel.  The sunset kayak the next day is something else I would recommend (though again not compulsory) as you get to see more of the coast than you would otherwise get the opportunity to, and a snack is also provided at a secluded beach on the journey back.",
        "Halifax was possibly my favourite city.  We went on a brewery tour in the morning, followed by axe throwing in the afternoon (possibly not the best order as I was terrible at axe throwing after sampling all the beers, but still thoroughly enjoyed myself).",
        "Cabot Trail was more amazing scenery and hiking.  Our Tour Guide, Joe, cooked lobsters for us on the one night as the area is well known for it.",
        "PEI had the best beaches on the trip.  There was one particularly fun beach where we could jump off a bridge into a riptide, which carried us back to the shore.  ",
        "The hostel in Gaspesie was an experience all on it's own - our whole group stayed together in one yurt, right on the beach front.  The bar had live music and there were bonfires on the beach.",
        "Our final hike at BIC National Park was my favourite of the trip.  Not necessarily because of the scenery (although it was still stunning, as usual in Canada), but just because of how genuinely fun the actual hike was.  The second part of the hike was spent jumping and climbing over rocks along the coast (not as strenuous as it sounds).",
        "The final stop, Montreal, is definitely the place to be if you're a foodie.  I don't think any of us could disagree that Montreal had the best food in Canada.  Any type of food you could want can be found there, and of a good quality.",

This is coming from experience since I have also travelled with the Stray bus in New Zealand and a few local tours in the UK, each tour has its own unique vibe which I cannot deny, Out here definitely has. Whilst they are still a fledgling company with only two big tours going around the East coast of Canada; Jared was ever so helpful with my last-minute booking onto the ‘almost big one’ tour. He happily answered any and all questions I had as well as kept me up to date on where the rest of the group were on their trip after I decided I was going to be in Quebec City a few days earlier than I originally planned to be. The trip itself was both relaxing and busy; every other day was yet another hike into the wilderness or a slight walk which I thoroughly enjoyed after spending so many days bouncing between cities.

        "The accommodation on this trip was a mix of both hostels and camping which really took me back to when I worked at a summer camp. Janelle, the driver was great, essentially letting me take over fire building and making camp-fire food for myself after I expressed an interest in doing so. She was very accommodating to what people wanted to do; letting us decide between a fairly difficult hike up mount Albert, staying at the Sea Shack for the day or opting to do an easier hike. Though the hike was rather difficult it was much more enjoyable once we were at the top and had the amazing views that we wouldn’t have had if we hadn’t done it; I’m glad that she gave us the option and that we decided to ‘go big or go home’ so to say.

        "One thing I have to say about the tour is that it’s not one for someone who likes to stay in the city, it certainly goes off the beaten track to places I wouldn’t have even thought about visiting if we hadn’t stopped there on our trail. Places like Tadoussac, Riviere du Loup and the Bay of Fundy were some of my favourite places to visit because of how diverse they were, really getting away from the tourist-oriented Quebec City, Montreal and Toronto and into the more local flavours that Canada has to offer. Taking a horse-ride on Prince Edward Island was something I wasn’t expecting to do but I was grateful that I did decide to go, considering that I didn’t take part in a few of the other activities such as Whale Watching, Via Ferrata and Kayaking. Whilst the rest of my group enjoyed their activities I found myself enjoying the peace and quiet, wandering around the small towns and finally catching up on some well deserved relaxation. ",
        "Essentially living on a bus with a group of people (10) for 21 days was like living with a bunch of friends that you just can’t get away from no matter how hard you may try. I’m joking about that, we became in a sense one big unruly dysfunctional family and by the end of it; it was sad to see everyone go. Every day was kind of a new adventure, we’d see something different or learn a new piece of information whether it was about one of our group or even about a place we were at that day. The first few days for me were hard to adjust to, since I have been travelling alone for such a long time; just being around people that would know more than just the usual three answers to the usual three questions you get at every hostel you visit was a little daunting but after the first night when we were in Quebec City, I felt welcomed. Janelle made it easy to track the rest of the group down, since they were wandering the city. From then on, I was practically one of the team; even if I had to walk back to my own hostel that night before joining them officially the next day. All in all, it was a great trip; well worth the time and effort it took to sort out and book. ",
        "My only criticism would be that half the time I barely knew where I was, though I didn’t mind that myself, since as long as I’m having a good time, I don’t really care where I am. Some of the others on the bus suggested that an itinerary would have made it a lot better for them; mainly so that they could know roughly when they would be arriving in certain places. I can see the benefits of this if you like to plan ahead or even write up to date notes on your trip; both of which I rarely do.",
        "Overall I believe Out Here to be the best way of seeing east coast Canada if you are backpacking alone or just want to get a little bit further out there and see some of the obscure regions that are often unavailable to get to without driving long distances yourself."

        "I have just returned from the Big One tour and it was incredible! I have had such the best time on the tour! The tour was really well planned (Jared was great at answering questions prior to the tour via email) and covered a good variety of national parks, beaches, cities, hikes and other optional activities. My guide was Janelle, who put so much enthusiasm into the tour - she did a great job! My highlights were via ferrata as the setting was amazing, plus whale watching and white water rafting were also great fun. I was drawn to this tour company as the price seemed really reasonable considering what they offer. Because of this, I knew that the accommodation would be in hostels and camp sites, so if this isn't for you then it's not the tour for you, but the hostels all had good facilities and were clean. Some of the hostels were livelier than others, so again it provided a good range throughout the tour. A lot of the time we cooked our meals at the hostel, but in cities there was the options of eating out for those that wanted. I experienced some amazing food - poutine (vegetarian option in Montreal) and Cows ice cream parlour. Overall, if you are looking at visiting Canada, I would highly recommend Out Here Travel to explore what the East has to offer!"

        "I only had the time available to do the central trip and it was awesome - I just wish I could have done the Big One! It was such a good way to experience the Canadian East Coast and in we were in a great group of 10 solo travelers - plenty of room on the bus! I loved all the activities like hiking, canoeing, white water rafting, kayaking, and via ferratta and also exploring each of the cities that we stopped in. It was an unforgettable trip the only thing that could have improved it was if I'd done the big one instead of just the central trip!"

We all just went along with the flow, did amazing hikes, canoeing, and ofc roasted schhmmoorrees!! Each hostel was so different (the Ottawa jail hostel was definitely one of a kind) and it was nice to see another side of Canada🇨🇦 Everybody was super nice and open minded, including the locals, our leader Janelle was super cool too, and it definitely was a unforgettable experience💛"

        "No regrets! ",
        "There's 4/5 nights camping/glamping, and the rest in hostels; each has a specific charm (staying in an old jail, in a hippy sea shack, in the heart of old Quebec) which makes it always exciting to discover.",
        "The cities and landscapes you visit are really diverse and beautiful, a few are earned after long hikes. Many places to swim too. You come across some wildlife (whales, moose).",
        "The guide takes you to some great places to visit and eat ; meals are a mix of eating out in delicious local places and buying groceries to do your own stuff.",

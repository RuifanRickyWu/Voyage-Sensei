Although the menu list some comicly named cocktails such as \"Riding Through a Live Minefield on a Bicycle Built for Two\" and \"The Drink I Made For Robin That One Time\" the silliness ends there. The drinks are mixed, shaken and stirred with surgical precision and each sip delivers."

Just look for the sign in the street."

The small plates are priced right for their size, and they are the perfect accompaniment for the drinks.",

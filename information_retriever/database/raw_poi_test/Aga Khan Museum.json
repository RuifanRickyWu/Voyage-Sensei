        "We visited this museum as we were visiting Toronto . Parking is $10 which you can pay as you pay entrance fees inside. It’s 15 dollars for a senior. The outside of the museum is oddly shaped and during spring, summer , and fall there are fountains and gardens in the front of it but unfortunately since it’s winter it was closed. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful..Now this museum introduces Islamic art throughout rare 1,200 objects assembled by its Highness the Aga Khan and Prince Saddrudin Aga Khan. What I enjoyed was seeing the different arts and objects collected throughout the years from different countries. The whole thing was very well explained which I appreciated. It took 1 1/2 hours to 2 hours to visit ."

        "My husband and I enjoyed the artwork on display. The history being portrayed within the museum is very biased in that all of the ways Islam has influenced the world through technological advances, art, culture, and religion would appear to remain pure without the influence of Greeco Roman societies, the Spanish, the Armenians, or any of the other peoples in those areas where Islam has spread to include Canadian culture. While we did not have an issue with the museum and understand the foundation is very pro-Islam, for anyone who would not find this acceptable, I cannot recommend going. The price of the tickets was a bit steep for the amount of time you can spend in the museum. We bought general admission and the whole three floors only took an hour for us to go through. We read every placard in each of the exhibitions. Also, I have lived in many of the nations where the artwork originated. One item of interest to me was the Astrolabe. I have never seen a physical one, so that was a highlight of the trip for us. We appreciate the pottery and learned how pottery could be used as a water filtration system. Again, it was an outstanding learning experience and might well be worth the admission if you have never been to the ancient world. However, for us, few items were unfamiliar. "

The Diwan restaurant requires advance reservations but the separate small cafe is pretty good if you can't get in to Diwan.  Also worth a visit in the area is the Japanese Canadian Cultural Centre."

I particularly liked the special exhibition on \"Sanctuary\", which made the plight of several million displaced persons more real to those of us fortunate not to have to flee our home countries."

There are only 2 floors and a basement. There is a gift shop, restaurant and cafe. The Islamic Centre is a 3 minute walk from Aga Khan. It’s free to visit but we didn’t go. They had a magician at 12:00 for the kids and it was under a tent. The art exhibits were interesting and there was details of each piece. Some of the rooms could have better lighting. It seemed a little dark. There was some musicians sitting on the floor playing instruments in a Middle Eastern style music. It’s a beautiful museum and it’s worth a visit."

No discussion of Islam’s problemmatic leadership today. Also Wish there had been more information about the art itself - how was it done, what guidelines were used, etc. Religion is inherently complex and problematic. It’s a great start but I hope they continue to try to step into the complexity rather than sanitize the topic."

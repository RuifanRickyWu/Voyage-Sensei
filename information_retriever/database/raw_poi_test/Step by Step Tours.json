        "Amazing tour by Erica. It turned out I was the only booking for the day yet Erica didn’t cancel or try to rearrange so I had a very personalised tour! Only spent a couple of days in the city which included a day in Niagara so I really wanted to see as much as I could in the time I had. Erica was able to walk me from one end of the city to the other with lots of things I would definitely not have seen or understood otherwise. Also lots of tips and recommendations for things to do and places to go and set me up perfectly for lunch in the market. Super friendly and put up with my inane questions with patience and humour!",

Our plan worked out perfectly as we all had such a great day. Erica was a fantastic guide providing a plethora of knowledge of the city while making the day super fun as well. The walk was at a very nice pace (not too fast while not lingering too long either) and Erica is the friendliest person ever. Would absolutely recommend the greatest hits tour as well as any she does!"

Her enthusiastic, positive personality and love for her city shone through at each stop!  This 1 1/2 hour tour gave us a taste of more to come, and we would strongly recommend both 'locals' and 'visitors' to take this WALKING tour (walking, rather than riding a tour bus allows one to enter the buildings, not just drive by).  You don't have to go to Europe to see history!!"

We were shown our table and THANKFULLY we had a lovely waitress after that who was smily and attentive. The drinks were fine, but the group of staff who were at the front post at one point were looking over at our table and laughing. We also saw them roll their eyes at another family who they had just served. Group of them just standing around doing nothing it seemed but judging everyone. When we left, none of them said anything to us as we left, not even a smile. I felt very awkward smiling at them on the way out but then again, I‚Äôm not a rude person.

Once again front of house were lovely, and all staff manning the games very cheerful and happy despite the Easter weekend chaos. The restaurant however, was absolutely diabolical. Our waitress (didn‚Äôt catch her name unfortunately) was lovely, and really helpful considering this situation was nothing to do with her.  We ordered the mac and cheese and the fish and chips. I watched the fish and chips be sat under a ‚Äúhot plate‚Äù for 23 minutes before they decided to finally serve us. ",
        "For obvious reasons we sent this back. To then watch the new waiter (didn‚Äôt get his name either) and what only I can assume to be the head chef discuss with each other about my complaint. The chef in the kitchen then proceeded to simply move my food from one plate to another without re cooking or changing the items. I am an ex fast food restaurant manager, I know how customer service works. And this is not how a successful restaurant should be ran. My meal was taken off the bill due to the inconvenience (I barely ate it anyway as it was stone cold). Yet we were still left with a $39 bill. Which in my opinion is unacceptable. ",
        "Bottom line- arcades and front of house staff amazing, really know their stuff and show a genuine interest in their job. ",
        "Restaurant- poorly run and wouldn‚Äôt even bother wasting your time there let alone your money."

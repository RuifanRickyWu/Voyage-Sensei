        "Maria recently relocated her spa but unfortunately her poor service continues, despite raising her prices by 40 percent. My recent facial lacked extractions, facial massage and mask, and she performed two facials at the same time on my daughter and myself. For $125, you expect to have your own esthetician for the hour. Maria also started the service 15 minutes late, while chatting on the phone at the front desk. Who do you complain to about poor service if this is the example set by the owner herself? There’s a reason why the King Edward Hotel no longer wants to be associated with this business; I only returned to use a gift card I’d been given but I won’t be back."

I started by winding down in the relaxation room. Try the lemon tea although the cucumber water is refreshing! My first service was a massage. It was wonderful! I do get a massage every month at home, but this was unbelievable. Back to the relaxation room where I had some more cucumber water and next was my pedicure. Living in Florida and getting a pedi every 3 weeks, this service was fabulous! My feet feel like I'm walking on clouds.....After my pedi it was time for a facial. It was relaxing, it was cleansing, refreshing....I think I fell asleep. My skin feels like new! The last service was a shampoo and blow-dry. Unbelievable! For someone who has straight hair, I still have bounce and curls 5 hours later in very windy weather conditions.",

The spa is privately owned and I was surprised how present the real Maria is there. She was the one who made our appointment on a short notice and managed to accommodate us both at the same time for a facial. Later, another friend wanted to join for a pedicure and Maria found a way to have us all three at the same time. The whole atmosphere is very relaxing, the place clean and lovely. We were greeted warmly and offered some time to unwind in the lobby, sipping lemon tea and catching up with my friend. Then our facials started and it contained also a generous massage of neck and shoulders, hands and feet! My mom was extatic! As a bonus, Maria who was always there coordinating, took my mother for a consultation with Nima, a master stylist. The consultation continued with a splendid hair cut and styling for her. Nima is an amaizing professional and such a nice human being. It was a real pleasure to listen to his competent advice for styling a nonagenarian (!) and later see the result on my mom. Thank you!"

        "I'd like to tell all of you out there a little (true) story. Back in 2001 I got married. At the beginning everyone thinks their marriage is made in heaven, but mine actually was. We loved each other far beyond all rational measure. As a wedding gift, my sister gave us a gift certificate to a place neither of us had ever heard of called Nouvelle Maria Spa and Salon. She gave me a massage and manicure and my husband got a massage and pedicure, since everyone who knew him was well aware of the horrid condition of his feet. Years earlier I had been seeing a massage therapist who would come to my home when I lived with my parents, but since I was now living at almost the opposite end of the city, that person was no longer an option. So, as you can imagine, the gift certificate from my sister was a God send. I am in a wheelchair and my husband, though able to walk was in a similar situation. due to our respective physical conditions we both lived on a regular basis with a great deal of muscle tension. When we returned from our honeymoon in Barbados we thought, \"now that we're in completely relaxed 'island mode', let's go for those massages before the drudgery of 'reality' sets in. So we called the spa and made our appointments. The massages were mind-blowing, and my husband struck up an instant friendship with his pedicurist. We decided to make this a regular routine. Every 2 weeks on Saturdays we went over to the King Edward Hotel for his pedicure and my massage. One day when we entered the door we jokingly said to the owner, \"Hi mom, we're home\". Little did I realize at the time how those words would impact the rest of my life. Just short of 2 years after this fairytale wedding, disaster struck. My husband had a massive seizure that ended his life. My entire existence came crashing down on top of me. I had no idea who to turn to. I saw a grief counsellor for a few months, but it never seemed to affect my emotional state. The only thing in my life that wasn't changed was my standing appointment for my massage and manicure. In fact, as soon as the owner heard of my disastrous news, she increased the frequency of my massages from once every 2 weeks to twice a week. I also started having several other services, such as pedicures, facials and waxing. As a matter of routine I would go in twice a week and have my services, while chatting to the staff, who very quickly became family. It was more than just a routine, it became the therapy that no licensed grief counsellor could provide. One day, when I was having my massage, still deep in the abyss of despair over the loss of my husband, my massage therapist asked me a simple question that changed everything. He very simply asked, \"Would Robin (my late husband) want you to feel this way?\" Instantly everything changed. The fog of grief that I had now been living in for 10 long years, instantly lifted. Those words changed my entire outlook on life. That was 5 years ago now, and I'm now seeing that same RMT twice a week. The people are fabulous, the services are incredible, and the lemon tea, I don't know what the secret is but I use the same ingredients at home, (just lemon, honey and hot water) and it never tastes the same. It's probably the atmosphere and the people who I've grown to love like my own family. For anyone out there in cyberspace who has any issues (and every one of us does), from a broken nail to a broken heart, I strongly urge you to go to Nouvelle Maria Spa and Salon. They can, and will, make you feel like a king or queen. Whether you're an executive who only has half an hour between board room meetings, or a maid of honour looking for the perfect fun activity for a bridal party, Nouvelle Maria Spa and Salon has single services, or entire day packages that are perfect for any occasion. They're open Monday to Thursday from 10:00am to 8:00pm, Friday from 10:00 am to 7:00pm, Saturday 10:00am to 6:00pm, and Sunday from 10:00am to 3:00pm. They changed my life for the better, give them a chance and they can change yours too. ",

        "While in Toronto this past weekend my sister and I got massages at the hotel spa. The massages were great. However, the facilities were old and outdated. The 'rooms' were half walled and you could hear EVERYTHING that was going on around you. My sister heard the person next to her explaining what she wanted the masseuse to work on. The rooms were very bright and very cluttered. I would not recommend the spa."

        "My husband and I just visited this spa whilst we are staying at the King Edward hotel.  Such great service, really friendly, helpful and professional.  My husband had a sports massage with Mark and I had the aromatherapy massage with Caroline.  We both had a great experience, totally relaxing. All our knots and stresses and strains were completely erased.  Both therapists were so friendly and excellent at their jobs.  Maria is also super friendly and full of great tips and hints for things to do in Toronto. A great little spa, totally recommended!"

        "Had a 50 minute Swedish massage with Mark; it was amazing, I have had lots of massages and this guy was a professional with the right techniques. Perfect pressure, absolutely fabulous. The spa is nothing fancy, but the prices are right on and this guy was a fantastic masseuse. I also really liked the owner and other staff members. Very personal and customer service oriented. "

        "Although the owner Maria was nice, our spa experience left little to be desired. ",
        "As I mentioned, yesterday my boyfriend and I came to your spa to experience the \"Time Together\" couples spa package. It was my boyfriend's birthday and he's always wanted to have a manicure and pedicure and I thought King Edward would be a convenient but also an exceptional place for us to get mani/pedis and massages.",
        "Unfortunately it didn't go so well. My boyfriend was given a cheap robe that didn't fit him. This made him feel insecure and ashamed even though it is not his fault for being tall. He mentioned it to me again - calling himself \"too big to fit into King Edward robes\". I said in fact he would probably fit into King Edward robes, but these were the spa robes and not much effort was taken to find a robe that fit. I don't think it would be that difficult to ask the hotel to borrow a robe.",
        "Then when we got into the massage room, we were both disappointed as the room was exceptionally small (not a couples room for sure) and the massage beds were too small for both of us. There was barely enough room for us to move in the chair and our legs were flailing off the bed because of his height. I'm sure you have had other tall people there - I'm curious, what do you do for them? ",
        "I, luckily, enjoyed my massage because I had a good masseuse. My boyfriend, on the other hand, was in excruciating pain after his massage and didn't enjoy one bit of it. I know you can experience a bit of pain after a massage, but he could barely move after.",
        "Our mani/pedis were next and I thought it could only get better from here. Although our aestheticians were excellent, the chair was too small for my boyfriend and since he was already in pain, it made his pain even worse. ",
        "What was supposed to be a relaxing birthday treat for my boyfriend ended up being a nightmare for him that left him feeling insecure and in excruciating pain afterwards. I also felt guilty because I chose to go to your spa and treat him.",
        "We have been to the Four Seasons spa in Toronto among others that all had robes of all sizes - my boyfriend even purchased one after having a phenomenal massage in a good-size massage bed in a beautiful room for two.  ",
        "I thought I would try your spa because I read good reviews and it's also close to  my workplace, but unfortunately, we would never return to your spa and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.",
        "Thank you."

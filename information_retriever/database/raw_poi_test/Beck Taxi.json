        "CANAM Limo cheats its drivers!",
        "Canam Limo is airport taxi and limo service which is based in Burlington, ON.",
        "Canam Limo cheats their drivers, when I found out and told them they created a story and fired me without any reason, hold my money for months and at the end did not give me my money.",
        "I heard this Canam Limo Company cheating its drivers and two of their drivers, I think they left too, told me that they charged client amount of a money but they would not a driver's share exactly. Or let say cheats their drivers. It was hard for me to believe this, but during my work I found out from the two clients talk that this is a true issue: One time I was driving a client to Buffalo Airport and the other one to Pearson airport. When I told them they owner was upset and got angry and told me that they have a third party that work with them. This claim was not true simply. I have all discussions with those clients with their names, phone numbers and emails, but I am keeping it as a respect of privacy of those clients.",
        "One day, 8 months ago, they told me to pick up one of their cars which is parked front of a mechanic shop in Burlington called (‚Ä¶) it was noon and I had a plan to go to pick up one person from Toronto Pearson airport. When I grab a key from mechanic office and I started the car to go I drove the car straight as supposed to be, but I heard scratched voice of a car. I come out and I see the Ford scratched with another small red BMW car. Right away I took several pictures and I sent to the company and I explained that I drove straight but how this happened I do not know. Even I asked them to review the mechanic‚Äôs camera that was not my fault. I took several pictures which showed my started driving was perfect. At the same moment I took several pictures from all side just to make sure was not my fault.",
        "I did not leave the place of the issue and I talked to the owner that was not my fault due to these points, pictures and also video. He told me go for work now and will talk later. I worked regularly more than three weeks. After that they have not sent me any run and I was thinking what was happened. After that I realized the owner send me to work for several weeks just to hijack more money that I work for him. I called them to calculate my runs and give me my money. A financial person calculated my money but one month weeks and months passed nothing happened and I keep emailing and calling where is my money. I knew something happened and they do not send me any ride. After 5 months, I got a call from the owner that he will not give my money because he fixed the scratched car. Even he threatened me that if I ask for it next time he will take my driver license info to some places which is I do not know what is this. I explained to him that this was not my fault and he can check the video and also he has the photos. From his speech I found out this was a trap from him just to fire me and also keep my money, because he was very upset when I asked about the differences of amount of charging clients and the different payment to his drivers. When I requested to meet few weeks ago front of his house he expressed this angriness about asking this issue and he said you do not have right to ask about how we charge clients and how we pay you. I was talking to him in a friendly and quiet way that I would appreciate it if he could give me my money but he refused and got angry. I knew it the act of angriness indicate of something that you are not right."

        "My daughter and I got into a Beck taxi that was in queue outside the Princess of Wales theatre around 10:30pm after a show.  Requested a ride back to the Distillery district. When I went to pay with my debit card, the driver took the card from me, swiped and then inserted it into his machine and then handed me the machine to complete the transaction.  I entered my pin and when the transaction was confirmed, removed my card and exited the cab.  I thought everything was fine.I went grocery shopping the next morning and when I went to pay with my debit card it kept telling me my pin was wrong and I was unable to pay.  I went to my bank where I discovered that the debit card I had was not mine at all.  The cab driver had switched cards on me and had then withdrawn $950 from my account because he had my PIN number from his \"machine\".  The bank told me that Beck Taxi is notorious for fraud schemes and this is a common problem.  DO NOT Ever use Beck Taxi, they are crooks."

He replied that \"I cannot make a U-turn, police will give me a ticket for that.\" I asked him again: \"Why can't you make a U-turn?\". He repeated, this time with a louder voice. I asked him one more time then he yelled at me, saying \"Get the f*** out of my car!\". I called the company to complain, one customer service representative (CSR) filled the report file and told me that a supervisor will look into that and call me back. No one called me back up till now, when I had to call them again. This time a different CSR said that the driver said the different thing, so they don't have any evidence to do anything about it, so I asked to speak with their supervisor. The supervisor again said the same thing, so I asked her what the driver said. She said that the driver stated that he didn't yell or use the F word to me, and that \"I had a beer\" before getting into the cab, so they would just drop it off because they don't actually care about their customers."

        "Beck Taxi have been operating in Toronto for some time; they are identifiable by their pumpkin orange cars.  Travelling in a Beck taxi is something like playing roulette --- you may get to your destination, and you may not.  Many of the drivers are new to Toronto, or seem to be.  One wonders, alarmed, where they learned to drive.  Any available space is fair target for an automobile, and lane changing happens constantly, often at the peril of the neighbouring car(s) or, worse, a law-abiding cyclist. Knowledge of the geography of Toronto is scant. I took a taxi from Union station to York University late in the evening. The driver, to his credit, admitted he did not know the route, so I said I would give easy directions. We ended very near the airport in Mississauga, and I lowered his tip to the minimum. He was furious. York is not a major decision but Yorkdale Mall is, and the same obtained.  In London UK, drivers must pass a rigorious exam of knowledge of the city.  In many years of visiting that city, I can recall only three times when the drivers used a city atlas, even for tiny streets behind streets.  One urges Beck, and other taxi companies, to monitor their drivers very carefully.  A licence from Nation X does not imply that the driver can cope with Canadian urban traffic.  I want to get to heaven in a sweet chariot, not in a dangerous, haphazardly driven cab.  "

        "I take Beck taxis often because there are a lot of them in Toronto. I don't remember ever having boarded one that didn't have a BO smell. Dirty hair, unwashed body, quite gross. Some are worse than others. One was so bad, it almost made my friend and I sick. We didn't have time to change cabs so we opened the windows (in winter) and sat on the edge of the seat, trying not to touch anything. Beck taxis are always very dirty. They don't seem to ever get cleaned. I'm not an advocate of disinfectant (makes bacteria stronger, wash your hands instead), but I think I will carry a pair of latex gloves for when I take a taxi. Imagine the germs on that sticky oily credit card terminal! Then you use your phone and put it against your cheek! Au secours!!!!"

One driver was especially special, my granddaughter was heading for an important audition and asked me if I had an apple she could eat before the audition time, I said I didn‚Äôt. Well the driver opened his lunch bag and gave her his apple, then offered her his banana & his sandwich!!  How special and caring!  We won‚Äôt use any other company than this one from now on. Call the orange & green taxi company!!"

Got charged $70 for the ride when we arrived and said that is the rate. Well talk about taking advantage of people. We took a private limo ride on the return leg and it was only $60."

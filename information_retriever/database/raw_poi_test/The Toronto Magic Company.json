As a magic lover with no friends into it - I attended two of The Art of Magic earlier in the year and it was incredible. Even though I went by myself it did not matter as everyone is so welcoming and I made friends each time. You legit laugh the whole time as all the magicians are hilarious and get to see mind blowing magic! Today I attended the The Newest Trick in the MacBook and it was amazing! Even though it was live on Zoom my mind was still blown! Really appreciate everyone at the Toronto Magic Company! I missed going out to the shows so it was such a special treat to get to watch tonight and it has made my week ;) take care magic friends! Appreciate everyone and take care <3 "

The tricks were really interesting and fresh (at least I haven't seen them before) delivered with a good sense of humor. The show was dynamic and felt festive. I think the kids also really enjoyed the fact that the hosts not only showed the tricks, but also taught a couple of tricks. My son spent the rest of the day trying to master these tricks.

Half of North America is conservative. Lets leave politics out of the show."

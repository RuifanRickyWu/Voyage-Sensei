I didn't get her name but she was great. She had so much information of the islands and the history and the CN tower . I took the 7pm tour so it was around sunset and it was absolutely beautiful. I highly recommend this tour"

        "I took this cruise in 2023 with my daughter and it was fabulous, so we decided to do it again this summer with my son.  My most recent cruise was awful! The boat has changed and it‚Äôs no longer a pontoon type of boat with open sides and a nice breeze to be felt on the water. Today my boat ride was disappointing for numerous reasons. There‚Äôs absolutely NO ventilation of any type on this boat and no basic fans to help move the air. To make matters worse, the window opposite us didn‚Äôt open so there was no cross breeze where we were sitting. Plus as an added bonus an extra staff member, I believe in his break took the ride with the two others who were working, (boat captain and guide) and he blocked the window / door on his front side of the boat the entire ride to keep himself cool while the rest of us had to deal with the heat.  NOT acceptable!!!! ",
        "The commentator last year was fabulous. He really engaged the guests and told us so much about the area.  Today, the guide was just ok, but there was so much missing that my daughter and I remembered from our 2023 ride.",
        "The Toronto harbour is always a great place to visit. It‚Äôs best enjoyed on a beautiful summer day.  I will think twice about taking a boat ride on an enclosed boat like this in the future. I truly would have enjoyed a bigger pontoon type of boat, with room to stand up, perhaps walk around and take pictures, and of course feel the breeze.  This boat felt like a bus and it didn‚Äôt offer any of these things."
